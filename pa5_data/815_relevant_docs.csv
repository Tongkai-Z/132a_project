0,"DEEP IN THE HEART of Virginia coal country sits a mountaintop prison, its remote location an outward expression of the plight of the inhabitants inside. Some 500 of its 745 inmates are held in solitary confinement — 23 hours a day, seven days a week, some for years — with virtually no human contact or meaningful stimulation. Prison officials estimate that 173 of those in solitary suffer from mental illness. Whether the illness was induced by isolation is not known; what is beyond dispute is that isolation exacerbates the problem. This is Red Onion State Prison, as described by The Post’s Anita Kumar. Virginia is one of 44 states that enlist solitary confinement as a way to manage some of its prisoners. Virginia officials estimate that as of this fall roughly 1,800 inmates were kept in isolation, comprising a large chunk of the 25,000 or so prisoners nationwide who find themselves in these conditions every day. Prisoners at Red Onion have been kept in solitary confinement from two weeks to seven years, according to Ms. Kumar’s report, with an average length of stay in segregation of 2.7 years. Virginia officials say that they rely on solitary confinement to manage inmates who are unable to control their rage or who have assaulted corrections officers or other prisoners. Sometimes, they say, a prisoner is placed in a special segregation unit — about the size of a doctor’s exam room — for his own good to avoid being injured by others. Security and safety in a prison must be a top priority, and strategic and limited use of solitary confinement may at time be a necessary tool. But routine reliance on prolonged solitary confinement should never be the default. Short-term isolation is unlikely to cause serious harm. But prolonged solitary confinement can lead to devastating consequences, including psychosis, reduced brain function, debilitating depression and increased rates of suicide. Del. Patrick A. Hope (D-Arlington) and Sen. Adam P. Ebbin (D-Alexandria) are among a group of Virginia lawmakers that have taken notice of the state’s outsized reliance on isolation and have pledged to spur the newly convened General Assembly to study the problem to ensure limited use and the availability of mental health treatment for inmates before they are released into the community. The federal government also has a role to play, and the Justice Department should take up the request by the Legal Aid Justice Center, which represents 12 Virginia inmates who have been held in prolonged isolation, to investigate Virginia’s practices. Other states, including New York and Texas, have moved in the right direction and begun to reduce their reliance on solitary confinement. Virginia should follow suit.

0,"Congress is moving to dramatically tighten economic sanctions against Iran as lawmakers from both major parties express impatience over U.S. efforts to halt the expansion of Iran’s nuclear program. House and Senate officials began crafting legislation this week that congressional leaders say will deepen the pain for Iran across multiple fronts, making it even harder for Iranian businesses to buy insurance, obtain foreign financing and export goods. The proposals, some of which could carry financial risks for U.S. allies as well, have attracted scores of Republican and Democratic sponsors, who say they will push for passage before the August recess. Supporters say the measures would build on sanctions approved last year that helped trim Iran’s oil exports by 40 percent. “What we’ve done so far has been good, but it’s clearly not enough,” said Rep. Howard L. Berman (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is drafting a new sanctions bill. “The pressure needs to intensify.” The search for additional leverage against Iran comes as the Obama administration announced measures intended to expand the list of Iranian companies and individuals covered by existing U.S. sanctions. Treasury Department officials on Thursday named Iran’s main oil tanker conglomerate, the National Iranian Tanker Co., to the U.S. blacklist, along with several suspected front companies and financial institutions accused of helping Iran circumvent restrictions on its oil exports. Some of the firms are alleged to have masked the exports by repainting or reflagging oil tankers to conceal the country of origin, Treasury officials said. The administration also tried to strike at Iran’s ongoing efforts to acquire nuclear and missile technology, listing 11 individuals and groups said to have aided those efforts. “Iran today is under intense, multilateral sanctions pressure, and we will continue to ratchet up the pressure,” David S. Cohen, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the Treasury Department, said in announcing the measures. The demand for new sanctions has been building in Congress since last month, when a third round of nuclear talks between Iran and six world powers in Moscow ended with no visible progress toward a deal on reining in Tehran’s nuclear activities. White House officials had hoped that Iran would agree to concessions to head off an oil embargo and banking-sector sanctions, both of which took effect two weeks ago. Instead, Iran has rejected demands that it shut down the most controversial parts of its nuclear program, including production of a kind of enriched uranium that can be quickly converted into weapons-grade fuel for nuclear bombs. It has refused requests from U.N. inspectors for access to military facilities that U.S. officials suspect were used to test nuclear detonators. The stalled talks have spurred criticism of the Obama administration’s approach to the Iran crisis, leading Republicans and some Democrats to call for more assertive policies, including explicit threats of military force. Supporters of harsher measures point to the White House’s resistance to a package of sanctions that was approved by the Senate last year, in a 100 to 0 vote. “The message from Congress to the administration was clear: Impose crippling sanctions or we will for you,” said Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), a primary sponsor of last year’s sanctions legislation, together with Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). “That message hasn’t changed, and after Moscow, that’s where we’re heading.” The administration, which declined to comment on the new initiatives, has expressed support for tougher sanctions while cautioning against measures that could harm U.S. allies or undermine efforts to build an international consensus against Iran. In private meetings, White House officials have warned that overly broad restrictions could prove costly for Iran’s neighbors such as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, countries that have supported U.S. efforts to isolate Tehran. “After a while it comes a question of ‘Who are you hurting,’ ” said a congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with administration officials. “If you completely cut off Iran’s ability to make payments to some of its neighbors, that’s going to affect these countries’ enthusiasm for helping us further.” Iran’s response to the sanctions has been mixed. After years of dismissing the effect of sanctions, a growing chorus of officials and lawmakers there has acknowledged serious financial harm and called for measures to prop up the country’s economy. But Wednesday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reverted to rhetoric he frequently used before the recent round of nuclear talks began in April. In a speech posted on his Web site, he said Iran was “100 times stronger” today because of three decades of economic sanctions. “These days Westerners are being sensational about sanctions,” Khamenei was quoted as saying, “but they don’t understand that they themselves vaccinated Iran through their sanctions imposed over the last 30 years.” Iranian officials also have taken steps to limit local news accounts describing the economic toll of the sanctions. In commentary on official Iranian Web sites, the head of Iran’s Culture Ministry cautioned journalists against publishing reports contrary to the official line. “Our country is not in a position to allow the media to publish news or analysis which is not compatible with the regime’s and national interests,” the culture minister, Mohammad Hosseini, was quoted as saying. Despite the warning, local newspapers and broadcasters have carried numerous reports highlighting the deteriorating fortunes of key industries such as petroleum and automobile manufacturing, which is down 40 percent over the past year. “We cannot say that this situation is simply because of sanctions,” said Roohollah Beigi, a cleric and member of parliament. “A large part of the issue of high prices is due to mismanagement by the authorities.” Rezaian reported from Tehran.

0,"On Saturday, June 16, devotees of James Joyce will be celebrating Bloomsday. More than 100 years ago, on June 16, 1904, Mr. Leopold Bloom and young Stephen Dedalus separately wandered the streets of Dublin, crossing paths with teachers, priests, medical students, journalists, a woman in labor, publicans, bar maids, drunks, rabid Irish jingoists, sentimental babysitters and at least one adulterer, “Blazes” Boylan, not to overlook Stephen’s shiftless father, Simon, the mourners at Paddy Dignam’s funeral and the whores of the phantasmagoric Nighttown. Eventually, Mr. Bloom rescues Stephen from a Nighttown brawl, and the pair return to 7 Eccles St., where Mrs. Bloom — nee Marion Tweedy and known as Molly — will eventually fall asleep after, yes, the most famous stream-of-consciousness reverie in all of modern literature. That, in a nutshell, is the action of “Ulysses” (1922), generally regarded as the greatest 20th-century novel in English. Of course, there’s a little more to the book than that, as generations of readers, critics, scholars and exegetes well know. Chapters loosely update episodes of Homer’s “Odyssey”; the language sings throughout; narrative conventions are ignored or revolutionized; literary and social taboos are violated (one scene takes place in an outhouse); and the whole book shifts constantly between interior monologue and outward events, between the starkest realism and the subtlest symbolism. “Ulysses” is arguably the most carefully wrought novel ever written — every word, down to its spelling, is there for an artistic reason. It is also a highly autobiographical book, which is why James Joyce’s life has attracted so much attention, starting with the outstanding reminiscences of his school friend Constantine Curran, the transcribed conversations with Frank Budgen, a memoir by his much put-upon younger brother Stanislaus and an early biography by Herbert Gorman. All of these were dwarfed, however, by Richard Ellmann’s monumental “James Joyce,” published in 1959 (revised in 1982) and judged by novelist and Joycean Anthony Burgess, as well as by many readers, as the finest literary biography of the century. Since then, all other biographical writing about Joyce has had to contend with the looming presence of Ellmann’s book. One major critic, Hugh Kenner, strongly lamented its influence, feeling that it had improperly shifted attention away from the work to the life, making the biography, in effect, a fuller, more straightforward version of “Ulysses” and even, to some extent, of the earlier Bildungsroman, “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man” (1916), and the short story collection, “Dubliners” (1914). Bowker begins, naturally enough, with Joyce’s father, John, who married a local beauty, kept her continuously pregnant, lived beyond his means, took to drink and ended up depending on the kindness of his friends and the charity of his children. We learn that over the years Joyce’s early nicknames included “Sunny Jim,” “Half-past six,” “Gussie,” “Kinch,” “The Bard” and “Herr Satan.” Bowker neatly sums up the writer’s boyhood: “As a youngster, he was assertive with his peers and playmates, but scared of dogs and thunderstorms; he was brilliantly precocious yet ready to accept religious instruction unquestioningly; he was pious, yet prone to using vulgar language. That confusion of incompatibles . . . persisted and came also to characterize his fiction.” As he grows older, Joyce exudes the swagger and sense of privilege of the eldest son, adopts an attitude of disdainful irony and superiority to those around him, and generally dismisses ordinary people as “the rabblement.” Above all, he is full of self-importance and poetic posing, inscribing one manuscript: “To my own Soul I dedicate the first true work of my life.” Whenever he meets a notable literary figure, such as the poet W.B. Yeats or the editor Lewis Hind, he behaves like a boor, derides their work and generally comes across as an obnoxious prima donna. At one point, he actually writes a letter to King George V asking him to condone an offensive passage about his father (Edward VII) in “Ivy Day in the Committee Room.”However, when the youthful artiste sends out his later books, he isn’t above inserting slips quoting from the positive reviews of his 1907 poetry collection, “Chamber Music.” In Trieste, Joyce regularly exploits those around him, importing Stanislaus to help pay his rent and one of his sisters to work as the household drudge. Here he lives with Nora Barnacle, the mother of his two children, though he long refuses to marry her. At about this time, he also turns against many of his oldest friends, ostensibly because they have somehow betrayed him. Of course, it might be argued that his often cruel depiction of them in his books constitutes its own betrayal. In his personal life, the young Joyce is thoroughly disreputable. He tends to leave poor Nora alone, while he gets roaring drunk with his cronies and, it would seem, sometimes cheats on her with prostitutes. He is forthright about his sexual fetishes (female underwear, dirty talk, submission and domination) and betrays a prurient obsession with adultery, going so far as to hint that he’d like Nora to have an affair so that he might observe and learn from it. (This would support William Empson’s contention that at the end of “Ulysses” Bloom actually proposes a menage a trois to Stephen.) At one point, Bowker sums up Joyce’s personal obsessions as “fear of betrayal, the unfulfilled marriage, sexual frustration, thwarted ambition, the smothering effects of religion, cruel and casual bigotry, the wretchedness of wasted lives.” Somehow, though, Joyce manages to turn this unsavory material into gloriously comic and deeply moving fiction, characterized by an even more gloriously musical English. “Ulysses” is a book one hears as well as reads. Ultimately, even heroically, James Joyce does use himself up in creating two great masterpieces (the other is 1939’s linguistically multi-layered “Finnegans Wake”), while enduring increasing blindness, depression, world war, bodily ills and considerable family unhappiness, much of it centered on his beloved but mentally troubled daughter Lucia. And then, in 1941, at 58, Dublin’s most famous literary celebrant and exile suddenly, unexpectedly dies from a perforated ulcer and is buried in Zurich, Switzerland, where he and his family had fled after the Nazis invaded Paris. All in all, despite its occasional typos (e.g., “Eumeus” for “Eumaeus”), Gordon Bowker’s “new biography” is well worth reading, even if Joyce comes across as brilliant but exploitative, admirable as an artist but often mortifying as a man. It’s not always a pretty picture, but it seems like a true one. Dirda reviews each Thursday in Style and conducts a book discussion for The Post at wapo.st/reading-room.

0,"TEHRAN — With downgraded nuclear talks with world powers set to begin Tuesday, there are growing signs in Iran that Western sanctions are hurting the nation’s economy and alarming its decision-makers. Authorities remain defiant, but they increasingly are acknowledging publicly the economic pressures that Iran is facing. Their proposed responses range from military confrontation — including renewed threats to block the strategic Strait of Hormuz — to economic countermeasures. The reaction illustrates the range of voices vying for influence at a particularly tense period in the Islamic republic’s history. On the eve of low-level technical talks in Turkey over Iran’s nuclear program, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi warned Monday that “the other side has no choice but to find an agreement; otherwise confrontation will be the alternative,” the semiofficial Iranian Students’ News Agency reported. The talks, following three rounds of unsuccessful negotiations between Iran and six world powers, are aimed at finding enough common ground to salvage the negotiating process. At the same time, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps on Monday began three of days desert missile tests to display its preparedness for airstrikes and show off potential responses. “In view of the enemies’ threats at this juncture, the air defense is one of the highest priority issues for the Islamic republic,” said Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the Revolutionary Guard commander. The highly publicized exercises come amid continuing threats from lawmakers in Tehran that Iran may block the Strait of Hormuz in response to new U.S. and European Union measures against the country’s oil industry. Javad Karimi, a member of parliament’s Commission for National Intelligence and Foreign Policy, said Monday: “There is a plan in parliament to stop tankers that are carrying oil bound for the U.S., E.U. and Israel from passing through the Strait of Hormuz. . . . This is a retaliation against those countries that sanction our oil.” As of Sunday, 100 members of Iran’s 290-seat parliament had signed the measure. Besides flexing its military strength, Iran has been busy addressing its increasingly isolated economy. As the economic realities of life under new sanctions become clearer, the Iranian central bank announced Sunday that it holds a reserve of $150 billion. Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani pledged, “We are implementing programs to counter sanctions, and we will confront these malicious policies.” Bahmani also cautioned that “the rise in prices in the last few days is purely political and psychological,” and he asked Iranians not to give in to such pressures. Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar was more willing to acknowledge the impact of sanctions when he told a meeting of provincial governors Monday: “Sanctions are measures taken by our enemies to stop our progress. We have been able to bypass such problems, though there are difficulties like high prices. But with correct planning we can stop the rise and disappoint our enemies.” Despite such assurances, many Iranians are worried about making ends meet in their new economic situation, as spending power has been decimated in recent months and continues to decline more quickly than the state can react. In response to those concerns, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance announced that the prices of water, cooking gas, electricity and gasoline would not increase this year. These resources were all heavily subsidized until late 2010. Utility prices went up tenfold in some cases when the subsidies were eliminated and replaced by monthly direct payments to more than 90 percent of Iranian citizens. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast blamed the United States and European Union, accusing them of “threatening world security” by implementing sanctions against Iran. “They have to be considered responsible for their actions, which worsen the global economic crisis,” he said. Another source of anti-American rhetoric Monday was the anniversary of the accidental downing of an Iranian commercial airliner by the guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes on July 3, 1988, over the Persian Gulf. Families of the victims gathered, as they do every year, to remember the 290 passengers and crew members who were killed that day. In the calm waters just off Bandar Abbas, the major Iranian port where the flight originated, they held the annual state-sponsored ceremony. In sweltering heat, oil tankers, cargo ships and local fishing boats bobbed in the water, where much of the usual bustle of commerce has ground to a halt as sanctions take greater hold. The port is usually the starting point for Iranian crude oil shipments to global markets, as well as the entryway for smuggled goods to be sold throughout Iran. But these days the most common activity in Bandar Abbas is simply waiting to see what will happen next.

At the same time, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps on Monday began three of days desert missile tests to display its preparedness for airstrikes and show off potential responses. “In view of the enemies’ threats at this juncture, the air defense is one of the highest priority issues for the Islamic republic,” said Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the Revolutionary Guard commander. The highly publicized exercises come amid continuing threats from lawmakers in Tehran that Iran may block the Strait of Hormuz in response to new U.S. and European Union measures against the country’s oil industry. Javad Karimi, a member of parliament’s Commission for National Intelligence and Foreign Policy, said Monday: “There is a plan in parliament to stop tankers that are carrying oil bound for the U.S., E.U. and Israel from passing through the Strait of Hormuz. . . . This is a retaliation against those countries that sanction our oil.” As of Sunday, 100 members of Iran’s 290-seat parliament had signed the measure. Besides flexing its military strength, Iran has been busy addressing its increasingly isolated economy. As the economic realities of life under new sanctions become clearer, the Iranian central bank announced Sunday that it holds a reserve of $150 billion. Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani pledged, “We are implementing programs to counter sanctions, and we will confront these malicious policies.” Bahmani also cautioned that “the rise in prices in the last few days is purely political and psychological,” and he asked Iranians not to give in to such pressures. Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar was more willing to acknowledge the impact of sanctions when he told a meeting of provincial governors Monday: “Sanctions are measures taken by our enemies to stop our progress. We have been able to bypass such problems, though there are difficulties like high prices. But with correct planning we can stop the rise and disappoint our enemies.” Despite such assurances, many Iranians are worried about making ends meet in their new economic situation, as spending power has been decimated in recent months and continues to decline more quickly than the state can react. In response to those concerns, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance announced that the prices of water, cooking gas, electricity and gasoline would not increase this year. These resources were all heavily subsidized until late 2010. Utility prices went up tenfold in some cases when the subsidies were eliminated and replaced by monthly direct payments to more than 90 percent of Iranian citizens. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast blamed the United States and European Union, accusing them of “threatening world security” by implementing sanctions against Iran. “They have to be considered responsible for their actions, which worsen the global economic crisis,” he said. Another source of anti-American rhetoric Monday was the anniversary of the accidental downing of an Iranian commercial airliner by the guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes on July 3, 1988, over the Persian Gulf. Families of the victims gathered, as they do every year, to remember the 290 passengers and crew members who were killed that day. In the calm waters just off Bandar Abbas, the major Iranian port where the flight originated, they held the annual state-sponsored ceremony. In sweltering heat, oil tankers, cargo ships and local fishing boats bobbed in the water, where much of the usual bustle of commerce has ground to a halt as sanctions take greater hold. The port is usually the starting point for Iranian crude oil shipments to global markets, as well as the entryway for smuggled goods to be sold throughout Iran. But these days the most common activity in Bandar Abbas is simply waiting to see what will happen next.

0,"TEHRAN — Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Tuesday that his country should embrace diplomacy over militarism, saying it was time for “heroic leniency,” and signaled his embrace of international outreach efforts by new president Hassan Rouhani. Although Khamenei said the Islamic republic must never abandon its revolutionary ideals and objectives, he said it was time to address Iran’s diplomatic disputes with major world powers. In an interview aired Tuesday evening by the Spanish-language broadcaster Telemundo, President Obama said that an opportunity for diplomacy has arisen. “I hope the Iranians take advantage of it,” he said. “There are indications that Rouhani, the new president, is somebody who is looking to open dialogue with the West and with the United States in a way that we haven’t seen in the past. And so we should test it.” For talks to succeed, Obama said, Iran needs to “show the international community that it’s not trying to weaponize nuclear power.” Obama also reiterated that he had exchanged letters with Rouhani — something the Iranian Foreign Ministry had acknowledged earlier in the day. “I agree with what I called ‘heroic leniency’ years ago,” Khamenei said in a speech Tuesday, “because such an approach is very good and necessary in certain situations, as long as we stick to our main principles.” Khamenei’s words were the clearest indication to date that Rouhani’s government has the supreme leader’s support, which will be essential in reaching any deals with the United States and other world powers over Iran’s nuclear activities. “Rouhani and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, may not have approval from the Islamic republic establishment as a whole, but at this point it looks increasingly clear that they have the support of Ayatollah Khamenei and other key establishment figures,” said Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American Council in Washington. In his speech, Khamenei also rejected the assertion made by some world powers that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons and accused such countries of a three-pronged policy of “making wars, poverty and corruption.” “We do not believe in nuclear weapons because of our beliefs, not for the sake of the U.S. or other countries,” Khamenei said. “And when we say that no country should possess nuclear weapons, we ourselves are definitely not trying to possess them.” Khamenei delivered his speech at a meeting of members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a day after Rouhani addressed the same group. Khamenei told the military commanders that “it is not necessary for the IRGC to be active in the political field, but defending the revolution requires that they understand political realities.” The supreme leader’s comments came just ahead of a scheduled trip to New York by Rouhani and his foreign policy team for the annual U.N.

0,"TEHRAN — Iranian President Hassan Rouhani chose an unlikely setting on Sunday to underscore his government’s new opening to the West — a military parade, which has been used in past years to showcase new weapons or progress on Iran’s nuclear program. In a speech, Rouhani said that if the United States and other Western nations “accept the rights of Iranians, our nation will stand for peace, friendship and cooperation, and together we can solve regional and even global problems.” Although Rouhani touted Iran’s military might and reiterated that it had the right to enrich uranium, he suggested that his government and Western powers could get past their differences — something that few Iranian leaders have conceded in recent years. Rouhani’s speech came two days after he published an opinion piece in The Washington Post in which he called for “constructive engagement” between Iran and the United States. Since winning an election in June, the Iranian leader has also exchanged letters with President Obama and tweeted Rosh Hashanah greetings to Jews around the world. Rouhani is set to depart Monday for New York to attend his first U.N. General Assembly as president. His predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, caused outrage by using his U.N. appearances to cast doubt on the validity of Holocaust data and to question whether Islamist terrorists carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Rouhani and Obama are to speak to the world body on Tuesday, raising the possibility of a face-to-face encounter. Rouhani spoke Sunday at the opening of Iran’s Sacred Defense Week, which commemorates the start of the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq. The parade is held near the mausoleum of the Islamic republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and Iran’s largest cemetery, where tens of thousands of troops killed in the war are buried. Rouhani referred to the Iran-Iraq war in his speech but also sent a message about the conflict in Syria. Iran is a mayor ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “We are against all wars and are ourselves a victim of war and invasion,” he said. “We tell all war­mongers not to consider another war in the region, as it will only bring them regret. War must be stopped by logic, politics and cooperation between regional countries.” Rouhani added that to keep groups backed by al-Qaeda from becoming stronger in Syria, “we must try to bring the Syrian government and opposition to the negotiating table.” Although he did not mention the U.S. government directly, Rouhani appeared to condemn the Obama administration’s frequent statement that “all options are on the table” in the conflict over Iran’s nuclear program. “War and diplomacy have no relation to one another, and no free and logical nation accepts diplomacy and war on the same table,” the Iranian leader said. The U.S. and other Western governments have imposed increasingly harsh sanctions on Iran because of its nuclear program. The West worries that Iran wants to make a bomb; Iran says it is seeking only to develop nuclear energy. Meanwhile, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, a powerful wing of the military that has often opposed engagement with the West — especially the United States — gave Rouhani its conditional support ahead of his trip to New York. The Revolutionary Guard said in a statement Sunday that it “supports any action in the framework of our leader’s strategies and our nation’s interests based on dignity, expediency and logic.” But it also warned Rouhani and his foreign policy team that “historical experience necessitates that our country’s diplomatic authorities cleverly observe, with skepticism, the moves and behavior of the U.S. government.”","TEHRAN — Iranian President Hassan Rouhani chose an unlikely setting on Sunday to underscore his government’s new opening to the West — a military parade, which has been used in past years to showcase new weapons or progress on Iran’s nuclear program.

0,"TEHRAN — The Islamic republic’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, lauded President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday for his diplomatic achievements at the U.N. General Assembly last week but reiterated his skepticism about possible negotiations with Washington. “We support the diplomatic approach of the government and consider diplomatic efforts as important and support what happened in the latest trip,” Khamenei said in his first remarks since Iran’s delegation returned from New York. At the end of his visit, Rouhani spoke briefly by phone with President Obama, the first direct communication between an Iranian leader and a U.S. leader since Iran’s revolution and the founding of the Islamic republic in 1979. The conversation raised prospects for renewed relations between the two countries. But Khamenei stopped short of endorsing rapprochement with Iran’s longtime foe. “We are pessimistic about Americans and have no trust in them. The American government is untrustworthy, disloyal, considers itself superior and breaks its promises,” he said. “Of course, I do not approve of some of what happened in New York,” he added. “But I am optimistic about the diplomacy of our esteemed government.” Khamenei was apparently signaling his disapproval of the phone call, which took place as Rouhani was headed to the airport for his return flight to Tehran. The call, which Obama initiated, has been hailed as a historic shift in relations between the two countries. The short conversation was the culmination of a diplomatic outreach effort by Rouhani and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif.

0,"TEHRAN — Not just anyone is allowed to become president of Iran. But just about anyone can sign up to be considered, and the dozens of candidates who lined up to do so in Tehran on Tuesday offered a window into the uncertainty and confusion surrounding an election that is just six weeks away. By the end of the day, 62 Iranians had registered to become candidates, and hundreds more are expected by the time the process closes Saturday. But in the end, no more than a handful will appear on the ballot, with the approval power vested in an appointed council that reflects the will of Iran’s supreme leader. Some would-be long shots say the proceedings offer an opportunity to be close to power — and to test how willing the country’s clerical establishment may be to tolerate non-mainstream figures. “I am extremely overqualified,’’ said one such candidate, Ali Rahimi, a 59-year-old surgeon, “so I want to see what sort of reason they come up with for refusing my candidacy.’’ A first-time candidate who speaks fluent English, Rahimi said he is a graduate of the University of Kentucky and holds U.S., German and Iranian citizenship. He said he would work to mend the tensions between Iran and the United States that “have been going on for so long over so little.’’ The prospect that any single candidate might win approval to run for president is so small that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad faced only seven Election Day foes when he was first elected president in 2005 — even though 1,014 candidates sought to take part. Some members of Iran’s political establishment think the idiosyncratic registration procedures are bad for the country’s image. Changes to Iran’s election laws proposed last year by parliament would have made it more difficult for so many people to register, but the measure failed, which means the number of candidates is likely to be very high again this year. The final judgment on a candidate is made by a 12-person Guardian Council and is based on qualifications that include education requirements and loyalty to the Islamic revolution and its political system. But the initial process is open to all, and the many who gathered Tuesday inside Iran’s Interior Ministry were asked to take a number from a dispensing machine in a hallway. They were later ushered to an election headquarters to complete paperwork and be fingerprinted. Although many unknowns have signed up, several key political figures — including former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, along with Ahmadinejad’s top adviser, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei — have yet to announce whether they will run. Any of their entries would deeply affect a race that has no clear front-runner. Among the earliest registrants, Hassan Rowhani, a moderate and Iran’s former lead nuclear negotiator who is said to have the support of two former presidents, drew the most attention Tuesday. But there were others who used the opportunity to claim a brief moment in the spotlight. An elderly man, Ali Nasiri, took to an auditorium stage with Koranic verses handwritten across his clothes.

0,"TEHRAN — Two of Iran’s most controversial figures announced Saturday that they are seeking to be candidates to replace Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as Iran’s president. The emergence of two-term former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad’s top aide, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, dramatically changed the landscape of an election that until recently most observers thought would be fought between conservative candidates loyal to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Instead, if confirmed as candidates, both men would be likely to draw support from Iranians who have backed reformists in the past. The arrival of Rafsanjani, 78, at election headquarters here with less than 10 minutes left to register his candidacy caused a frenzy among supporters and journalists, who have speculated in recent weeks that the longtime political figure would enter the race. President from 1989 until 1997, Rafsanjani is considered a founding father of the Islamic Republic and would probably have the support of another former president, Mohammad Khatami. Thought to be one of Iran’s wealthiest people, Rafsanjani has also become a symbol of the corruption that has long afflicted politics here. But others see him as a pragmatic leader who might be able to mend Iran’s relations with the United States. Amid tight security, Rafsanjani made his way through the crowd to the registration center. As he arrived at the designated desk, it became clear that Mashaei, flanked by Ahmadinejad, was registering simultaneously just a few feet away. Afterward, Mashaei and Ahmadinejad entered a hall packed with journalists where the would-be candidate held up an ink-stained finger and his Iranian identity certificate, signifying that he had registered. Like the current president, Mashaei has fallen out of favor with the ruling clerics; some have accused him of being part of a “deviant current” that is opposed to clerical rule. Critics and rivals of Ahmadinejad have accused the current president of trying to employ what they call a “Putin-Medvedev” plan similar to the maneuvers atop Russia’s government, in which Ahmadinejad would stay close to power if Mashaei becomes president and then run for a third term after being out of office for four years, which is allowed under Iran’s constitution. The actions by Rafsanjani and Mashaei instantly infused the race with an energy it had lacked, and their candidacies, if approved, will likely inspire greater voter turnout in the June 14 election. The 12-member Guardian Council has until May 23 to approve or reject prospective candidacies, a decision it bases on factors such as education and loyalty to the Islamic revolution and its political system. The initial process of registering to be a candidate is open to all, and almost 700 Iranians did so during the process that began Tuesday. But only a handful of candidates are expected to ultimately appear on the ballot. Both Rafsanjani and Mashaei have been central players in Iranian politics for years, making it potentially difficult for the council to reject them. Rafsanjani said in the past week that he would run only with the supreme leader’s approval. “Iran’s election picture will remain hazy until vetting is done — perhaps longer,” said Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American Council in Washington. “But today reaffirms Lesson 1 in Iranian politics: Iran has politics.” Saturday also saw several members of the conservative faction known as principlists, for their loyalty to the founding principles of the Islamic republic, enter the race. Most prominent were the mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, and longtime foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati, a pediatrician who trained at Johns Hopkins University. Ghalibaf and Velayati, along with former Parliament speaker Gholam Ali Haddad-Adel, compose a three-candidate coalition. They have agreed to support the one among them with the most public support leading up to the election. Velayati, an adviser to Khamenei, is believed by many to be the head of state’s preferred candidate. Other candidates who registered Saturday included Saeed Jalili, the country’s chief nuclear negotiator; the spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, Ramin Mehmanparast; and Ali Akbar Javanfekr, who formerly ran state television and is a top ally of Ahmadinejad. At least 20 high-ranking politicians were among the many who signed up to become candidates, but it was the emergence of Rafsanjani and Mashaei in the final moments of the registration process that captured the attention of journalists who had been waiting since morning for clarity about whether either man would run. As the afternoon wore on and a procession of conservative candidates arrived, the likelihood that Mashaei or Rafsanjani would appear seemed to fade. As some people left the premises, a surge of activity erupted near the entrance, where riot police and other security forces had gathered earlier. Once Rafsanjani was inside the building, his presence elicited a reaction normally reserved for much younger celebrities: Crowds pushed to get close to him and some people cried, saying he had come to save the country. “This is one of the strange days in our history,” remarked a longtime domestic news photographer who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the event and fear of retribution for being quoted in a U.S. newspaper. Mashaei and Rafsanjani are widely seen here as challengers of the political status quo, but neither hinted at any split between themselves and the ruling system. Rafsanjani told reporters, “I have come to serve our people, and they have the right to vote for me or not.” Asked what he would do if the Guardian Council rejects his candidacy, Mashaei replied, “We all must accept the law, and so do I.” After Mashaei addressed reporters, Ahmadinejad spoke in support of his top aide, who is married to the president’s daughter. “It is 28 years that I’ve known Mashaei. He is a believer. He’s pious and practical,” Ahmadinejad said, adding, “Mashaei is Ahmadinejad, and Ahmadinejad is Mashaei.”","TEHRAN — Two of Iran’s most controversial figures announced Saturday that they are seeking to be candidates to replace Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as Iran’s president.

The initial process of registering to be a candidate is open to all, and almost 700 Iranians did so during the process that began Tuesday. But only a handful of candidates are expected to ultimately appear on the ballot. Both Rafsanjani and Mashaei have been central players in Iranian politics for years, making it potentially difficult for the council to reject them. Rafsanjani said in the past week that he would run only with the supreme leader’s approval. “Iran’s election picture will remain hazy until vetting is done — perhaps longer,” said Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American Council in Washington. “But today reaffirms Lesson 1 in Iranian politics: Iran has politics.” Saturday also saw several members of the conservative faction known as principlists, for their loyalty to the founding principles of the Islamic republic, enter the race. Most prominent were the mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, and longtime foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati, a pediatrician who trained at Johns Hopkins University. Ghalibaf and Velayati, along with former Parliament speaker Gholam Ali Haddad-Adel, compose a three-candidate coalition. They have agreed to support the one among them with the most public support leading up to the election. Velayati, an adviser to Khamenei, is believed by many to be the head of state’s preferred candidate. Other candidates who registered Saturday included Saeed Jalili, the country’s chief nuclear negotiator; the spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, Ramin Mehmanparast; and Ali Akbar Javanfekr, who formerly ran state television and is a top ally of Ahmadinejad. At least 20 high-ranking politicians were among the many who signed up to become candidates, but it was the emergence of Rafsanjani and Mashaei in the final moments of the registration process that captured the attention of journalists who had been waiting since morning for clarity about whether either man would run. As the afternoon wore on and a procession of conservative candidates arrived, the likelihood that Mashaei or Rafsanjani would appear seemed to fade. As some people left the premises, a surge of activity erupted near the entrance, where riot police and other security forces had gathered earlier. Once Rafsanjani was inside the building, his presence elicited a reaction normally reserved for much younger celebrities: Crowds pushed to get close to him and some people cried, saying he had come to save the country. “This is one of the strange days in our history,” remarked a longtime domestic news photographer who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the event and fear of retribution for being quoted in a U.S. newspaper. Mashaei and Rafsanjani are widely seen here as challengers of the political status quo, but neither hinted at any split between themselves and the ruling system. Rafsanjani told reporters, “I have come to serve our people, and they have the right to vote for me or not.” Asked what he would do if the Guardian Council rejects his candidacy, Mashaei replied, “We all must accept the law, and so do I.” After Mashaei addressed reporters, Ahmadinejad spoke in support of his top aide, who is married to the president’s daughter. “It is 28 years that I’ve known Mashaei. He is a believer. He’s pious and practical,” Ahmadinejad said, adding, “Mashaei is Ahmadinejad, and Ahmadinejad is Mashaei.”"
0,"TEHRAN — A former president supported by Iran’s moderates and considered a founding member of the Islamic republic was disqualified Tuesday from running in the coming election, generating surprise and tension. In addition to two-term ex-president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Ahmadinejad’s top aide, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, was also disqualified from the June 14 presidential ballot, although no immediate reason was given. Both men were last-minute and somewhat controversial registrants, but their omission could cause a backlash from rivals of Iran’s conservative establishment. Conservatives including Tehran’s mayor, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, former foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati and the country’s lead nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, dominate the list of eight candidates approved by the Guardian Council. Large groups of riot police, the kind that were on Tehran’s streets in the days after the contested 2009 reelection of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, patrolled on motorcycles throughout the capital Tuesday for the first time in more than a year, perhaps in anticipation of the candidate announcement. Many people had anticipated Mashaei’s disqualification because of attempts he and Ahmadinejad had made to undermine the authority of Iran’s clergy. But Rafsanjani’s removal from the race was less expected, despite a systematic campaign to discredit the 78-year-old’s potential candidacy that began almost as soon as he signed up Saturday in the final moments of the registration process. Although criticisms of his record and long-standing allegations of corruption have followed him for years, some observers said it was perhaps Rafsanjani’s advanced age, which his detractors focused on over the weekend, that led to his disqualification. Rafsanjani is acknowledging and apparently accepting his disqualification, turning attention to how Mashaei and Ahmadinejad will respond to the decision. With no other candidates from their political alliance running, domestic news agencies carried a statement late Tuesday night from Mashaei’s campaign asking for reconsideration of the Guardian Council’s decision to disqualify him. “We ask our supreme leader to help us in this case, because we know that under his leadership there will not be any injustices or if any mistakes have been made they can be corrected,” the statement read. The council’s spokesman, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, however, told state television that there would be no period for appeals as official campaigning begins Thursday. Among the eight approved candidates, only two are considered to be non-conservatives: Mohammad Aref, who served as vice president during reformist Mohammad Khatami’s first term, and Hassan Rouhani, who was Iran’s lead nuclear negotiator during the Rafsanjani and Khatami years. Rouhani is closely aligned with both former presidents, and his campaign is expected to receive their support. Although it appears unlikely this time, candidates in previous elections have successfully appealed disqualifications by the Guardian Council, going on to appear on election ballots.","TEHRAN — A former president supported by Iran’s moderates and considered a founding member of the Islamic republic was disqualified Tuesday from running in the coming election, generating surprise and tension.

0,"TEHRAN —  Iran’s conservatives, who on Tuesday saw the two main moderate threats to their dominance  barred from running  in next month’s presidential election, face a new challenge: persuading shocked and skeptical Iranians to turn out to vote.  With the field of hopefuls clear, the mostly conservative nominees whose candidacies were approved by Iran’s Guardian Council officially launched their campaigns Wednesday, apparently free from the challenges of the most talked-about candidates, two-time former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the top aide to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, ­Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei. Of the eight approved candidates, Iran’s lead nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, who is a close adviser to the country’s supreme leader, appears to have mounting support among conservative politicians. But he cannot credibly claim popular backing, never having won an election, and his platform of “resistance” is unlikely to win votes from a populace eager for relief from the international economic sanctions imposed on Iran because of its nuclear activities. Many Iranians seemed more interested in the fates of the two big names who were rejected than in those who were cleared to run, and it remained uncertain Wednesday how Iran’s leaders intend to try to revive the interest sparked by the surprise candidacies of Rafsanjani and Mashaei. “I swear that every passenger who sat in this car in the past week said they would only vote for the old lion, Rafsanjani,” said a Tehran taxi driver who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisal. “I don’t think any of them will vote now.” Ahmadinejad on Wednesday denounced the decision to disqualify Mashaei and suggested he would use his influence to have it reversed. “I introduced Mashaei because I know him as pious and a fair manager,” Ahmadinejad said in comments posted on his Web site. “I will follow up the matter with the supreme leader until the last minute and hopefully it will get solved.” Security in Tehran was elevated Wednesday, with riot police stationed at major squares, but there were no reports of unrest. Iran’s volatile currency market also responded to Tuesday’s announcement with a drop in value of nearly 3 percent Wednesday morning, offering a glimpse of how the bazaar views the remaining candidates and their potential effect on the economy. The brief candidacies of Rafsanjani and Mashaei, announced simultaneously on the final day of registration Saturday, had many parallels, but their forced exits from the race highlighted the differences in their ties to Iran’s power structure and hinted at the roles they may play in future. Mohammad-Reza Sadeq, an adviser to Rafsanjani, said in a statement that the former president would “definitely announce his opinion of the Guardian Council’s decision, but his background shows that he always moves in the framework of law and national interest” — suggesting that Rafsanjani is unlikely to publicly challenge his disqualification. Mashaei, with Ahmadinejad’s unwavering support, is less likely to quietly step aside, which could result in even greater hostility between their team and the conservative establishment. His campaign issued a statement almost immediately after his disqualification, urging Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and Ahmadinejad to intervene to overturn the Guardian Council’s decision. Cultivating interest in the June 14 vote now falls to Iran’s state media, with none of the candidates having a nationwide base of popular support. After their names were announced on state television Tuesday night, a pre-taped introduction to each was aired in which they briefly present their campaign pledges. Besides Jalili, the three candidates seen as having the best chances are Ali Akbar Velayati, a former foreign minister and longtime adviser to Khamenei; Hassan Rouhani, a former lead nuclear negotiator; and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the mayor of Tehran. Ghalibaf, an early favorite, suffered a blow last week when an audiotape surfaced in which he allegedly takes responsibility for violently suppressing protesters in 2003. His campaign team said the recording was doctored and released by his political adversaries. Despite the setback, Ghalibaf is considered the candidate with the most popular support, and he is the only one who has won a major election. “My basic slogan is to solve economic problems and make a good life, materially and spiritually, for the people. The main point is to return hope, stability and peace to the society,” Ghalibaf said in his recorded message. He and Jalili are expected to vie for the support of Iran’s conservative establishment. The two most moderate candidates left in the race, Rouhani and former first vice president Mohammad-Reza Aref, are not seen as posing a major threat. That could change, though, as former presidents Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami are expected to throw their support behind Rouhani.","TEHRAN —  Iran’s conservatives, who on Tuesday saw the two main moderate threats to their dominance  barred from running  in next month’s presidential election, face a new challenge: persuading shocked and skeptical Iranians to turn out to vote.

0,"TEHRAN — Eight competitors in the race to replace Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad began their three-week-long campaign sprint over the weekend, holding almost daily events and dominating the country’s radio and television airwaves. Although many here think there is little that differentiates the candidates — aside from the details of their pledges to improve on what they say is Ahmadinejad’s mismanagement — visits to campaign rallies and candidate headquarters reveal the many facets of Iranian politics and society. Compared with the colorful scenes ahead of the 2009 election, this year’s presidential campaign is subdued. With printers and publishers under an advisory to conserve paper products, which have become much more expensive because of economic sanctions, the capital is mostly void of the campaign posters and discarded fliers and brochures that accompanied previous Iranian elections. Gone, too, are the one-on-one live televised debates that many analysts thought led to 2009’s lively campaign atmosphere and the unrest after that election. Instead, debates use a panel format similar to that in the United States. Since the disqualification of the highest-profile candidates — former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad aide Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei — the man getting the most attention is Iran’s lead nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili. His rally Friday in a central Tehran stadium provided the first public glimpse of a man most Iranians know little about. Outside the arena, a young man, holding a cardboard box covered in pictures of Jalili, asked for campaign donations and suggestions. Other volunteers handed out fliers explaining why people should vote for him. About 3,000 supporters — the biggest crowd seen at a campaign event this year — filled the stadium, fanning themselves under a banner that read, “Resistance is the password to progress.” The crowd represented the hopes and ideals of the 1979 Islamic revolution, which still resonates with Iranians who fought or lost loved ones in the eight-year war with Iraq that followed in the 1980s. Jalili lost part of his leg in that conflict, and many injured veterans of the war were in the audience. “Anyone who becomes the next Iranian president must continue on the path of the Islamic revolution and must use all available resources to achieve the objectives of the revolution,” Jalili told the crowd, possibly the largest audience he has ever addressed. “We’re engaged in a real war with America in the form of the sanctions we’re under, and Jalili understands this,” said Hassan Roozitalab, an online editor who brought his infant daughter to the rally. “Our economic problems will be solved domestically, and to do that, we need to use the potential we have in this country.” Jalili’s message of economic resistance and Islamic purity does not appeal to large segments of urban Iran, however. “I’m really worried about what will happen if people like these get more power. We thought those days were over,” said a female passerby who would not give her name. Like many Iranians interviewed, she said she did not plan to vote. At a mosque in the northeastern corner of Tehran, about 200 mostly middle-aged, middle-class men gathered on Saturday for evening prayers and to hear Ali Akbar Velayati, a longtime foreign minister and a physician trained at Johns Hopkins University, offer his plan for his presidency. Velayati is touting his foreign policy experience as the reason Iranians should vote for him. His and Jalili’s supporters appeared to come from similar social backgrounds. At both campaign events, young men in their 20s — born more than a decade after the 1979 revolution that led to the formation of the Islamic republic — circulated, telling female attendees to mind their head coverings and to dress modestly. Hassan Rouhani, the only cleric among the eight candidates and a former lead nuclear negotiator, is the one touting the most liberal-minded agenda. His speeches have focused on repairing Iran’s international image and addressing the concerns of the country’s ethnic and tribal minorities as well as those of non-Muslims and women, themes that have rarely entered the Iranian political discourse in recent years. On Sunday, Rouhani met with a contingent of Azeri Turks, Iran’s largest minority group. “I want to see what Rouhani’s stances are, to see if he’s really with the reformists or not. If he is, I’ll vote for him,” said Romina, a 27-year-old Azeri office worker who did not want her last name published for fear of government reprisals.

0,"The Obama administration launched an offensive against Iranian censorship on Thursday, announcing measures intended to help ordinary Iranians acquire smartphones and computer software to thwart government eavesdroppers. The key step, a “general license” issued by the Treasury Department, gives private companies permission to sell communications equipment to Iranians, overriding trade restrictions that had limited legitimate sales of phones and computer gear to the Islamic Republic. U.S. officials said the action, coming two weeks before Iran’s presidential elections, would make it easier for ordinary Iranians to obtain unfiltered news or to talk freely to people outside the country. “Freedom of speech, assembly and expression are universal human rights,” David S. Cohen, the Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in announcing the move. “We will use all the tools at our disposal . . . to help the Iranian people exercise these basic rights.” Administration officials said the effort is a response to new Iranian efforts to stifle political expression and cut off access to foreign news. Four years after the disputed 2009 presidential election, Tehran is taking more aggressive steps to silence dissent and prevent government opponents from communicating with one another, a senior administration official said. “We continue to be gravely concerned by human rights abuses by Iranian government officials, including in surveillance and in disruption of communication and access to the media,” said the official, who insisted on anonymity as one of the ground rules for a briefing to journalists on the measures. By loosening restrictions on sales of communications equipment, Iranians will have improved access to smartphones, satellite phones, satellite dishes and computer software that blocks hackers and spyware, the official said. The likely impact inside Iran is far from certain. While certain Western brands are officially banned from being sold inside Iran — Apple, for example, restricts sales of its products in Iran — most are widely available in Iranian stores, sometimes at lower prices compared with Western retailers. A bigger challenge for many ordinary Iranians is obtaining anti-filtering software to access social media sites. In recent years, Iranian authorities have become better at defeating the most commonly available computer tools that allow Iranians to circumvent government controls on the Internet. In a related move, administration officials announced new sanctions and visa restrictions on dozens of Iranian individuals and companies the White House has linked to alleged human rights abuses stemming from Iran’s 2009 crackdown on the country’s Green Revolution protests. Jason Rezaian in Tehran contributed to this report.","The Obama administration launched an offensive against Iranian censorship on Thursday, announcing measures intended to help ordinary Iranians acquire smartphones and computer software to thwart government eavesdroppers.

Cohen, the Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in announcing the move. “We will use all the tools at our disposal . . . to help the Iranian people exercise these basic rights.” Administration officials said the effort is a response to new Iranian efforts to stifle political expression and cut off access to foreign news. Four years after the disputed 2009 presidential election, Tehran is taking more aggressive steps to silence dissent and prevent government opponents from communicating with one another, a senior administration official said. “We continue to be gravely concerned by human rights abuses by Iranian government officials, including in surveillance and in disruption of communication and access to the media,” said the official, who insisted on anonymity as one of the ground rules for a briefing to journalists on the measures. By loosening restrictions on sales of communications equipment, Iranians will have improved access to smartphones, satellite phones, satellite dishes and computer software that blocks hackers and spyware, the official said. The likely impact inside Iran is far from certain. While certain Western brands are officially banned from being sold inside Iran — Apple, for example, restricts sales of its products in Iran — most are widely available in Iranian stores, sometimes at lower prices compared with Western retailers. A bigger challenge for many ordinary Iranians is obtaining anti-filtering software to access social media sites. In recent years, Iranian authorities have become better at defeating the most commonly available computer tools that allow Iranians to circumvent government controls on the Internet. In a related move, administration officials announced new sanctions and visa restrictions on dozens of Iranian individuals and companies the White House has linked to alleged human rights abuses stemming from Iran’s 2009 crackdown on the country’s Green Revolution protests.

0,"TEHRAN — The eight candidates taking part in Iran’s first televised presidential debate Friday agreed on one thing: They did not like the format imposed by the Islamic Republic’s state broadcaster. The four-hour telecast focused on the economy, seen as the main issue in the June 14 election, and provided a first look at the presidential hopefuls gathered in what was presumably intended as a more spontaneous setting than their choreographed campaign appearances. No major revelations or policy plans emerged. In the first round, a moderator drew from a bowl the name of a candidate who then had three minutes to answer a question drawn from another bowl. After that, each of the seven other candidates had 90 seconds to respond. At the end of the round, following a short break, former vice president Mohammad Reza Aref complained that the format did not allow the men to actually compete. From then on, the event appeared to go off script, as candidates repeatedly said that the questions in the second round — which consisted of a series of yes-or-no and multiple-choice questions, as well as photographs of domestic scenes that they were asked to interpret — were “mistaken” or “incomplete.” “This style of debate is beneath the dignity of the eight candidates and the nation,” said Aref, who declined to answer any questions in the second round, responding only, “I have no opinion.”","TEHRAN — The eight candidates taking part in Iran’s first televised presidential debate Friday agreed on one thing: They did not like the format imposed by the Islamic Republic’s state broadcaster.

0,"TEHRAN — In their third and final televised debate Friday, Iran’s eight presidential candidates traded pointed accusations, including blaming one of their number for his role in responding to anti-government protests and criticizing another for the lack of progress in talks on the country’s nuclear program. Political differences quickly turned personal, with several candidates bringing up episodes from their rivals’ careers that many might have preferred to keep in the shadows, offering a rare glimpse into the often bitter disputes that roil the top echelons of the Islamic republic’s political system. But after two lackluster debates that viewers and participants alike criticized for their lack of substance and competitiveness, Friday’s clashes may provide some of the spark that Iranian authorities have been seeking to energize what has been a low-energy campaign, generating little public interest. Former foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati, a Johns Hopkins-trained pediatrician, slammed the job performance of Iran’s current lead nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili. “You were in charge of the nuclear case for several years, and we haven’t taken a single step forward,” Velayati said, denouncing Jalili’s avowed “resistance” policy. “Diplomacy isn’t about toughness or stubbornness.” Both men are considered part of the conservative wing of Iranian politics and close to the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In one of the first instances of a reformist politician publicly voicing frustration about the repressive aftermath of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s 2009 reelection, former vice president Mohammad Reza Aref said, “I don’t want to open the case of 2009, but I silenced myself for four years, and I was in pain.” Aref complained that several of his supporters had been arrested at a recent campaign event but urged Iranians to vote anyway on June 14, saying in his closing statement, “Not voting is not the way to express your protest.” The debate’s most heated exchange took place between Tehran’s mayor, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, and former lead nuclear negotiator Hassan Rouhani, the only cleric in the race. After Rouhani said that, if he is elected, his government would “provide security and tranquility to all Iranians.” Ghalibaf challenged him, accusing Rouhani of selectivity about who should benefit from such protection. He was referring to Rouhani’s failure to give protesters permission to rally in 2003, when he was head of the Supreme National Security Council. The protests took place anyway and spiraled out of control, leading to three weeks of unrest. Ghalibaf headed Iran’s police forces at the time, and a recently released recording from which he has been trying to distance himself has him taking credit for suppressing the 2003 protests. Visibly surprised by Ghalibaf’s admonition, Rouhani responded: “I have so much information in my memory, but I’m not willing to destroy my opponents, nor am I willing to expose top-secret documents. I’m not arguing about what police did at that time.

0,"TEHRAN — This capital city was calm on Sunday after a long night of spontaneous street celebrations following the surprise victory of president-elect Hassan Rouhani, a cleric whose moderate views have inspired hope among Iranians eager for new personal freedoms and quick social change. But those voters are likely to be disappointed, at least in the short term, as Rouhani sends signals that his agenda will instead be dominated by measured efforts to revive Iran’s sagging economy and improve its relations with the rest of the world. “Rouhani’s victory in 2013 is the Iranian equivalent to Obama’s victory in 2008: an electorate that voted overwhelmingly for hope and change, understanding that the process will be a marathon, not a sprint,” said Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American Council in Washington. Days before his election, Rouhani pledged to return value to the plummeting Iranian currency and “respect” to Iranian passports — a reference to the very limited number of countries to which Iranians can travel visa-free. And on Sunday, Rouhani said he had made his first policy-shaping move by discussing economic woes and living conditions with Ali Larijani, head of Iran’s majority-conservative parliament. There were early indications that Rouhani’s win could be a stabilizing force on Sunday, as the battered Iranian rial rebounded 5 percent against the dollar, a sign that the country’s business community had also been buoyed by the election results. But Rouhani warned that the economy, wounded by Iran’s mismanagement of oil wealth and international sanctions over the country’s nuclear program, would not recover immediately. “Although our problems won’t be solved overnight, we must work on them gradually and in consultation with experts,” Rouhani said, according to the semi-official ISNA news agency. Rouhani’s supporters tout his diplomatic skills and prospects for unifying Iran’s polarized political landscape. But as a onetime holder of top positions in Iran’s most important ministries, a lawmaker for 20 years and a former lead nuclear negotiator, he is also the definition of an Islamic republic insider. That has made him adept at navigating the many competing centers of Iranian power — and disinclined to rock the boat. On Sunday, state television reported that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who retains the final word on Iranian policy, including its nuclear program, issued “necessary guidelines” to Rouhani during their first meeting since the Friday vote. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps, an elite military branch that controls vast wealth, said that it is ready for “complete cooperation with the new government in the framework of its responsibilities,” an oblique message to Rouhani that it will not be an impediment as long as he does not overstep boundaries. According to ISNA, Rouhani described his meeting with Larijani as “the first step today in creating cooperation between the two branches in the near future,” an apparent reference to years of tension between the parliament and the outgoing administration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In images broadcast on state television, Rouhani and Larijani — also a former lead nuclear negotiator — appeared comfortable together and pledged to work hand in hand to lower unemployment and stabilize rampant inflation, which official statistics placed at more than 30 percent last month. Neither the reform movement that began in the 1990s nor the conservative current that has dominated Iranian politics over the past eight years has succeeded in fully implementing its agendas, and Rouhani’s early moves seemed to signal a strategy of bridging those divides. On Saturday, Rouhani, who captured 51 percent in a field of six candidates, called his lopsided win a “victory of moderation over extremism.” “I hope even those who voted for other candidates consider me fit to serve them, because I consider myself protector of the rights of all people of Iran,” he said in a victory statement. On Sunday, domestic media ran scathing editorials about the inability of conservatives — known here as principlists — to work together and their lack of results as leaders. “Principlists must be defeated so the wave of change can start blowing in this country,” wrote the editors of the Tabnak Web site, which is affiliated with one of the conservative candidates whom Rouhani defeated, Mohsen Rezaie. Early pledges of cooperation from a range of competing factions indicated that Rouhani might have the political capital to become a unifier. Even conservatives emphasized moderation. Conservative lawmaker Ali Motahhari said he hoped the president-elect “includes conservatives in his cabinet and that it is a mix of moderate principlists and moderate reformists, becoming the symbol of moderation.” But moderation might disappoint the tens of thousands who poured into streets across Iran on Saturday night, many of whom chanted the names and slogans of Iran’s opposition leaders. While campaigning, Rouhani pledged to address Iran’s policies on women and minority rights, social restrictions and access to information. He also vowed to work to free political prisoners, and many supporters of the reform movement are waiting to see how he handles the house arrests of Mehdi Karoubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi, the leaders of the protest movement that followed Iran’s disputed 2009 elections. “I really don’t think he can do much to fix the economy, because there are so many factors involved, but I do expect him to do something about social restrictions as he promised he would,” said Marjan, 32, a high school teacher and Rouhani supporter who declined to provide her last name, fearing government reprisal.","TEHRAN — This capital city was calm on Sunday after a long night of spontaneous street celebrations following the surprise victory of president-elect Hassan Rouhani, a cleric whose moderate views have inspired hope among Iranians eager for new personal freedoms and quick social change.

0,"Mehdi Khalaji is a senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The recent presidential election in Iran proved that the Islamic Republic’s instinct for self-preservation trumps its ideology. Hassan Rouhani, the current representative of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the Supreme National Security Council and former head nuclear negotiator, won the election in the first round, a total surprise for both international observers and domestic critics of the regime. Despite his establishment credentials and his status as a cleric, Rouhani was not regarded as Khamenei’s favorite candidate. Saeed Jalili, the chief nuclear negotiator; Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, former chief of the national police and current mayor of Tehran; and Ali Akbar Velayati, former minister of foreign affairs and Khamenei’s advisor on international affairs, were expected to have Khamenei’s support in this election. The nuclear impasse with Iran is by no means over, but at least the Iranian people have shown that they want a change of approach. Many of those who voted for Rouhani may have thought like political prisoner Emad Bahavar, who said that while Rouhani is no pro-democracy figure, his victory may change the power equation in favor of democracy by weakening the military, political and economic institutions run by Khamenei. Rouhani is solidly in the conservative camp, but he ran a campaign positioning himself as the most moderate person allowed to run. The main theme of Rouhani’s campaign was his critique of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear policy during the last eight years, which led to a series of U.N, E.U. and U.S. sanctions against Iran. Not only were the business community and private sector deeply damaged by sanctions, but the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s companies and government businesses also came under unprecedented pressure. The current policy left little hope for peaceful resolution of the nuclear crisis and, because of sanctions, made the impasse the first concern of many Iranian citizens, both urban and rural. In the televised debates and his campaign, Rouhani has defended the pre-Ahmadinejad nuclear policy, which he ran from 2003 to 2005. He argued that he succeeded in keeping the nuclear program off the U.N. Security Council’s agenda while also preventing a significant interruption to the program. He said that Iran should change its negotiation pattern, assure the West that it is not after a nuclear bomb and save the economy from sanctions, while letting Iran’s peaceful nuclear program proceed. He described the 2003-04 decision to suspend uranium enrichment for a few months as a way for Iran to prove that the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes while at the same time make progress on the enrichment program during the suspension. Rouhani’s victory can be interpreted as the success of the West’s policy toward Iran’s nuclear program. Since the start of sanctions, many have doubted whether sanctions are useful, and whether they would change Iran’s nuclear policy, but the 2013 election proved that sanctions deeply affected people’s opinions of the government’s policy of resistance rather than compromise. During the campaign, many of the candidates criticized the resistance approach, which was defended only by current nuclear negotiator Jalili. Even Velayati — who has been regarded as an influential advisor to the supreme leader— criticized Jalili in the televised debate,saying Jalili’s policy harmed Iran and produced zero benefit. To be sure, sanctions weren’t the only reason Rouhani won. Unlike many classic dictatorships such as Iraq under Saddam Hussein, the political power in Iran is not monopolized by one group and person. Tiny holes that open in the election season sometimes provide a chance for new dynamism. Of course, elections in Iran are neither free nor fair because candidates are selected by Khamenei’s Guardian Council; in this election, the range of candidates approved was particularly narrow. To a considerable extent that helped Rouhani, because the candidates closest to Khamenei did not unify their constituencies. Without any one candidate having the clear support of the Supreme Leader or the Revolutionary Guards, the hard-line vote was split. And there are some indications that Khamenei might not have been totally in support of Rouhani’s rivals. In an unprecedented statement few days before the election, he asked the opponents of the Islamic Republic to participate in the election for the sake of the country. This was the first time that Iran’s supreme leader asked for help from the Islamic Republic’s opponents. And in one of his campaign speeches, Rouhani said, “Let me tell you vaguely that what happened in 2009 would not happen in 2013” — implying that this time, Khamenei’s team would pay attention to people’s votes. Unlike 2009, there was no serious report of fraud in the election and all candidates accepted the results. Nevertheless, the West now should have more confidence in the negotiations because the Iranian people showed that they are not indifferent to the leverages used against nuclear policy — and indeed the hard-line elite showed it is deeply split over how to proceed on the nuclear front. But one should not forget that Rouhani’s justification for negotiations during the campaign was to relieve the pressure without giving up the program. This means that while the West should approach negotiations with cautious optimism, the West has to remain insistent on Iran having only a peaceful nuclear program that is verifiably far from a nuclear weapons capability. And of course, Iran’s president does not dominate Iran’s foreign and security policy, which is overwhelmingly set by Khamenei, though the fact that Khamenei allowed Rouhani to win suggests that Khamenei himself may be open to a shift in approach.

0,"JERUSALEM — The first substantive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in years will begin Monday evening in Washington, the Obama administration announced, after Israeli leaders agreed Sunday to release 104 Palestinian prisoners. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the preliminary talks will be led by Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. The talks, which will continue Tuesday, are expected to address the framework for full negotiations to follow — the talks about talks that had preceded past attempts at a deal. The release of Palestinian prisoners was one of the major roadblocks to the peace talks. Calling the prisoner decision “painful for the entire nation,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won the approval of his divided cabinet earlier Sunday to release the Palestinian inmates, many convicted of killing Israelis, to help restart peace talks brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry. The list of prisoners who may be released in coming days includes militants who threw firebombs, in one case at a bus carrying children; stabbed and shot civilians, including women, elderly Jews and suspected Palestinian collaborators; and ambushed and killed border guards, police officers, security agents and soldiers. All of them have been in prison for at least two decades; some were serving life sentences. The Israeli public views these prisoners as terrorists who have blood on their hands. Palestinians see them as freedom fighters struggling to reclaim their homeland and oust the occupiers. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his leadership refused to return to the negotiating table without their release. Regardless of whether it is a grudging gesture of goodwill, diplomatic blackmail or something in between, Netanyahu’s move is a major concession to Kerry and the Palestinians. In a sign of Israeli divisions over the prisoner release, the vote among Netanyahu’s cabinet ministers was 13 to 7, with two abstentions. In a parallel move, the cabinet also approved Netanyahu’s call for a national referendum that would allow voters to approve or reject any peace deal he makes. Israeli officials said the prisoners will be released in four stages over the next nine months, with the first release to take place soon after the initial talks in Washington. Erekat called it “a step toward peace” and said, “I hope that we can use this opportunity that the U.S. has provided for us to resume negotiations,” according to the Associated Press. More prisoners would be freed as negotiations continue, though Netanyahu warned that “every Palestinian provocation will result in halting of the prisoner-release process.” The Israeli prime minister called the prisoners he was about to release “depraved people, even if most of them have been in prison for over 20 years.” This is not the first time that Netanyahu has struck such a deal. In 2011, the Israeli government traded about 1,000 Palestinian and Arab Israeli prisoners for the release of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier abducted by Hamas militants near the Kerem Shalom crossing into the Gaza Strip in 2006. He had been held for five years. In an “open letter to Israeli citizens” published Saturday night, Netanyahu explained, “This is an incomparably difficult decision, it is painful for the bereaved families and it is painful for the entire nation and it is also very painful for me.” Kerry, who has made several visits to the region since taking office in February to nudge the Israelis and Palestinians closer to negotiations, said last week that the possibility of finally resolving a conflict that has spanned more than 60 years is the“granddaddy” of international diplomacy. On Thursday, Kerry chaired a special session of the U.N. General Assembly, during which he praised Israeli and Palestinian leaders for their “courageous decision to try to return to final-status talks.” State Department officials who briefed reporters on his effort last week said the goal is intensive talks over about nine months. The agreement would set West Bank borders and include promises about Israel’s security once it no longer occupies the West Bank. Although most polls show that a majority of Israelis support the peace process, releasing prisoners is unpopular across the political spectrum. “From time to time, prime ministers are called on to make decisions that go against public opinion — when the matter is important for the country,” Netanyahu said in the open letter. He added: “It seems to me that it is very important for the State of Israel to enter into a diplomatic process.” The prime minister said dramatic change in the region — in Egypt, Syria and Iran — create not only challenges but also “considerable opportunities for us” to strike a deal with the Palestinians. Netanyahu stressed that although he agreed to release prisoners — and to do so only after talks begin — he rejected a Palestinian demand for a freeze on new construction in the Jewish settlements in the West Bank. According to Israeli media, Netanyahu told Kerry that over the next nine months, as many as 1,000 new units may be approved for construction in West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements. Netanyahu was silent on a third Palestinian demand — that negotiations about borders for a future Palestinian state begin with the pre-1967 armistice lines. Qadura Fares, president of the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society, welcomed the prisoner release as “the right decision for negotiations.” “It will only help to create an atmosphere of calm. It shows that the state of Israel really does want peace,” he said. Fares warned, however, that the prisoners must be released to their homes — that a prisoner who hails from Ramallah in the West Bank, for example, not be expelled to the Gaza Strip. The prisoners have been held since before the signing of the 1993 Oslo Accords, which created interim and limited self-government for the Palestinians and called for the Israeli military’s withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. Because the prisoners’ crimes date to the 1980s and 1990s, in an era before suicide bombing became a widespread Palestinian tactic, the attackers used molotov cocktails, knives, guns and grenades. Many of the attackers were members of Abbas’s Fatah party, and many of their targets were Israeli soldiers. The Israeli government has not provided details on who would be released and when. But according to Israeli media, Israeli victims groups and Palestinian activists, the list of prisoners to be freed might include Jumaa Adem and Mahmoud Kharbish, who threw a firebomb into a bus in the Jordan Valley in 1988, killing Rachel Weiss and her three children, as well as David Dolorosa, the Israeli soldier who tried to save them. As Netanyahu and his cabinet debated the release for more than six hours, a few hundred protesters, including relatives of those killed by the Palestinian prisoners, gathered outside the prime minister’s office during the vote and waved signs illustrated with bloody palm prints. Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, the third most powerful politician in Netanyahu’s government, briefly joined the protest and said he is against the release. “Terrorists should be eliminated, not freed,” he said, according to the Yedioth Ahronoth news Web site. Bennett called Netanyahu’s move “a mark of disgrace” and tore into the Palestinian leadership. Anyone “who demands the release of people who murdered and burned children and women is not worthy of being called a ‘partner,’ ” he said. Other members of Bennett’s Jewish Home party stood beside him and said the release was a sign of weakness, not strength, and was done to appease Washington, which they said would never stoop to releasing terrorists. “We need to act just like the United States. They have no pity for terrorists. But we are asked to be empathetic,” Meir Indor, leader of the Almagor Terror Victims Association, said in an interview. “The Americans shouldn’t ask us to do what they wouldn’t do themselves.” Yoni Chetboun, a member of parliament from Bennett’s party who was at the protest, told the Jerusalem Post, “A government that ignores its values so quickly just to enter negotiations will not think twice before uprooting settlements.” What to do about the 360,000 people living in some 150 Jewish settlements in the West Bank is one of the core issues facing negotiators. Members of Netanyahu’s party also voiced opposition. “I’m disappointed by the stance of our American allies and the West who adopt this twisted idea and see releasing murderers as something that promotes peace, and building a kindergarten as destroying peace,” Deputy Foreign Minister Zeev Elkin said in a statement. Elkin was referring to U.S. and European opposition to further construction — of schools and houses — in settlements in the West Bank.

0,"Brigitte Höss lives quietly on a leafy side street in Northern Virginia. She is retired now, having worked in a Washington fashion salon for more than 30 years. She recently was diagnosed with cancer and spends much of her days dealing with the medical consequences. Brigitte also has a secret that not even her grandchildren know. Her father was Rudolf Höss, the Kommandant of Auschwitz. It was Rudolf Höss who designed and built Auschwitz from an old army barracks in Poland to a killing machine capable of murdering 2,000 people an hour. By the end of the war, 1.1 million Jews had been killed in the camp, along with 20,000 gypsies and tens of thousands of Polish and Russian political prisoners. As such, Brigitte’s father was one of the biggest mass murderers in history. For nearly 40 years she has kept her past out of public view, unexamined, not even sharing her story with her closest family members. I discovered where she lived while doing research for “Hanns and Rudolf,” a book on how Höss was captured after the war by my great-uncle, Hanns Alexander, a German Jew who had fled Berlin in the 1930s. It took three years to find her. She would be interviewed only on the condition that neither her married name be revealed nor any details that would disclose her identity. “There are crazy people out there. They might burn my house down or shoot somebody,” she says in a thick German accent. If the subject of the Holocaust comes up, she steers the conversation in another direction. “If somebody asks about my dad,” she says, “I tell them that he died in the war.” But she has just turned 80 and wonders if it’s time to tell her grandchildren her story. She was a young girl caught in epic historic forces she could little understand, much less be responsible for. Is now the time to process her family history? Does she pass on the fear of discovery that she has lived with all her life? Or does she take her story to her grave? “It was a long time ago,” she says. “I didn’t do what was done. I never talk about it — it is something within me. It stays with me.” According to SS personnel records — held in the National Archives in College Park — Inge-Brigitt Höss was born on Aug. 18, 1933, on a farm near the Baltic Sea. Her father, Rudolf, and mother, Hedwig, met on this farm, which was a haven for German youths obsessed with ideas of racial purity and rural utopia. Brigitte was the third of five children, three girls and two boys. Brigitte had an extraordinary childhood, moving from the farm to one concentration camp after another as her father scaled the ranks of the SS: Dachau from ages 1 through 5; Sachsenhausen from 5 to 7; and from 7 to 11, in perhaps the most notorious death camp, Auschwitz. From 1940 to 1944, the Höss family lived in a two-story gray stucco villa on the edge of Auschwitz — so close you could see the prisoner blocks and old crematorium from the upstairs window. Brigitte’s mother described the place as “paradise”: They had cooks, nannies, gardeners, chauffeurs, seamstresses, haircutters and cleaners, some of whom were prisoners. The family decorated their home with furniture and artwork stolen from prisoners as they were selected for the gas chambers. It was a life of luxury taking place only a few short steps from horror and torment. Most Sundays the kommandant drove the children to see the horses in the stables. They loved to visit the kennels to pet the German shepherds. Photographs show a pond in the garden and a large table for picnics. The prisoners made giant toy airplanes for the boys, big enough for them to sit in and push around the garden. The girls liked to flirt with the handsome soldiers who guarded the camp entrance. The children were aware that their father ran a prison camp. Men with black-and-white striped uniforms worked in their garden. Once the Höss children dressed up as prisoners, pinning black triangles and yellow stars to their shirts, then chased each other until their father saw them and told them to stop the game. In April 1945, as the end of the war appeared in sight, Rudolf Höss and his family fled north. They split up. His wife took the children and found refuge above an old sugar factory in St. Michaelisdonn, a village near the coast. The kommandant took on the identity of a laborer and hid on a farm four miles from the Danish border. The Höss family waited for the right moment to escape to South America. We sit in a small, dark den to the side of her house. Brigitte lies on an old couch, complaining that her feet hurt. I sit on a plump loveseat next to a Christmas tree, upon which hangs a star knitted by her mother, Hedwig, the kommandant’s wife. I start by asking about the time she spent living next to Auschwitz. “It is best not to remember all those things,” Brigitte says. She is more willing to talk about when the British captured her father. One cold evening in March 1946, Hanns Alexander, my great-uncle — a German-born Jew but by then a British captain — banged on the family’s door. “I remember when they came to our house to ask questions,” she says, her voice tight. “I was sitting on the table with my sister. I was about 13 years old. The British soldiers were screaming: ‘Where is your father? Where is your father?’ over and over again. I got a very bad headache. I went outside and cried under a tree. I made myself calm down. I made myself stop crying, and my headache went away. But I have had migraines for years after that. These migraines stopped a few years ago, but since I received your letter, they have started again.” The story continues. “My older brother Klaus was taken with my mother. He was beaten badly by the British. My mother heard him scream in pain from the room next door. Just like any mother, she wanted to protect her son, so she told them where my father was.” Alexander assembled a team and headed to the barn in the night. Höss was awakened. He denied he was the kommandant. Certain he had his man, Alexander demanded to see his wedding ring. When Höss claimed it was stuck, Alexander threatened to cut his finger off until the kommandant passed the ring over. Inside was inscribed “Rudolf” and “Hedwig.” The kommandant was the first person at such a senior level to admit the extent of the slaughter at Auschwitz. He was handed over to the Americans, who made him testify at Nuremberg. Then Höss was passed to the Poles, who prosecuted him, then hanged him on a gallows next to the Auschwitz crematorium. Hedwig and the children scraped by. They stole coal from a train to heat their home. Shoeless, they tied rags around their feet. As a family connected to the Nazi regime, they were shunned. It was only when Klaus found a job in Stuttgart that the family’s fortunes improved. In the 1950s Brigitte managed to leave Germany and make a new life in Spain. She was a stunning young lady, with long blond hair, a slender figure and a “don’t mess with me” attitude. She worked as a model for three years with the up-and-coming Balenciaga fashion house. And she met an Irish American engineer working in Madrid for a Washington-based communications company. The couple married in 1961. They had a daughter and a son. His work took them to Liberia, then Greece, Iran and Vietnam. The engineer says Brigitte told him about her father and her life in Auschwitz while they were dating. “I was at first a little bit shocked,” he says. “But then as I discussed more and more with her, I realized that she was as much a victim as anybody else. She was just a child while this all happened. She went from having everything to having nothing.” He says they had an “unspoken and unwritten agreement” not to talk about her family background. He remembers telling her: “It was a terrible thing — let’s not carry it any further. Let’s get on with our lives, live happily and leave it all behind. It is not your responsibility. There is no reason to carry the guilt of your father.” In 1972 they moved to Washington. Brigitte’s husband took a senior job with a transportation company, and they bought a house in Georgetown. It was a chance for Brigitte to start over. Brigitte struggled — she didn’t know how to write a check, spoke little English and was without friends or family. After some searching, she found a part-time job in a fashion boutique. One day a short Jewish lady visited the boutique. She liked Brigitte’s style and asked her to come work in her fashion salon in the District. Soon after she was hired, Brigitte says, she got drunk with her manager and confessed that her father was Rudolf Höss. The manager told the store’s owner. The owner told Brigitte that she could stay, that she had not committed any crime herself. What Brigitte did not know, at least not until later, was that the store owner and her husband, the co-owner, were Jewish, and he had fled Nazi Germany after the Kristallnacht attacks of 1938. Brigitte was thankful for being seen as a person, rather than her father’s daughter. She worked at the store for 35 years, serving prominent Washingtonians, including the wives of senators and congressmen. The store owner returned Brigitte’s loyalty and hard work by keeping her secret. With the exception of one other manager, none of the other staff knew the truth about Brigitte’s family history. After Brigitte retired a few years ago, the store owner called every month to see how she was doing. “She is very nice,” Brigitte says. Then about a year ago, she stopped calling. Brigitte knew the store owner had visited Israel and wondered if she had, after all the years, become angry. “People do change,” she said. That Rudolf Höss’s daughter lives in Northern Virginia is not the only family story kept secret. Starting in the 1960s, Hedwig visited her daughter in Washington every few years. By this time, Hedwig had moved to a small house near Stuttgart, where she lived with one of her daughters. Unlike other widows of German soldiers, she was not granted a state pension, nor did she receive any other income from the government. Although Hedwig had played a prominent role in Auschwitz, even appearing as a witness at the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial in 1965, there were no travel restrictions on the spouses of Nazi war criminals. While in Washington, Hedwig spent her time watching the grandchildren while her daughter worked. They didn’t talk about the past. Hedwig’s last visit was in September 1989. She was 81 and frail. She was due to fly back to Germany but told her daughter it was too cold and she preferred to remain longer. After dinner on Sept. 15, Hedwig said she was tired and headed for bed. The next day Brigitte knocked on her mother’s door and, after no answer, went in. Hedwig had died in her sleep. Brigitte found a local crematorium to take care of the body. She didn’t want anyone to find her mother’s remains — least of all neo-Nazis who might pay homage — so she gave a modified version of her mother’s name to the cemetery administrator. She delayed the memorial service to allow family members from Germany to attend. At 11 a.m. on March 3, 1990, to coincide with her mother’s birthday, a short service was held in a small stone cloister in an interdenominational cemetery. Prayers were said, then the urn was interred. Hedwig’s final resting place was among the graves of Jews, Christians and Muslims. Brigitte’s life is now full of doctors, hospitals and pills. She and her husband divorced in 1983. He has since married twice and lives in Florida. Her son lives with her. He knows about his grandfather but has not expressed much interest in looking into his family’s history. Her daughter has died. Brigitte is visited often by her grandchildren. Once a year she flies to Florida to spend time with her sister Annegret, who flies in from Germany. Klaus died in the 1980s in Australia. Her other brother, Hans Jürgen, and elder sister, Heidetraud, both live in Germany. None of the siblings talks about their childhood — it’s as if their history started in 1947, after Rudolf Höss was executed. Brigitte’s nephew, Rainer Höss, son of Hans Jürgen, is the one family member who has asked questions about the past. In 2009 I traveled with him to Auschwitz. At one point he turned to me and said matter-of-factly, “If I knew where my grandfather was buried, I would piss on his grave.” Brigitte kept her husband’s last name after they divorced. She doesn’t talk about the past to friends, has steered clear of other German families, and doesn’t talk about her background to her family. She has not spoken to her grandchildren about her father (though her ex-husband says he has given Höss’s autobiography to the older two). She doesn’t want to “upset them,” she says, and she is worried that they might tell people, which could put the family at risk. “I am still scared here in Washington,” she says. “There are a lot Jewish people, and they still hate the Germans. It never ends.” Yet, she thinks about it, about sharing her story with her family. “I will eventually, maybe when I read your book,” she tells me. Perhaps one consequence of keeping the past so private is that it remains insufficiently examined. Brigitte tells me she has never visited the National Holocaust Museum. And while she understands the value of a museum to remind us of the horrors of the past, she says it should be in Auschwitz or Israel, not Washington. “They always make things worse than it is,” she says. “It is so awful, I can’t stand it.” She does not deny that atrocities took place or that Jews and others were murdered in the camps, but she questions that millions were killed. “How can there be so many survivors if so many had been killed?” she asks. When I point out that her father confessed to being responsible for the death of more than a million Jews, she says the British “took it out of him with torture.” “And your father, how do you remember him?” I ask. “He was the nicest man in the world,” she says. “He was very good to us.” She remembers them eating together, playing in the garden, and reading the story of Hansel and Gretel. Brigitte is convinced that her father was a sensitive man and had guessed that he was involved with something bad. “I’m sure he was sad inside,” she recalls. “It is just a feeling. The way he was at home, the way he was with us, sometimes he looked sad when he came back from work.” Brigitte struggles to reconcile her father’s dual nature. “There must have been two sides to him. The one that I knew and then another. ...” When I ask how he could be the “nicest man in the world” if he was responsible for the deaths, she says: “He had to do it. His family was threatened. We were threatened if he didn’t. And he was one of many in the SS. There were others as well who would do it if he didn’t.” After a long interview, Brigitte shows me around her house. Upstairs, she points to a photograph above her bed. It’s her mother and father’s wedding photograph, taken in 1929. They look young, happy, carefree. She in a white frock, hair tied up; he in three-quarter-length trousers and light shirt. The 80-year-old Brigitte sleeps every night under the watchful eye of her beloved father, Rudolf Höss. Sometime afterward, I call the son of the salon owner. He tells me that the reason his mother had stopped calling Brigitte was that she had simply grown too old to make the calls. “My family holds Brigitte as close as we always have,” he says. When I ask him why his parents had decided to employ her all those years ago, despite knowing that her father had been a senior member of the Nazi leadership that had driven their own family out of Germany, he told me that it was because of “humanity.” His parents had seen her as a person, in her own right, apart from her father. “The one has nothing to do with the other. She is a human being,” he says. “She was not responsible for her father.” Reflecting on his parents’ decision, he says, “I am proud to be their son.”    Thomas Harding is the author of “Hanns and Rudolf: The True Story of the German Jew Who Tracked Down and Caught the Kommandant of Auschwitz” (Simon & Schuster Hardcover; September 2013).

She is retired now, having worked in a Washington fashion salon for more than 30 years. She recently was diagnosed with cancer and spends much of her days dealing with the medical consequences. Brigitte also has a secret that not even her grandchildren know. Her father was Rudolf Höss, the Kommandant of Auschwitz. It was Rudolf Höss who designed and built Auschwitz from an old army barracks in Poland to a killing machine capable of murdering 2,000 people an hour. By the end of the war, 1.1 million Jews had been killed in the camp, along with 20,000 gypsies and tens of thousands of Polish and Russian political prisoners. As such, Brigitte’s father was one of the biggest mass murderers in history. For nearly 40 years she has kept her past out of public view, unexamined, not even sharing her story with her closest family members. I discovered where she lived while doing research for “Hanns and Rudolf,” a book on how Höss was captured after the war by my great-uncle, Hanns Alexander, a German Jew who had fled Berlin in the 1930s. It took three years to find her. She would be interviewed only on the condition that neither her married name be revealed nor any details that would disclose her identity. “There are crazy people out there. They might burn my house down or shoot somebody,” she says in a thick German accent. If the subject of the Holocaust comes up, she steers the conversation in another direction. “If somebody asks about my dad,” she says, “I tell them that he died in the war.” But she has just turned 80 and wonders if it’s time to tell her grandchildren her story. She was a young girl caught in epic historic forces she could little understand, much less be responsible for. Is now the time to process her family history? Does she pass on the fear of discovery that she has lived with all her life? Or does she take her story to her grave? “It was a long time ago,” she says. “I didn’t do what was done. I never talk about it — it is something within me. It stays with me.” According to SS personnel records — held in the National Archives in College Park — Inge-Brigitt Höss was born on Aug. 18, 1933, on a farm near the Baltic Sea. Her father, Rudolf, and mother, Hedwig, met on this farm, which was a haven for German youths obsessed with ideas of racial purity and rural utopia. Brigitte was the third of five children, three girls and two boys. Brigitte had an extraordinary childhood, moving from the farm to one concentration camp after another as her father scaled the ranks of the SS: Dachau from ages 1 through 5; Sachsenhausen from 5 to 7; and from 7 to 11, in perhaps the most notorious death camp, Auschwitz. From 1940 to 1944, the Höss family lived in a two-story gray stucco villa on the edge of Auschwitz — so close you could see the prisoner blocks and old crematorium from the upstairs window. Brigitte’s mother described the place as “paradise”: They had cooks, nannies, gardeners, chauffeurs, seamstresses, haircutters and cleaners, some of whom were prisoners. The family decorated their home with furniture and artwork stolen from prisoners as they were selected for the gas chambers. It was a life of luxury taking place only a few short steps from horror and torment. Most Sundays the kommandant drove the children to see the horses in the stables. They loved to visit the kennels to pet the German shepherds. Photographs show a pond in the garden and a large table for picnics. The prisoners made giant toy airplanes for the boys, big enough for them to sit in and push around the garden. The girls liked to flirt with the handsome soldiers who guarded the camp entrance. The children were aware that their father ran a prison camp. Men with black-and-white striped uniforms worked in their garden. Once the Höss children dressed up as prisoners, pinning black triangles and yellow stars to their shirts, then chased each other until their father saw them and told them to stop the game. In April 1945, as the end of the war appeared in sight, Rudolf Höss and his family fled north. They split up. His wife took the children and found refuge above an old sugar factory in St. Michaelisdonn, a village near the coast. The kommandant took on the identity of a laborer and hid on a farm four miles from the Danish border. The Höss family waited for the right moment to escape to South America. We sit in a small, dark den to the side of her house. Brigitte lies on an old couch, complaining that her feet hurt. I sit on a plump loveseat next to a Christmas tree, upon which hangs a star knitted by her mother, Hedwig, the kommandant’s wife. I start by asking about the time she spent living next to Auschwitz. “It is best not to remember all those things,” Brigitte says. She is more willing to talk about when the British captured her father. One cold evening in March 1946, Hanns Alexander, my great-uncle — a German-born Jew but by then a British captain — banged on the family’s door. “I remember when they came to our house to ask questions,” she says, her voice tight. “I was sitting on the table with my sister. I was about 13 years old. The British soldiers were screaming: ‘Where is your father? Where is your father?’ over and over again. I got a very bad headache. I went outside and cried under a tree. I made myself calm down. I made myself stop crying, and my headache went away. But I have had migraines for years after that. These migraines stopped a few years ago, but since I received your letter, they have started again.” The story continues. “My older brother Klaus was taken with my mother. He was beaten badly by the British. My mother heard him scream in pain from the room next door. Just like any mother, she wanted to protect her son, so she told them where my father was.” Alexander assembled a team and headed to the barn in the night. Höss was awakened. He denied he was the kommandant. Certain he had his man, Alexander demanded to see his wedding ring. When Höss claimed it was stuck, Alexander threatened to cut his finger off until the kommandant passed the ring over. Inside was inscribed “Rudolf” and “Hedwig.” The kommandant was the first person at such a senior level to admit the extent of the slaughter at Auschwitz. He was handed over to the Americans, who made him testify at Nuremberg. Then Höss was passed to the Poles, who prosecuted him, then hanged him on a gallows next to the Auschwitz crematorium. Hedwig and the children scraped by. They stole coal from a train to heat their home. Shoeless, they tied rags around their feet. As a family connected to the Nazi regime, they were shunned. It was only when Klaus found a job in Stuttgart that the family’s fortunes improved. In the 1950s Brigitte managed to leave Germany and make a new life in Spain. She was a stunning young lady, with long blond hair, a slender figure and a “don’t mess with me” attitude. She worked as a model for three years with the up-and-coming Balenciaga fashion house. And she met an Irish American engineer working in Madrid for a Washington-based communications company. The couple married in 1961. They had a daughter and a son. His work took them to Liberia, then Greece, Iran and Vietnam. The engineer says Brigitte told him about her father and her life in Auschwitz while they were dating. “I was at first a little bit shocked,” he says. “But then as I discussed more and more with her, I realized that she was as much a victim as anybody else. She was just a child while this all happened. She went from having everything to having nothing.” He says they had an “unspoken and unwritten agreement” not to talk about her family background. He remembers telling her: “It was a terrible thing — let’s not carry it any further. Let’s get on with our lives, live happily and leave it all behind. It is not your responsibility. There is no reason to carry the guilt of your father.” In 1972 they moved to Washington. Brigitte’s husband took a senior job with a transportation company, and they bought a house in Georgetown. It was a chance for Brigitte to start over. Brigitte struggled — she didn’t know how to write a check, spoke little English and was without friends or family. After some searching, she found a part-time job in a fashion boutique. One day a short Jewish lady visited the boutique. She liked Brigitte’s style and asked her to come work in her fashion salon in the District. Soon after she was hired, Brigitte says, she got drunk with her manager and confessed that her father was Rudolf Höss. The manager told the store’s owner. The owner told Brigitte that she could stay, that she had not committed any crime herself. What Brigitte did not know, at least not until later, was that the store owner and her husband, the co-owner, were Jewish, and he had fled Nazi Germany after the Kristallnacht attacks of 1938. Brigitte was thankful for being seen as a person, rather than her father’s daughter. She worked at the store for 35 years, serving prominent Washingtonians, including the wives of senators and congressmen. The store owner returned Brigitte’s loyalty and hard work by keeping her secret. With the exception of one other manager, none of the other staff knew the truth about Brigitte’s family history. After Brigitte retired a few years ago, the store owner called every month to see how she was doing. “She is very nice,” Brigitte says. Then about a year ago, she stopped calling. Brigitte knew the store owner had visited Israel and wondered if she had, after all the years, become angry. “People do change,” she said. That Rudolf Höss’s daughter lives in Northern Virginia is not the only family story kept secret. Starting in the 1960s, Hedwig visited her daughter in Washington every few years. By this time, Hedwig had moved to a small house near Stuttgart, where she lived with one of her daughters. Unlike other widows of German soldiers, she was not granted a state pension, nor did she receive any other income from the government. Although Hedwig had played a prominent role in Auschwitz, even appearing as a witness at the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial in 1965, there were no travel restrictions on the spouses of Nazi war criminals. While in Washington, Hedwig spent her time watching the grandchildren while her daughter worked. They didn’t talk about the past. Hedwig’s last visit was in September 1989. She was 81 and frail. She was due to fly back to Germany but told her daughter it was too cold and she preferred to remain longer. After dinner on Sept. 15, Hedwig said she was tired and headed for bed. The next day Brigitte knocked on her mother’s door and, after no answer, went in. Hedwig had died in her sleep. Brigitte found a local crematorium to take care of the body. She didn’t want anyone to find her mother’s remains — least of all neo-Nazis who might pay homage — so she gave a modified version of her mother’s name to the cemetery administrator. She delayed the memorial service to allow family members from Germany to attend. At 11 a.m. on March 3, 1990, to coincide with her mother’s birthday, a short service was held in a small stone cloister in an interdenominational cemetery. Prayers were said, then the urn was interred. Hedwig’s final resting place was among the graves of Jews, Christians and Muslims. Brigitte’s life is now full of doctors, hospitals and pills. She and her husband divorced in 1983. He has since married twice and lives in Florida. Her son lives with her. He knows about his grandfather but has not expressed much interest in looking into his family’s history. Her daughter has died. Brigitte is visited often by her grandchildren. Once a year she flies to Florida to spend time with her sister Annegret, who flies in from Germany. Klaus died in the 1980s in Australia. Her other brother, Hans Jürgen, and elder sister, Heidetraud, both live in Germany. None of the siblings talks about their childhood — it’s as if their history started in 1947, after Rudolf Höss was executed. Brigitte’s nephew, Rainer Höss, son of Hans Jürgen, is the one family member who has asked questions about the past. In 2009 I traveled with him to Auschwitz. At one point he turned to me and said matter-of-factly, “If I knew where my grandfather was buried, I would piss on his grave.” Brigitte kept her husband’s last name after they divorced. She doesn’t talk about the past to friends, has steered clear of other German families, and doesn’t talk about her background to her family. She has not spoken to her grandchildren about her father (though her ex-husband says he has given Höss’s autobiography to the older two). She doesn’t want to “upset them,” she says, and she is worried that they might tell people, which could put the family at risk. “I am still scared here in Washington,” she says. “There are a lot Jewish people, and they still hate the Germans. It never ends.” Yet, she thinks about it, about sharing her story with her family. “I will eventually, maybe when I read your book,” she tells me. Perhaps one consequence of keeping the past so private is that it remains insufficiently examined. Brigitte tells me she has never visited the National Holocaust Museum. And while she understands the value of a museum to remind us of the horrors of the past, she says it should be in Auschwitz or Israel, not Washington. “They always make things worse than it is,” she says. “It is so awful, I can’t stand it.” She does not deny that atrocities took place or that Jews and others were murdered in the camps, but she questions that millions were killed. “How can there be so many survivors if so many had been killed?” she asks.

0,"BRASILIA — Secretary of State John F. Kerry indicated Tuesday that West Bank construction plans announced by Israel this week do not violate agreements made before the launch of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and said he expects the two sides to meet Wednesday as scheduled. When the U.S.-orchestrated talks were agreed to last month, Kerry said, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “was completely upfront with me and with [Palestinian Authority] President [Mahmoud] Abbas that he would be announcing some additional building that would take place in places that will not affect the peace map, that will not have any impact on the capacity to have a peace agreement.” Kerry, after a 30-minute phone conversation with Netanyahu, said he had reminded the Israeli leader of U.S. policy that “all settlements . . . are illegitimate.” “He has specifically agreed not to disturb what might be the potential for peace going forward,” Kerry said. After investing months and considerable prestige in arranging the talks, Kerry seemed to be bending over backward to ensure that the initial round begins as scheduled in Jerusalem. “There are realities within life in Israel that also have to be taken into account,” he said, apparently referring to strong opposition to peace negotiations within Netanyahu’s shaky political coalition. “Abbas understood that coming into these talks.” Although some Palestinian leaders have urged Abbas to cancel the Wednesday session between high-level negotiators, Kerry said that “he is committed to continue to come to this negotiation.” Kerry said he expected to speak directly to Abbas later Tuesday. The issue of Israel’s West Bank settlements has interfered with a number of previous peace efforts, with new construction announcements frequently coming on the eve of talks. Kerry has pressed both sides to avoid provocative steps and to concentrate on the final status of borders, with a nine-month deadline to reach agreement. “If you resolve the borders,” he said Tuesday, “you have resolved any questions about settlements, because then you know what is in Israel and what is not.” Since Sunday, after earlier agreeing at Kerry’s urging to release 104 longtime Palestinian prisoners, Israel has announced plans for up to 3,000 new housing units on the West Bank. Some of the plans, with only preliminary local approval, are a long way from construction. Others are projects that the government approved before the current round of peace talks were arranged. In both cases, the United States has concluded that Netanyahu has not violated his agreement with Kerry and the Palestinians. Late Tuesday, Israeli authorities put 26 Palestinian prisoners on windowless buses to be delivered to their homes and supporters in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Arrested between 1985 and 2001, all were serving long sentences for murdering or attempting to kill Israeli citizens, tourists, security guards and suspected Palestinian collaborators. In the West Bank Palestinian village of Azmout, the parents of Mohammed Sawalha were dressed in white wedding finery, anticipating the release of their son and his cousin Hosni, who were both 17 when they carried out a lethal knife attack on an Israeli bus in 1990. Hassam Sawalha, a brother of Hosni, expressed sympathy for the victim’s family but said the two prisoners had spent 23 years in jail in punishment for a crime committed before the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. “These boys were defending our land and our dignity. Palestinians were also being killed left and right. Do the Israelis feel sorry for us?” he said. Families of Israeli victims have said this is no way to begin a peace process — by releasing people they call terrorists and killers. Despite the releases, however, many Palestinian leaders, and many Israelis who support the talks, see the settlement announcements as timed to torpedo the negotiations before they begin. A Tuesday editorial in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz said that Netanyahu “pushes the envelope of Palestinian understanding” and that the announced approvals “seem to represent the hope for a targeted assassination of the opening of the peace talks after every other effort to stop them has failed.” The new Middle East problems came as Kerry confronted a separate challenge during a two-day visit to South America. In a joint news conference here, Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota said that if questions about the interception of Brazilian electronic and telephone communications by the U.S. National Security Agency are not resolved, “we run the risk of casting a shadow of distrust” over the wide range of bilateral issues with the United States. Revelations that South American countries were targets of NSA surveillance disclosed by former agency contractor Edward Snowden have particularly angered Brazil, which has called for a U.N. investigation. “We need to discontinue practices” that violate sovereignty and individual freedoms, Patriota said in the news conference with Kerry. Kerry, who faced similar, if less strident, questions during a stop in Colombia on Monday, was asked point-blank by a reporter from the Brazilian newspaperO Globo whether the United States intends to “stop spying” on the rest of the world. The paper published the initial revelations of surveillance in South America last month. Saying that Brazil was “owed answers,” Kerry repeated President Obama’s insistence in Washington last week that the surveillance program is a valuable counter­terrorism tool, conducted legally with congressional and judicial approval and oversight. Kerry promised a continuing dialogue “with a view to making certain that your government is in complete understanding and complete agreement with what it is that we think we must do to provide security not just for Americans, but for Brazilians” and others, and he appealed to Brazilians to stay focused on “the important realities of our relationship.” Both Kerry and Patriota praised the strong U.S.-Brazilian trade and investment ties, as well as the two countries’ shared commitment to democracy, the environment and educational and tourist exchanges. Kerry lauded Brazil’s participation in international peace-making. Although Brazil’s ire over the surveillance is considerable — and President Dilma Rousseff probably welcomes a distraction from domestic economic and political pressures — neither country wants to set a negative tone for her scheduled trip to Washington in October. She is the only state leader Obama will host this year. William Booth in Jerusalem and Sufian Taha in Azmout, West Bank, contributed to this report.","BRASILIA — Secretary of State John F.

0,"TEHRAN — Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, delivered a lengthy, sweeping speech at the country’s holiest site Thursday in which he suggested that he is open to nuclear talks, if not optimistic about their outcome. A day after Iran celebrated its new year, Khamenei, speaking at the shrine of Imam Reza in Mashhad, the country’s second-largest city and his home town, covered a range of issues he deemed essential for Iran to address in the coming year, including the effect of sanctions, the country’s over-reliance on oil revenue, the possibility of negotiations with the United States and the upcoming Iranian presidential election. In his remarks, which were broadcast live on state television, Khamenei also issued a warning to Israel’s leaders. “At times, the officials of the Zionist regime threaten to launch a military invasion,” he said. “But they themselves know that if they make the slightest mistake, the Islamic republic will raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground.” Alluding to U.S.-led economic sanctions on Iran, Khamenei said that “the enemies’ efforts to isolate us have failed completely,” though he acknowledged that sanctions targeting the country’s vital oil sector and its ability to conduct international bank transactions have done harm. Despite his defiant tone, Khamenei hinted at a possible break in Iran’s diplomatic impasse with the United States and other Western powers over his country’s refusal to halt its uranium-enrichment activities. “I am not optimistic about talks with the U.S., but I’m not opposed to them, either,” Khamenei said, but he added that the United States must prove that negotiations are not simply “a tactic designed to deceive public opinion.” He also said that, in his opinion, the United States “doesn’t want the nuclear conflict to end.” “If they want it to end, the solution is easy and within reach,” he said, adding that Iran had followed the rules laid out by the International Atomic Energy Agency and would continue to do so. Khamenei spent the final portion of the nearly 90-minute-long speech discussing the importance of the presidential vote, scheduled for June. “All political groups that believe in the Islamic republic must take part,” he said. Although Khamenei was previously supportive of outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a political rift has developed between them over the past two years, with Ahmadinejad at times publicly defying the more powerful Khamenei. In a jab at Ahmadinejad, Khamenei said, “The next president must have all the strong points of the current president without any of his weaknesses.”","TEHRAN — Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, delivered a lengthy, sweeping speech at the country’s holiest site Thursday in which he suggested that he is open to nuclear talks, if not optimistic about their outcome.

TEHRAN — Iran is about to step into a critical period, facing colliding challenges that are among the most significant since the country became an Islamic republic in 1979. Since mid-March, most Iranians have been on vacation connected to Nowruz, the Persian New Year, leaving Iran’s chaotic capital unusually calm. All that will change on Saturday, when workers return to their jobs amid economic and political concerns. With negotiations underway over Iran’s nuclear program, and with the start of an extraordinarily unpredictable Iranian presidential campaign, the weeks ahead could prove pivotal in determining whether Iran moves toward an easing in tensions with the West or further isolation. Much will depend on who wins the June 14 presidential election, which will end Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s controversial tenure as chief executive. Any nuclear deal would be unlikely until after Iran has chosen its next president. Although official campaigning will not begin until early May, there are 20 candidates who have announced their intentions to run, and all indications are that the election season will be a volatile one. Besides a growing list of conservative political figures, possible candidates include two former presidents, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami, both of whom are considered to be reformists within the clerical establishment. Like Ahmadinejad, both are viewed with suspicion by clerics who see them as a threat to their continued dominance in politics. Although Khatami is the most recognizable member of the reformist camp, some analysts believe he is unlikely to expose himself to the risks of a political campaign after a disappointing end to his two-term presidency, which ended in 2005. Ahmadinejad, meanwhile, is acting like a man who intends to maintain a strong role in Iranian politics even after he leaves office, lobbying hard for his top adviser, former chief of staff Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, to succeed him. It is unclear whether the 12-member Guardian Council, a conservative-dominated body that is tasked with vetting presidential candidates, would allow a reformist, or even Mashaei, to run. The presidencies of Rafsanjani and Khatami both saw Iran move away from the anti-Western ideology that had been central to Iran’s identity since the toppling of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979. But the prospect of a wider field of candidates has enlivened a race that most observers had thought would include only conservatives closely aligned with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “What seems to be happening in the run-up to the elections is the shifting of alliances and enmities on an immense scale between a wide range of the political elite — far wider than was predicted by Western analysts even three months ago,” said Kevan Harris, a Princeton University sociologist who conducts research on Iran’s economy and travels regularly to the country. Whoever wins will inherit a series of challenges and opportunities that no previous Iranian president has faced. On Monday, the Iranian government released monthly economic statistics that showed the official rate of inflation rising for the sixth consecutive month, to 31.5 percent. Some analysts believe the rate to be even higher. Leading up to the New Year’s holiday, Iran’s central bank made one-time deposits of about $20 each into the accounts of more than 70 million Iranian citizens to help cover holiday expenses. The amount was nearly double the normal monthly cash handout that the state has been paying to citizens to offset a reduction in long-standing utility subsidies. While there were not many who rejected the cash infusion, concerns that such freewheeling spending policies will actually increase inflation are growing among residents who already are restless over rising prices and their diminished purchasing power. “I’m not an economist,” said Nazila, a 53-year old housewife in Tehran, “but what difference does this money make if the prices of food just keep going higher?” Like most Iranians who give interviews, she declined to give her last name, fearing government reprisal for speaking to foreign media. A main reason for the price hikes is the sagging value of the Iranian rial against foreign currencies, a problem compounded by Tehran’s heavy reliance on imports. The decline is also a product of the international sanctions imposed on Iran over the country’s nuclear program.

0," TEHRAN — The interim deal struck last month between Iran and world powers over the Islamic republic’s contested nuclear activities should brighten prospects for the business community here, but so far entrepreneurs say they’ve seen little sign of economic improvement, although they remain hopeful. Merchants in Tehran are struggling from a series of interconnected financial problems that threaten the survival of many businesses. But although Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s cautiously optimistic economic outlook is buoying the mood, it’s also increasing expectations. The current Iranian year is proving to be the most economically trying one since Iran’s eight-year war with Iran ended in 1988, with economic growth at a reported negative-5.8 percent and an inflation rate of 40 percent. The nation is also struggling with joblessness, with a unemployment at 12.4 percent. Though Rouhani’s budget plan for the coming year does not forecast much improvement in the jobs market, the president has indicated that job creation is a priority. But he has also acknowledged that inflation is a challenge that he must address immediately. His proposed budget, which he submitted to parliament Sunday, predicts a big jump in economic growth — rising to a rate of 3 percent — and a big drop in inflation — falling to 25 percent — in the next Iranian calendar year, which begins March 21. Whether Iran can achieve the projected rebounds will depend on its ability to sell oil at current rates and to access foreign currency, and that assumes a lasting nuclear accord that would ease the sanctions on Iran’s battered economy. The six-month interim nuclear deal, which will go into effect Jan. 15 and expire in July, will make about $7 billion of Iran’s own currency available to the Islamic republic — a small fraction of the country’s assets that are currently frozen abroad. But even modest economic improvement and the reversal of years of punitive measures taken against Tehran by other nations will likely open up political space for Rouhani to broker a more lasting nuclear agreement. Analysts here are mixed in their assessment of Rouhani’s progress report and how he plans to heal Iran’s ailing economy. But they tend to agree that Rouhani is likely to use more experienced managers and craft a sounder economic policy than his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is widely blamed for Iran’s current woes. “Three percent growth by next year will be difficult to reach, but I believe that Rouhani’s foreign policy outreach can definitely impact economic programs in positive ways,” said economic analyst Seyed Hossein Ghasemi, who warned that any positive economic trends being seen so far were purely “psychological.” The proposed budget, which earmarks more funds for the private sector, promises to “create more opportunities for businesses, factories, construction and agriculture,” said economist Saeed Laylaz. “And it also means more domestic products and more people employed to do these jobs.”  Retail businesses with high inventory turnover, including food vendors, are among the few industries already reporting a better situation since Rouhani’s inauguration. They attribute their success to reduced volatility in the value of Iran’s currency, the rial, after two years of fluctuations that destabilized the price of many imported products.   The cost of chicken, for example, doubled in a matter of days in 2012, but such uncertainty in food prices no longer hinders sellers. “In the past, we were not sure whether to buy a certain item or not, but now as the prices are almost fixed and we don’t expect any increases, we order from suppliers with peace of mind,” said Ali Aghaie, a manager of a supermarket in central Tehran. But other key sectors, including Iran’s once-booming real estate market, continue to struggle. On Sunday a spokesman for Iran’s real estate agents’ union said that the number of daily real estate transactions since Rouhani took office has more than doubled. Realtors here, however, report the opposite. “There hasn’t been any tangible improvement in the market,” said Parviz Mahdani, a realtor on Tehran’s main thoroughfare, Valiasr Street. “Real estate already had its growth in terms of investment, and even those who were reliable land developers are now investing in the stock market instead.” The slowdown in real estate sales is affecting other sectors, including home furnishings. “All my materials are imported, and because the exchange of the dollar was so high last year, we were forced to raise prices,” complained Hossein Moshfegh, who manages his family’s wood composite business. “But our costs haven’t come down, even though the value of the dollar is 20 percent less than it was when Rouhani took office.” Domestically produced goods, meanwhile, face hurdles such as trade embargoes and even image problems in reaching foreign consumers. “We’re all just trying to survive this period,” Hossein Hosseiny, a rug merchant in Tehran’s bazaar, said. “The rug business has everything to do with our relationship with the world. It’s completely psychological, and if people have a good view of Iran, our rugs will sell.”  One bright spot: Internet-based businesses and pioneers of Iran’s e-commerce sector are reporting major gains despite continued problems with Internet connectivity and sanctions that block consumers from making international online transactions. As the number of Iranians using the Internet grows by the day, so, too, does online shopping. And while other domestic industries may take years to rebound, e-commerce is set to take off, Internet retailers say. “The government can play a vital role in creating an ecosystem of bringing in foreign investors and giving incentives for people to stay in the industry and encourage others to enter it. There’s a huge potential, and our industry will create a lot of jobs,” Ehsan Golabgir, chief executive of Albasco.com, one of Iran’s most visited online stores, said."," TEHRAN — The interim deal struck last month between Iran and world powers over the Islamic republic’s contested nuclear activities should brighten prospects for the business community here, but so far entrepreneurs say they’ve seen little sign of economic improvement, although they remain hopeful.

0,"JERUSALEM — The Israeli government Monday night released another 26 Palestinian prisoners serving long sentences for killing Israeli citizens, part of a deal struck between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry to bring Palestinian leaders back to peace negotiations. It is the third of four scheduled releases for a total of 104 Palestinian prisoners, all serving 19 years or more in Israeli jails for crimes committed before the 1993 signing of the Oslo accords. For Israelis, each release appears more difficult than the last. A few hundred people have been staging an emotional protest in front of Netanyahu’s official residence for the past three days, waving signs depicting bloody hands, as others gathered Monday night outside a prisoner’s home in East Jerusalem. Among the demonstrators at Netanyahu’s house was Elihai Ben Ishai, whose sister, her husband and their three children were killed in their sleep in the Jewish settlement of Itamar in the West Bank in 2011. “The U.S. government would not release convicted murderers, so why is it pressuring Israel to release terrorists and murderers?” Ben Ishai said. In Ramallah, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was ready, for the third time, to welcome home prisoners  who are seen as heroes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because their attacks on Jewish Israelis were motivated by resistance to the Israeli occupation. “They will participate in a special torch-lighting to celebrate the beginning of the new year,” Palestinian Minister of Prisoner Affairs Issa Karak said in an interview. “We are very happy for the release of our prisoners, who have spent 20 years in jail, and see this as a step towards freedom for all our prisoners.” Among those released Monday night were three men convicted of slitting the throat of Sara Sharon , an Israeli prostitute and mother of seven, and leaving a note warning that they would continue to kill Jews until all Palestinian refugees came home. Also set free were Muammar Ata Mahmoud Mahmoud and Salah Khalil Ahmad Ibrahim, convicted of stabbing to death an Israel Prize-winning history professor, Menahem Stern, as he strolled the Hebrew University campus in June 1989. Qadura Fares, president of the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society, said that Israel was not doing the Palestinians any favors and that all these prisoners should have been freed as part of the Oslo accords, an agreement to establish a measure of Palestinian self-rule and partial Israeli troop withdrawal. Fares said he was happy about Monday’s release, saying it gives a “ray of hope for the release of all other prisoners.” There are about 4,700 Palestinian security prisoners  in Israeli jails, most convicted in Israeli military courts of participating in or planning terror attacks. Meir Indor, head of the Israeli victims association Almagor, said that among the 26 Palestinians released Monday, six hold Israeli identification cards and live in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as the capital of a future state and which most Israelis insist will never be divided from the rest of Jerusalem. “Where is the justice in this?” Indor said. “At the graves of each of these victims, the government promised on the one hand that Israel would provide justice, but then with the other hand they destroy that justice by releasing convicted terrorists and murderers.” Sufian Taha contributed to this report.","JERUSALEM — The Israeli government Monday night released another 26 Palestinian prisoners serving long sentences for killing Israeli citizens, part of a deal struck between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State John F.

0,"TEHRAN — Iran suspended its most sensitive nuclear development work Monday and world powers immediately responded by lifting some of the sanctions that have crippled the oil-based economy — a first cautious step toward making good on a deal aimed at resolving a decade-long standoff over Iran’s nuclear program. The reciprocal steps honor a plan to gradually ease restrictions on Iran as it adheres to new commitments to curb its program and allow greatly expanded international inspection and monitoring of the program that it insists is not intended to produce nuclear weapons. The United States, a chief skeptic of Iran’s claims and long the main international driver for tough sanctions on Iran, reacted with both praise and skepticism, saying it was an “important step forward” but also warning that the restrictions would be quickly reinstated if Iran reneges on its efforts. The United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency on Monday said Tehran has stopped enriching uranium beyond a 5 percent potency level and disabled connections between centrifuges that had been producing 20 percent-enriched uranium. Iran has also begun diluting half its stockpile of that higher-level uranium, which is considered within striking distance of bomb-quality fuel. The announcement in Tehran met a Jan. 20 deadline for the move, which is intended to lay groundwork for a broader accord on Iran’s nuclear activities. The European Union said it was responding with a release of some sanctions as part of “a six-month phase of initial confidence-building measures aimed at addressing international concerns about Iran’s nuclear activities.” The decision, which was made by European foreign ministers at a meeting in Brussels, was expected to allow Iran to resume critical exports of oil and gas. “This is an important day in our pursuit of ensuring that Iran has an exclusively peaceful nuclear program,” E.U. foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton told reporters. The White House issued a more reserved statement. “In reciprocation for Iran’s concrete actions,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement, world powers would “today follow through on our commitment to begin to provide the modest relief agreed to with Iran. At the same time, we will continue our aggressive enforcement of the sanctions measures that will remain in place throughout this six-month period.” Through its skepticism, the Obama administration is trying to address a chorus of critics at home and in Israel who say the deal is too generous as it combats efforts in Congress to create new sanctions, while the United States and other Western powers try to reach a long-term deal with Iran. Iran would receive about $4.2 billion in sanctions relief over the six-month period to reach a final deal, plus perhaps $2 billion in associated trade, U.S. officials said. Senior Obama administration officials have called the relief a “drop in the bucket” compared with the billions of oil revenue that the global sanctions on Iran have left tied up in international banks. “Iran is not truly open for business,” one U.S. official said, noting that remaining oil sanctions will cost Iran about $30 billion over the same period. Under the sanctions, most of Iran’s legitimate oil trade was suspended over the past two years. European and other corporations are widely reported to be seeking ways to resume business with Iran soon, leaving U.S. officials trying to stand in the breach. U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the technical agreement and the closed-door negotiations with Iran, also addressed the fraught politics of the Iran deal in the United States, where a bipartisan and nearly veto-proof majority of senators is on record supporting new sanctions on Iran. The administration opposes new sanctions as a violation of its careful agreement with Iran and other world powers and warns that Iran may walk away if Congress won’t back down. “The steps that we are taking today shows that we are on track toward implementing this arrangement which gives us what we need, which is halting for the first time in more than a decade Iran’s progress toward nuclear weapons capability,” one official said. “It just seems all the more clear to us that we should test the proposition that moving forward with this will give us in the end what we need, which is a comprehensive solution” that assures Iran cannot build a weapon, the official said. The nuclear talks are separate from other U.S. and world political disputes with Iran, including whether Iran participates in upcoming peace talks on the Syrian civil war, the official said. The United Nations on Monday rescinded an invitation to Iran to attend the talks because Iran would not endorse a transition from the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Tehran. In Iran, there was mixed reaction to the halting of the uranium enrichment at nuclear plants in the cities of Natanz and Fordo. Iranian opponents of the deal stepped up their denunciations of what they are calling their country’s capitulation to Western demands. Vatan-e Emrooz, a newspaper closely associated with conservatives, printed Monday’s edition in all-black type and dedicated it to coverage of what it called Iran’s “nuclear holocaust.” “What we have given up is not only incomparable with what we have received, but much less significant than can be called a win-win situation,” wrote Hossein Shariatmadari, the editor in chief of Kayhan, a newspaper often referred to as the mouthpiece for the most conservative members of Iran’s political establishment. Criticism of the deal was not unexpected, but opponents of Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, and his administration’s nuclear outreach had been uncharacteristically quiet until now. Ahmad Tavakoli, a prominent conservative member of parliament, told fellow lawmakers Monday that there were two main problems with the nuclear deal. “First of all, there are so many discrepancies in the text of the agreement that we can hardly be hopeful that our national interests will ever materialize. Second, as officials, we must not reveal our weak points in a way that our enemies can exploit them,” Tavakoli said. Despite the intensified conservative backlash, the agreement is supported by many key Iranian political figures, as well as many ordinary Iranians who hope that an easing of sanctions will ease economic woes that have reached deep into the Iranian middle class. Early indications show that Iran’s financial markets are responding well to the deal’s implementation as the Iranian currency, the rial, strengthened by more than 2 percent against the dollar Monday.

The reciprocal steps honor a plan to gradually ease restrictions on Iran as it adheres to new commitments to curb its program and allow greatly expanded international inspection and monitoring of the program that it insists is not intended to produce nuclear weapons. The United States, a chief skeptic of Iran’s claims and long the main international driver for tough sanctions on Iran, reacted with both praise and skepticism, saying it was an “important step forward” but also warning that the restrictions would be quickly reinstated if Iran reneges on its efforts. The United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency on Monday said Tehran has stopped enriching uranium beyond a 5 percent potency level and disabled connections between centrifuges that had been producing 20 percent-enriched uranium. Iran has also begun diluting half its stockpile of that higher-level uranium, which is considered within striking distance of bomb-quality fuel. The announcement in Tehran met a Jan. 20 deadline for the move, which is intended to lay groundwork for a broader accord on Iran’s nuclear activities. The European Union said it was responding with a release of some sanctions as part of “a six-month phase of initial confidence-building measures aimed at addressing international concerns about Iran’s nuclear activities.” The decision, which was made by European foreign ministers at a meeting in Brussels, was expected to allow Iran to resume critical exports of oil and gas. “This is an important day in our pursuit of ensuring that Iran has an exclusively peaceful nuclear program,” E.U. foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton told reporters. The White House issued a more reserved statement. “In reciprocation for Iran’s concrete actions,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement, world powers would “today follow through on our commitment to begin to provide the modest relief agreed to with Iran. At the same time, we will continue our aggressive enforcement of the sanctions measures that will remain in place throughout this six-month period.” Through its skepticism, the Obama administration is trying to address a chorus of critics at home and in Israel who say the deal is too generous as it combats efforts in Congress to create new sanctions, while the United States and other Western powers try to reach a long-term deal with Iran. Iran would receive about $4.2 billion in sanctions relief over the six-month period to reach a final deal, plus perhaps $2 billion in associated trade, U.S. officials said. Senior Obama administration officials have called the relief a “drop in the bucket” compared with the billions of oil revenue that the global sanctions on Iran have left tied up in international banks. “Iran is not truly open for business,” one U.S. official said, noting that remaining oil sanctions will cost Iran about $30 billion over the same period. Under the sanctions, most of Iran’s legitimate oil trade was suspended over the past two years. European and other corporations are widely reported to be seeking ways to resume business with Iran soon, leaving U.S. officials trying to stand in the breach.

0,"DAVOS, Switzerland — Iran’s president said Thursday that his country has a “serious will” to reach a deal that resolves international doubts about its nuclear program but will not give up what he called peaceful technology or consent to rules that treat Iran differently than other nations with nuclear know-how. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos as Iran enters six months of intensive talks with world powers over the bounds of a program that the United States, Israel and other nations suspect is aimed at building a nuclear bomb. His speech and a round of media interviews here continue a remarkable revamp of Iran’s image abroad, led by the smiling multilingual cleric who on Thursday called his political philosophy “prudent moderation.” “We are ready” to make a deal, Rouhani said. “Of course, this is a long and winding and difficult road. However, if we remain serious and keep the will, we can push through.” The words echo the cautious tone of both President Obama — who gave a deal a 50-50 chance of success last month — and Secretary of State John F. Kerry. Rouhani’s statements about Iran’s nuclear ambitions were also familiar. “I strongly and clearly declare that nuclear weapons have no place in our security strategy and that Iran has no motivation to move in that direction,” Rouhani said in a brief address that was followed by questions from a moderator. Rouhani would not be specific about whether he would make any outreach to Israel and was vague about what Iran might do to help resolve the civil war in Syria. Iran’s exclusion from the convening of United Nations-backed peace talks on Syria this week briefly shifted world attention away from the long-running nuclear dispute. The United States had opposed Iran’s inclusion in the Syria talks and accuses Iran of prolonging the war. But it was clear this week that the finger-pointing was a sideshow to the nuclear negotiations that both nations see as the highest foreign policy priority. Iran struck an interim bargain with world powers that eases some sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. A six-month deadline to reach a final deal began this month. The temporary deal does not guarantee that Iran can never build a weapon. Kerry appeared to acknowledge as much Thursday when he told an interviewer that Iran could subvert negotiations by making a drive for a weapon — just the scenario Israel warns of. But Kerry added a warning of his own. “If they do this, the military option is ready,” Kerry told al-Arabiya television, referring to U.S. capability to strike Iranian nuclear facilities if need be. Kerry addresses the Davos meeting Friday afternoon. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said no meeting is planned between Kerry and Rouhani or other members of his delegation. Rouhani was elected with a mandate to try to strike a deal that could lift crushing economic sanctions imposed because of the country’s disputed nuclear program. The kinder, gentler face Rouhani presents appears part of an effort to explain the Iranian position more widely and win support for what he calls a pragmatic approach to resolving international doubts about the program. Rouhani’s English-language Twitter account has been a key tool in the international charm offensive. But Iran’s tweeting, status-updating president also had some perhaps unwelcome news for his growing digital audience: He doesn’t write his own stuff. Rouhani told journalists later Thursday that his frequent online postings are “written by my friends.” Many Rouhani postings on Twitter and Facebook are upbeat distillations of Iranian foreign policy clearly made for an overseas audience. His tweet wishing Jews a happy Rosh Hashanah made news last year, since it marked a U-turn from the derogatory remarks about Jews from Rouhani’s predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Rouhani pledged “constructive engagement” with Iran’s neighbors, a gesture of political outreach for a Middle East nation that officially considers Israel illegitimate and whose ambitions and influence have made many Arab neighbors nervous. Rouhani’s main audience, however, seemed to be the throngs of top business executives who come to this Alpine gabfest. Iran could become one of the world’s 10 largest economies over the next 30 years, Rouhani said. Iran is seeking an end to crushing economic sanctions that have drastically reduced its oil exports and cut off its access to much of the global financial system. Most of the sanctions will remain in place during negotiations on a final deal to curb the Iranian nuclear program. Rouhani’s theme that Iran is “open for business” may be jumping the gun a bit, because U.S. officials estimate that existing sanctions will cost Iran $30 billion just in the six-month time frame for talks. But the prospect of the freer flow of Iranian oil and cash is already yielding potential business deals. When the initial nuclear deal was announced in November, a parade of mostly European foreign investors began to trickle back into Tehran after years away, and the number of official and unofficial trade delegations continues to grow. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not wait for his own address to the Davos forum Thursday to denounce Rouhani’s remarks as opportunistic. “The goal of the Iranian ayatollahs’ regime, which is hiding behind Rouhani’s smiles, is to ease sanctions without conceding on their program to produce nuclear weapons,” Netanyahu said in remarks distributed by his office.

0,"TEHRAN — As the Iranian year draws to a close, leaders here are attempting to manage the expectations of a public that has seen few signs of the economic improvement promised by President Hassan Rouhani when he took office in August. Despite some progress toward a lasting nuclear deal that could potentially end years of crushing sanctions, fiscal growth has been slow, and many here worry that the incoming year — 1393 on the Iranian calendar — will bring even leaner times. “The Rouhani government is under a lot of domestic and international pressure, and considering the limited resources and authority his administration has, we cannot expect much from them,” said Hassan Sanati, a manager in a Tehran housing agency. While currency rates have stabilized at more than 10 percent above where they were when Rouhani was elected in June, little has changed for most Iranians, who are struggling to make ends meet. Nowruz, the Iranian New Year that begins Friday, is celebrated at the beginning of spring. It predates Islam by many centuries but continues to be an important part of Iranian identity and constitutes the main holiday season in Iran. Following the start of the new year and the Nowruz holiday vacation, ­prices are typically set on a range of goods and utilities, and the annual budget is implemented. In recent years, it has often meant sharp price in­creases for gasoline and other sources of energy. In its annual report, the Ministry of Economics and Finance said Iran is still suffering from high inflation and deep stagnation, which has led to negative growth of more than 5 percent in the past year. The continued bad news has prompted Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to ask Iranians to embrace what he calls a “resistance economy,” which means more reliance on domestic production and less rampant consumption of imports. The resistance economy “is a long-term solution for the country’s economy and for achieving the lofty economic goals of the Islamic establishment,” Khamenei told a gathering of economists last week in Tehran. Although Khamenei remains adamant that his plans do not constitute austerity measures, many here think they will be asked to sacrifice more in the coming year. “We are accustomed to an increase in utility prices each year, but now they are talking about increasing gasoline by 30 percent while the government has only promised to give our salary a 20 percent increase,” said Masoud Mirahmadian, a 33-year-old government office worker. “All in all, I am not hopeful.” Rouhani is also planning reforms to the monthly cash payout program that his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, implemented in late 2010. The payouts replaced heavy state subsidies on many goods and services. To offset high prices during Nowruz last year, Ahmadinejad ordered an additional one-time payment of 800,000 rials (about $25) to most Iranians’ bank accounts. Rouhani, who opposes the cash handouts, offered an alternate plan to help Iranians cope with the high prices of the holiday season. In February, his administration made available baskets of goods to millions of Iranian families that included staples such as rice, cheese, chicken, cooking oil and eggs. But the plan backfired when many lower-income people were inexplicably deemed ineligible to receive the handout, and many who were able to get them complained about the poor quality of the goods. That episode prompted Rouhani to apologize in a nationally televised interview and to set up a series of 400 price-controlled temporary markets throughout the country, including four in the capital. At one such market in Shahrak e Gharb, a neighborhood in western Tehran, hawkers sell everything from locally sourced goat cheese and organic foods to knockoff designer bags and T-shirts. Business at the market is brisk. “There isn’t any shop in the neighborhood that has everything for sale. For the holidays, it’s so convenient to not have to run around the city. I wish the market was here all year long,” said Fatemeh Rezaie, a newlywed housewife. But not everyone is satisfied with the markets, and some consider the initiative a cosmetic fix amid larger difficulties around the corner. “It’s brought so much extra traffic to the neighborhood, and for what? People come here and end up spending too much money because they think they’re getting a good deal,” said Khashayar Mozaffari, a retired accountant who lives nearby. Ali Kashani, a vendor selling locally produced natural extracts of various plants and flowers used in popular Iranian drinks, said that no matter how much of his product he sells, he will lose money at the market. “Shoppers love it because the prices are low and controlled, but for us it doesn’t make sense to sell here,” Kashani said. “I live an hour away, gas is expensive and so are our production costs. But I’ll stay until the end, and hopefully find some long-term customers.”","TEHRAN — As the Iranian year draws to a close, leaders here are attempting to manage the expectations of a public that has seen few signs of the economic improvement promised by President Hassan Rouhani when he took office in August.

0,"TEHRAN — In a bid to cut spending, the Iranian government has ended a massive cash assistance program and launched a celebrity-driven campaign to convince millions of Iranians that they do not need the help. It’s unlikely to be a popular message. As of last month, more than 90 percent of Iranians were receiving monthly direct deposits from the government of about $15 — a sum that many, though certainly not all, depended on to buy staples whose prices have soared in recent years. The payments were launched in 2010 by then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as part of a program to reduce state subsidies on utilities and food. But they ended up costing the government billions of dollars and, many economists say, contributing to Iran’s skyrocketing inflation rate. On Friday, the government of President Hassan Rouhani sent the final payment to Iranians’ bank accounts, and it is taking applications to determine how many people really need the help. To keep that number as low as possible, the government is airing radio and television ads in which professional soccer players and actors say they will not enroll. Most cabinet ministers have urged their staffs not to sign up, and one of the country’s highest-ranking Shiite clerics issued a fatwa Thursday deeming the collection of payments by those who are not poor “religiously problematic.” Deciding who truly needs the help — and slimming such a massive assistance program in general — will be a key test for Rouhani, who was elected in June largely based on his promise of a brighter economic future for all Iranians. The government has not said what the cutoffs for eligibility will be or when the payments will resume. Ahmadinejad’s government originally intended to deliver the deposits only to the needy. But analysts say a combination of limited income data and political turmoil after Ahmadinejad’s disputed 2009 election led him to view the aid as an opportunity to placate a restless society. “Given that the government was already unnerved by the 2009 protests, universalizing the cash grant was the path of least resistance for Ahmadinejad,” said Kevan Harris, a Princeton University sociologist who studies Iran’s social welfare system. For millions of Iranian households, the deposits quickly became an important economic boost during difficult times. The program is now generally accepted as an important first step to wean the public off of overly subsidized utilities, but at a very high cost. The head of the government agency that oversees the deposits said this week that in the 38 months since the program began, the equivalent of more than $50 billion had been paid to Iranian bank accounts. But as the government asks the public to help it reduce the payouts, some recipients are calling the message insensitive to the problems of ordinary people. “My husband is retired, and we rely on the payments to help manage our expenses,” said homemaker Masoumeh Tabrizi, 65. “We must register. I have seen on TV that they are telling people not to take the money, but it seems they do not recognize the situation of people like us.” Alieh Firoozi, another homemaker, said she had already registered for the payments. “If the government doesn’t want to give it to us, let them make that decision, but I think they must take special care of families like ours,” Firoozi said. She said her family of five uses the monthly cash infusions to help cover the expenses of a disabled daughter who requires constant care and lives in a state-run hospital. The online application process is also an effort by authorities to collect financial data from a public that has rarely been willing to divulge such information to the state. The government has warned that those who provide false financial data on their applications will be fined three times as much as their previous monthly deposits. The program changes have coincided with the announcement of utility and gasoline price increases, which are adding to public concerns that this year will be even more economically trying than last year. “Whenever the price of gasoline goes up, so does the price of bread, and when bread gets more expensive so does everything else,” said Marzieh Dolati, a teacher who said she makes the national average income of about $350 per month. “We’re not stupid. We see what’s happening in front of us.” Increasing prices and the national currency’s diminished purchasing power have been among Iranians’ core complaints for several years. If these problems are not resolved, they threaten to undermine the new government’s popularity. “These price hikes will create short-term bursts of inflation,” said Harris, the Princeton sociologist. “There's no getting around it. If the government cannot explain the rationale for the policy as it continues, then people will forget about Ahmadinejad, and Rouhani will assume the blame.”","TEHRAN — In a bid to cut spending, the Iranian government has ended a massive cash assistance program and launched a celebrity-driven campaign to convince millions of Iranians that they do not need the help.

The head of the government agency that oversees the deposits said this week that in the 38 months since the program began, the equivalent of more than $50 billion had been paid to Iranian bank accounts. But as the government asks the public to help it reduce the payouts, some recipients are calling the message insensitive to the problems of ordinary people. “My husband is retired, and we rely on the payments to help manage our expenses,” said homemaker Masoumeh Tabrizi, 65. “We must register. I have seen on TV that they are telling people not to take the money, but it seems they do not recognize the situation of people like us.” Alieh Firoozi, another homemaker, said she had already registered for the payments. “If the government doesn’t want to give it to us, let them make that decision, but I think they must take special care of families like ours,” Firoozi said. She said her family of five uses the monthly cash infusions to help cover the expenses of a disabled daughter who requires constant care and lives in a state-run hospital. The online application process is also an effort by authorities to collect financial data from a public that has rarely been willing to divulge such information to the state. The government has warned that those who provide false financial data on their applications will be fined three times as much as their previous monthly deposits. The program changes have coincided with the announcement of utility and gasoline price increases, which are adding to public concerns that this year will be even more economically trying than last year. “Whenever the price of gasoline goes up, so does the price of bread, and when bread gets more expensive so does everything else,” said Marzieh Dolati, a teacher who said she makes the national average income of about $350 per month. “We’re not stupid. We see what’s happening in front of us.” Increasing prices and the national currency’s diminished purchasing power have been among Iranians’ core complaints for several years. If these problems are not resolved, they threaten to undermine the new government’s popularity. “These price hikes will create short-term bursts of inflation,” said Harris, the Princeton sociologist. “There's no getting around it. If the government cannot explain the rationale for the policy as it continues, then people will forget about Ahmadinejad, and Rouhani will assume the blame.”"
0,"TEHRAN — On the western outskirts of this city, in an industrial neighborhood of factories and dusty half-constructed lots, a metal-walled building houses women with a secret. They are female drug addicts, a growing class of people with a habit so taboo in this traditional Islamic society that some Iranians believe they deserve death. But the modest facility here, a substance-abuse rehabilitation center for women, is one sign that attitudes are slowly changing as Iran begins to confront an uncomfortable problem that long went ignored. The bulk of Afghan opium passes through Iran before it hits the global market, and that access has long contributed to addiction rates that are among the highest in the world. Now they are dramatically rising, particularly among women. Government agencies and international bodies provide conflicting statistics, but Iran’s Drug Control Headquarters estimates that 3 million of Iran’s 76 million citizens are addicts, more than 700,000 of them women — double the number two years ago. “There is starting to be some recognition that addiction is a disease, not a crime,” said Massoumeh, the director of the small center, which is run by women. “But changing minds takes time.” That is in large part because of the stigma attached to female substance abuse, as well as a heavy dose of denial about the roots and scope of the problem. At a conference on drugs in the city of Urmia this month, one government official blamed foreign meddling. “The addiction of women to drugs is a trick by our enemies to attack Islamic values of Iranian families,” Razieh Khodadoust, the director general of the State Welfare Organization of Iran in the West Azerbaijan province, said at the conference. “The enemies of the Islamic republic are planning extensively to spread drugs among Iranian women and they are investing heavily in this project.” Hidden addiction Finding drugs here is easy, and the vast majority of addicts use locally produced crystal methamphetamines or heroin and other opium derivatives. Even so, until recently, the mere thought of women with substance abuse problems seemed unfathomable. Shame was incentive enough for most to hide their habit, making the problem even harder to address. “You can find drugs anywhere, anytime in Iran’s cities. Whatever you’re looking for you can get within a few minutes,” said Nahid, 27, who is seeking treatment at the rehabilitation center for her addiction to heroin and crystal meth. Due to the restrictive nature of Iranian society, women often seek out female-only spaces to get high, adding to the difficulty of tracking use. One surprising venue, according to crystal meth addicts interviewed at the rehabilitation center, are female-only beauty salons, usually operated in private homes. Many women say they were first introduced to meth by other salon customers who raved about its effectiveness in causing rapid weight loss. “Our biggest challenge is that addiction among women is hidden,” Abolreza Rahmani Fazli, Iran’s Minister of Interior and head of the country’s Drug Control Headquarters, said in his annual report earlier this year. Although the bulk of state efforts to combat Iran’s drug problem target traffickers, the government also sponsors strong anti-drug public awareness campaigns. But Rahmani and other officials are calling on nongovernmental organizations to help fight addiction, a battle that Iran’s religiously conservative authorities are ill-equipped to tackle. Providing help That call is part of an increasingly open national debate about how to confront the growing problem, with education and treatment efforts being led by women who have battled addiction and gotten sober. At the rehab center outside Tehran, Massoumeh and a small band of women are quietly trying to help female drug addicts start new lives. Operating for two years, the entire facility is little more than a collection of large rooms surrounding a concrete and gravel courtyard. But it represents a huge improvement over previous versions of women’s rehab centers in Iran, the staff says. When Massoumeh began working in the field 13 years ago, it was much riskier. A group of volunteers would set up tents in forested areas outside of Tehran to treat women, with no protection from law enforcement. “I have no partners, no sponsors, but I’m known in the field of addiction, so people find us,” said Massoumeh, who asked that the facility’s name and her surname not be published because of the sensitivity of the clinic’s activities. “What we do here is based on word of mouth. You can’t advertise this.” In addition to helping addicts get clean, using techniques that mirror international Narcotics Anonymous programs, the clinic works to prepare patients for what is often a bigger, riskier challenge — reintegrating into regular society and returning to the neighborhoods where they previously used drugs. Many female addicts use drugs with a partner, often a spouse or a boyfriend. That was the case for Nahid, who said she started shortly after getting married at age 19 and has been sober for just over three months. She said she plans on getting a divorce as soon as possible, because her husband wants to keep using drugs. “I definitely don’t need another man. My biggest dream is to get healthy, put all of this behind me and build a good life for myself,” said Nahid, who, like other patients interviewed, asked to be identified only by her first name. Sepideh, a 33-year-old who started using drugs when she was 20, checked into the clinic in mid-April, after her employer discovered her substance-abuse problem and fired her. She said that she had just passed the most difficult phase of withdrawal from crystal meth, which involved vivid hallucinations. After several unsuccessful attempts to get sober, she said, she hopes this time will be different. “I want my parents to be proud of me again. They’ve abandoned me,” Sepideh said. That sort of intolerance among family and friends is common, caregivers say, and one of many reasons why the women at the center may ultimately relapse. “Without societal and community support,” Massoumeh said, “we can’t expect the problem to go away.”","TEHRAN — On the western outskirts of this city, in an industrial neighborhood of factories and dusty half-constructed lots, a metal-walled building houses women with a secret.

0,"TEHRAN — For the first time in decades, business people from the United States are visiting Iran in significant numbers, exploring the possibility of future partnerships as Iranian and American entrepreneurs begin to envision a reopening of long-closed commercial channels. Although sanctions blocking most types of trade between the two countries remain in place, there are no bans on travel to Iran. For U.S. citizens granted a visa to Iran, local hosts can organize programs, which have included recent visits to investment firms, Tehran’s stock exchange, factories, farms and high-tech start-ups. The government of President Hassan Rouhani is actively promoting Iran to foreign investors but has said little about the United States specifically, although American oil giants and automakers are thought to have been in discussions with their Iranian counterparts since Rouhani took office in 2013. Longtime partnerships in the energy and auto sectors between Iran and companies in Germany, France and Italy have dwindled in recent years because of the European Union’s own sanctions on Tehran. Despite the drop in foreign investment from Western nations, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development estimated that direct foreign investment in Iran is on the rise, reaching $5 billion in 2012, funded primarily by Chinese, Russian and Turkish companies. But even that figure fell far short of the $7 billion that Iran projected for that year, and the country’s need for foreign capital is continuing to grow. While U.S. investment is unlikely to fill that gap anytime soon, the recent visitors say the potential across multiple sectors is vast. “There will be phenomenal opportunities for American investors. I would definitely consider investing in Iran, and I think that’s the universal answer,” said Dick Simon, chief executive of RSI, a Boston-based real estate development and investment management company, who helped organize a recent trip to Iran composed of mostly U.S. entrepreneurs, as well as several who were Canadian or British. In the absence of diplomatic relations, such contact can serve to de-escalate tensions between the two governments — which analysts say is a strategic goal for the administrations of President Obama and Rouhani — as negotiations over Iran’s controversial nuclear program are ongoing. “An increasing number of Americans, both inside and outside government, understand the value of whetting the appetite of business people in Iran,” said Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American Council (NIAC). According to Marashi, NIAC has been inundated this year by calls from Americans who want to travel to Iran. The organization, which favors greater contact between Americans and Iranians, is one of the few non-governmental entities in regular communication with officials in both governments. But reopening trade will face serious challenges that may take years to resolve. Besides sanctions and the internal guidelines of U.S.-based financial institutions, there are issues that will make investment in Iran a tough sell to U.S. companies. “The current misperceptions and misunderstandings in America regarding Iran as a country, as a society and as a market could be the biggest obstacles” to attracting U.S. investments, said Ramin Rabii, managing director of Turquoise Partners, a Tehran-based investment firm. Other members of Iran’s business community think that the opportunity to trade ideas and begin engaging in commerce could serve as a catalyst to improve political relations. “The more visits like these, focused on people-to-people and business-to-business connections, the easier it will be down the road for a real and long-lasting thaw between Iran and the U.S.,” said Cyrus Razzaghi, president of Ara Enterprise, a consulting group active in business development between Iranian and foreign companies. None of the Iranian businesses interviewed for this article have any American investors; nor do they market to them because of U.S. legal restrictions. Beyond Iran’s energy sector, the Iranian industries seeking foreign partnerships include the rapidly growing IT and nanotechnology sectors. Visitors from the United States say they were impressed by just how advanced the work produced by Iranian engineers and programmers was compared with the levels of other countries in the region, despite the many Internet and telecommunications restrictions imposed by authorities. “With its remarkable geographic position and talent, Iran is seemingly poised to be a central connection between east-west and north-south if the politicians and leaders are willing to unleash it,” said Christopher M. Schroeder, a U.S.-based Internet entrepreneur and author of a recent book on start-ups in the Middle East who visited Iran in April. “To ignore rising economies like these is to ignore where the world is going,” Schroeder said. There are also shared opportunities in traditional industries such as agriculture, as Iran is a top fruit producer. In a packed auditorium inside Iran’s Chamber of Commerce this month, a blueberry farmer from Winona, Minn., delivered a speech to a captivated Iranian audience. Jim Riddle, an expert in organics who was invited to speak about U.S. regulations on organic products at an annual conference in Tehran, said his reasons for coming were to help develop Iran’s organic infrastructure, something he lectures on around the world. “I’m not here to make business deals and find sources of ingredients, but that comes. If relations improve, I can imagine any number of products that are unique to Iran that there is and would be a demand for in the U.S.,” Riddle said. After initial concerns that going to Iran might be illegal or potentially harmful to relations, Riddle accepted the invitation after speaking with State Department officials who told him that his trip “would be consistent with the interests of the U.S.” In the long term and if sanctions are lifted, those interests could include the sale of a range of U.S.-produced goods as Iranians continue to hold the “made in the USA” label in high regard. “U.S. companies could benefit from Iran’s consumption boom fueled by the demands of well-educated Iranian youth, urbanization trends and the ever-expanding consumption patterns of Iranian families,” Rabii said.","TEHRAN — For the first time in decades, business people from the United States are visiting Iran in significant numbers, exploring the possibility of future partnerships as Iranian and American entrepreneurs begin to envision a reopening of long-closed commercial channels.

0,"FOR YEARS the Obama administration, like its predecessors, has avoided punitive action or even harsh words against the authoritarian, populist government of Venezuela, despite its systematic violations of human rights. The thinking is that Hugo Chávez and now his successor, Nicolás Maduro, would use the United States as a foil, distract attention from their failings and earn unjustified sympathy from other Latin Americans who bridle at any hint of U.S. meddling. While there is some truth in that argument, it can be self-defeating, as the past decade shows. U.S. policy toward Venezuela has been largely inert — and yet the Chavistas still use Washington as a foil, inventing the conspiracies that Washington has eschewed. The latest instance came Wednesday, when Mr. Maduro ludicrously claimed that the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Colombia had been conspiring with opposition leaders to assassinate him. The challenge Venezuela poses has become more acute in recent months as mass anti-government protests have erupted; the Maduro government has responded with violent repression. In Congress, there has been bipartisan support for legislation that would mandate sanctions on Venezuelan officials responsible for repression, including a ban on traveling to the United States and a freeze on assets here. The House passed a bill by a voice vote Wednesday, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a similar measure by a vote of 13 to 2. The Obama administration opposes the bills, in part for the same reason it tried to stop similar legislation on Russia two years ago: It says the executive branch does not need authority from Congress to sanction foreign officials guilty of human rights abuses. While Secretary of State John F. Kerry and other officials have hinted that sanctions against Venezuelan leaders may be appropriate at some point, they argue that the moment is not right. They say more time should be given to a dialogue between the government and opposition sponsored by several South American governments, even though Mr. Kerry recently said “there has just been a total failure” by the Maduro government “to demonstrate good faith.” A statement by a dozen South American foreign ministers also claimed the sanctions bills would undermine the mediation effort. The logic is that the wisest course for the United States is to do nothing. That ignores the success sanctions targeting individuals — as opposed to broader economic embargoes — have apparently had in Russia and North Korea. As Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), sponsor of the Senate bill, pointed out, the potential impact on key Venezuelan actors is considerably greater, since many have purchased homes or stashed illicit assets in the United States. Latin American governments will reflexively oppose U.S. sanctions regardless of circumstances, and the Chavista regime will demonize the United States to its dying breath. That doesn’t mean senior generals, police commanders and other officials won’t be swayed by the prospect of being banished from Miami — or that average Venezuelans would react negatively to the exposure and seizure of dollar assets amassed by self-styled socialists.

0,"France’s BNP Paribas pleaded guilty Monday to concealing billions of dollars in transactions for clients in Sudan, Iran and Cuba in violation of U.S. sanctions and agreed to pay $8.9 billion in fines, according to the Justice Department. The agreement includes a rare year-long suspension of the bank’s ability to convert foreign currency into U.S. dollars through its New York office, a step that could potentially cripple one of the bank’s chief functions. Prosecutors say BNP, France’s largest bank, went to elaborate lengths to disguise illicit trans­actions with sanctioned countries. BNP used a network of banks in the Middle East, Europe and Africa with their own clearing codes to mask dollar-based transfers connected to Sudanese companies. Employees also removed information from wire transfers that could have revealed the identity of the countries blacklisted by the United States, according to the complaint. “These activities significantly undermined long-standing U.S. economic sanctions, in many cases to the detriment of America’s national security interests,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said at a news conference Monday. “They continued for years, despite repeated indications and warnings that the bank’s conduct violated U.S. embargoes.” BNP pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act by processing billions of dollars in illicit transactions from 2004 to 2012. The plea agreement, filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, requires the bank to pay a $140 million fine and forfeit $8.8 billion, an amount equal to the transactions that prosecutors identified as criminal. New York’s Department of Financial Services, which regulates the bank, identified $190 billion in transactions that broke federal and state laws, including false books and records violations. As a part of the settlement, the New York agency’s chief, Benjamin M. Lawsky, required BNP to fire 13 bank employees involved in the scheme, including Chief Operating Officer Georges Chodron de Courcel. Lawsky also imposed the dollar-clearing suspension, which takes effect in 2015, in lieu of stripping BNP of its banking license. Monday’s settlement involved several state and federal agencies, including the FBI and the Manhattan district attorney’s office. About half of the $8.9 billion fine will go to the Justice Department and the Federal Reserve, while the remainder will be divided among the New York authorities. In the lead-up to the settlement, French authorities implored their U.S. counterparts to consider the repercussions that severe punishment of the bank could have on the European economy. In May, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin met with Lawsky to plead for leniency. A month earlier, French President François Hollande wrote President Obama to appeal for a penalty proportionate to the misconduct. Obama told the European media that the case was in the hands of the Justice Department. Suspending BNP’s dollar-clearing operations — a critical step in transferring money to clients’ suppliers, processing loan payments and various other transactions — adds a new dimension to the government’s effort to hold banks accountable for wrongdoing. Preventing an investment bank from engaging in one of its most basic business functions, which could result in the loss of customers and millions in revenue, is arguably more damaging than levying a big fine. Lawsky made that argument in a speech to the Exchequer Club of Washington in March, explaining that “new and creative corporate penalties” could promote the “broader objective of deterring misconduct.” At the time, Lawsky said his office was considering a dollar-clearing ban in cases where the service was used to launder money. Federal prosecutors said they received an anonymous tip about BNP’s misdeeds in 2009 and informed the bank of its investigation shortly after. But they said the bank dragged its feet in cooperating with the probe and ending the alleged misconduct, behavior that factored into the hefty fine. For its part, BNP said it conducted an internal review that led to the reprimand of a number of managers and employees, some of whom have left the bank. BNP said it also designed new compliance and control procedures. “We deeply regret the past misconduct that led to this settlement,” Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, chief executive of BNP, said in a statement. “The failures that have come to light in the course of this investigation run contrary to the principles on which BNP Paribas has always sought to operate.” BNP’s $8.9 billion fine eclipses the penalties imposed on other banks for similar misconduct. HSBC, which was accused of laundering money for Mexican drug cartels, previously received the stiffest penalty when it struck a $1.9 billion settlement with Justice. European bankers have bemoaned the U.S. government’s push to hold foreign banks criminally liable for breaking the law, while letting American banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, walk away with only admissions of wrongdoing. In May, Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse became the largest bank in 20 years to plead guilty to helping wealthy Americans hide billions of dollars from U.S. tax collectors. American regulators have waved off allegations of bias, saying the punishments meted out against banks such as Credit Suisse and BNP were commensurate with the severity of their misconduct and lack of cooperation. “We’re not targeting banks outside our shores,” Holder said Monday. “The conduct that we’re talking about potentially [with BNP] put at risk the lives of people outside of the United States because of the terrorist connections.” Washington stepped up efforts to root out money laundering after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The USA Patriot Act of 2002 required the Treasury Department to finger banks and individuals suspected of terrorist links and instructed banks to report illegal transactions. Federal agencies have reached multimillion-dollar settlements with some of the biggest names in banking, including Credit Suisse and Japan’s Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Government agencies have focused on violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, a law requiring financial institutions and their employees to combat money laundering. Justice launched a series of criminal cases under the act, including one against Wachovia in 2010 for failing to stop millions of dollars of Colombian and Mexican drug money from being laundered through accounts at the bank.","France’s BNP Paribas pleaded guilty Monday to concealing billions of dollars in transactions for clients in Sudan, Iran and Cuba in violation of U.S. sanctions and agreed to pay $8.9 billion in fines, according to the Justice Department. The agreement includes a rare year-long suspension of the bank’s ability to convert foreign currency into U.S. dollars through its New York office, a step that could potentially cripple one of the bank’s chief functions. Prosecutors say BNP, France’s largest bank, went to elaborate lengths to disguise illicit trans­actions with sanctioned countries. BNP used a network of banks in the Middle East, Europe and Africa with their own clearing codes to mask dollar-based transfers connected to Sudanese companies. Employees also removed information from wire transfers that could have revealed the identity of the countries blacklisted by the United States, according to the complaint. “These activities significantly undermined long-standing U.S. economic sanctions, in many cases to the detriment of America’s national security interests,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said at a news conference Monday. “They continued for years, despite repeated indications and warnings that the bank’s conduct violated U.S. embargoes.” BNP pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act by processing billions of dollars in illicit transactions from 2004 to 2012. The plea agreement, filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, requires the bank to pay a $140 million fine and forfeit $8.8 billion, an amount equal to the transactions that prosecutors identified as criminal. New York’s Department of Financial Services, which regulates the bank, identified $190 billion in transactions that broke federal and state laws, including false books and records violations. As a part of the settlement, the New York agency’s chief, Benjamin M. Lawsky, required BNP to fire 13 bank employees involved in the scheme, including Chief Operating Officer Georges Chodron de Courcel. Lawsky also imposed the dollar-clearing suspension, which takes effect in 2015, in lieu of stripping BNP of its banking license. Monday’s settlement involved several state and federal agencies, including the FBI and the Manhattan district attorney’s office. About half of the $8.9 billion fine will go to the Justice Department and the Federal Reserve, while the remainder will be divided among the New York authorities. In the lead-up to the settlement, French authorities implored their U.S. counterparts to consider the repercussions that severe punishment of the bank could have on the European economy. In May, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin met with Lawsky to plead for leniency. A month earlier, French President François Hollande wrote President Obama to appeal for a penalty proportionate to the misconduct. Obama told the European media that the case was in the hands of the Justice Department. Suspending BNP’s dollar-clearing operations — a critical step in transferring money to clients’ suppliers, processing loan payments and various other transactions — adds a new dimension to the government’s effort to hold banks accountable for wrongdoing. Preventing an investment bank from engaging in one of its most basic business functions, which could result in the loss of customers and millions in revenue, is arguably more damaging than levying a big fine. Lawsky made that argument in a speech to the Exchequer Club of Washington in March, explaining that “new and creative corporate penalties” could promote the “broader objective of deterring misconduct.” At the time, Lawsky said his office was considering a dollar-clearing ban in cases where the service was used to launder money. Federal prosecutors said they received an anonymous tip about BNP’s misdeeds in 2009 and informed the bank of its investigation shortly after. But they said the bank dragged its feet in cooperating with the probe and ending the alleged misconduct, behavior that factored into the hefty fine. For its part, BNP said it conducted an internal review that led to the reprimand of a number of managers and employees, some of whom have left the bank.

0,"It’s a scandal! It’s a conspiracy! It’s economic warfare! No, not the crimes the U.S. government is punishing the French bank BNP Paribas for perpetrating, but the punishment itself. So say French politicians, at least. On Monday, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to violating U.S. economic sanctions against Sudan, Iran and Cuba. As part of the settlement, it agreed to pay nearly $9 billion and temporarily suspend some of its valuable dollar-clearing services. The magnitude of the penalties — the largest imposed on a financial institution for U.S. sanctions violations — reflect not only the astounding volume of forbidden transactions routed through the U.S. financial system but also the lengths the bank went to to hoodwink authorities. Internal documents revealed that BNP officials falsified records and obscured the countries involved, even as they privately recognized that some of the entities they served were party to a “humanitarian catastrophe” and directly supported terrorists. In other words, BNP officials knew all along that they were behaving badly, from both a moral and a legal standpoint. But no matter. The real problem, French politicians have asserted for the past few months, is that the United States shouldn’t be sticking its nose into BNP’s business. Last month, French President Francois Hollande confronted President Obama over “l’affaire BNP” at a D-Day event, insisting that Obama intervene to ease the proposed fine. Hollande also took up the cause with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European governments, according to the Financial Times. U.S. regulators, after all, are still investigating other foreign banks — including, reportedly, Germany’s Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, Italy’s UniCredit and France’s Credit Agricole and Societe Generale – that may have also violated our trade embargoes. The penalties in those cases could be similarly onerous. The United States is engaging in a cash grab from helpless foreigners, French politicians have intimated, and is attempting to hobble U.S. banks’ competitors. Large fines “sometimes offer some advantages in economic warfare,” French economic minister Arnaud Montebourg said recently, adding ominously, “Maybe we should imitate them.” Never mind that U.S. regulators recently slapped JPMorgan Chase with an even higher penalty of $13 billion over its mortgage business or that Bank of America is anticipating similarly scaled punishment. Extraterritorial bullies that we Americans are, we’ve resorted to stealing France’s lunch money just because we can. Of course, such bristling at the United States’ attempts to curb international companies’ transactions with terrorists, drug cartels and corrupt politicians is nothing new. “You [expletive] Americans,” an executive at London-based Standard Chartered Bank wrote in a leaked e-mail from 2006. “Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we’re not going to deal with Iranians.” Indeed, who are we to exert such control over foreigners’ behavior? We are no longer just the world’s policeman. Thanks to our status as the largest market in the world and the guarantor of the world’s reserve currency, the United States has become the world’s economic conscience, too. And in my view, that is a very good thing as long as we brandish our economic superpower status responsibly. Since the days of our earliest English-speaking settlers, America has tried to be a “city upon a hill.” Believing that the eyes of all people were upon us, we tried to lead by example. Of course, our success at persuading others to embrace our self-proclaimed values of equality and freedom, like our own commitment to them, has been somewhat mixed. And when they would not see the light, we at times sought to impose our ideals (and interests) upon others by force, bludgeoning them into adopting the one true path toward democracy, freedom and respect for human life. Today, however, 238 years to the day after the launch of the American experiment, we have a far superior, and more peaceful, weapon: economic clout. Right now, if not necessarily forever, we live in a world in which we can use our economic superpowers to pressure others to behave more honorably. We can tell the world: If you want to do business with us, or even just transact with our currency, you can’t also be the de facto central bank for the government of Sudan. That’s true even if your home country is uninterested in banning such profiteering. Trade sanctions (and laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) are exactly the kinds of policies we should be pursuing to make the world a better place through our economic influence — instead of, to the maximum extent possible, our military influence.

Washington Post foreign editor Douglas Jehl said the newspaper has received “credible reports” that correspondent Jason Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, were detained Tuesday evening in Tehran. It is unclear who detained them or why. “We are deeply troubled by this news and are concerned for the welfare of Jason, Yeganeh and two others said to have been detained with them,” Jehl said in a statement. Jehl said that Rezaian, who has been The Post’s correspondent in Tehran since 2012, “is an experienced, knowledgeable reporter who deserves protection and whose work merits respect.” Members of Rezaian’s family said they did not want to comment at this time. Rezaian, 38, holds American and Iranian citizenship.

Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, director general of the Tehran Province Justice Department, told reporters that the “Washington Post journalist has been detained for some questions and after technical investigations, the judiciary will provide details on the issue,” the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported. “Iranian security forces are vigilant towards all kind of enemies’ activities, the official added,” IRNA said without elaborating.

0,"An Iranian judicial official confirmed Friday that The Washington Post’s correspondent in Iran is in government custody, according to a report from a state news agency, but officials shed no light on the nature of an investigation that also led to the detention of his wife and two American citizens earlier this week. Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, the head the Justice Department in Tehran Province, was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency saying officials would release more information about Post correspondent Jason Rezaian’s detention “after technical investigations” are complete. Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, said officials at the newspaper were “mystified” by Rezaian’s arrest and remain “profoundly concerned” for his well-being and the others in custody. “Unfortunately, we have received no information about Jason’s whereabouts, his condition, or any allegations that might be made against him,” Baron said in a statement. “We remain hopeful that he and his wife and the other detainees will regain their freedom soon and Jason can resume the work that has earned him respect over many years.” The arrest of Rezaian, 38, who holds American and Iranian citizenship, came as a surprise to colleagues, relatives and close observers of the bilateral relationship between Washington and Tehran, which have been negotiating a landmark deal that would bar Iran from developing an offensive nuclear program. He is the first American journalist known to have been taken into custody in Iran since 2009. Iranian officials have not responded substantively to repeated inquiries from The Post about Rezaian’s detention. Hamid Babaei, a spokesman for the Iranian mission at the United Nations, said Friday he is seeking information from authorities in Iran. The U.S. State Department said it was “concerned” about reports that the four journalists had been detained but was unable to comment further because of “privacy considerations.” The United States and Iran do not have diplomatic relations. “In general, in any case involving the detention of a U.S. citizen in Iran, we would work with our protecting power, Switzerland, to request appropriate consular services,” State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. Asked if the Swiss had been contacted to request contact with Rezaian and the others on behalf of the United States, Harf said, “I don’t have further details . . . that I’m able to share.” The Post and Rezaian’s relatives have not heard from him since he and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, were taken into custody Tuesday evening in their Tehran home. “He hasn’t been able to contact a lawyer who would be able to communicate with us where he is located,” Ali Rezaian, Jason’s brother said Friday. Mary Rezaian, his mother, said she is worried about whether Rezaian has access to the blood-pressure medicine he takes. “It’s really important that he have that,” she said in a phone interview from Istanbul. “Who knows if whoever came and took him gave him time to pick that up.” Experts on Iran said Rezaian’s detention may have been carried out on the orders of hard-line factions within the government that control the intelligence and judicial branches in an effort to undermine President Hassan Rouhani, who is seen as a reformer and has embraced warmer relations with the West. “He was likely sacrificed in this domestic infighting between the hard-liners and Rouhani’s rest of the cabinet,” said Haleh Esfandiari, an Iranian American scholar who heads the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Middle East program and was detained in Iran in 2007. Camelia Entekhabifard, an exiled Iranian journalist based in Dubai, said Rezaian’s detention has already had a chilling effect on journalists in Iran. Colleagues there who are normally forthcoming with her about sensitive issues are being unusually circumspect, said Entekhabifard, who left the country after she was detained in the summer of 1999. “Already local media have limited their contacts with us and are alarmed,” Entekhabifard said. “I lived in Iran and know what these ‘midnight raids’ mean. It’s a nightmare.” She and Esfandiari described Rezaian as a fair and conscientious reporter and said none of his recent stories has been controversial or disclosed sensitive information. “He’s very careful,” Esfandiari said. “If you look at his articles, there is nothing in them that would compromise him.” Rezaian, who has served as The Post’s Tehran correspondent since 2012, has written a wide variety of articles about Iranian politics, foreign policy and culture. His mother said Rezaian, who was raised in California, decided to move to his father’s homeland as an adult in large part because he felt he could offer a nuanced insight of Iran, which he felt was often vilified in the Western press. “There was so much negativity,” Mary Rezaian said, explaining her son’s thinking. “Every time Iran was on the news, they would show hostile crowds storming the gates of the U.S. Embassy. He felt that people in the United States needed to understand that there’s more to Iran than that history.” In a video interview made when he visited The Post’s newsroom in Washington last year for the paper’s Web site, he compared the mood in Iran following the election of Rouhani, to that in the United States following President Obama’s 2008 election. In Iran, Rezaian said, “there are very high expectations, a lot of pressure on the common man and a very difficult road ahead. I think Iranians, especially in the lower and middle classes, are saying, ‘how can this new administration make things different, other than rhetorically?’ ” “A big part of that is potential relations with the United States,” he said, noting a desire in both countries for “some sort of end to this standoff over Iran’s nuclear program. . . . At the end of the day there are many more issues of shared importance . . . that these two countries need to talk about.” In recent months, Rezaian has written from Vienna about Iran’s nuclear negotiations with world powers and the effect of international sanctions inside Iran. He has chronicled the still nascent popularity of baseball in the Islamic Republic, and how its government is grappling with rising female drug addiction. Other recent articles focused on government failure to deal with “a water shortage of epic proportions,” and a parliamentary move to ban abortions and criminalize permanent forms of contraception as Iran’s birthrate has fallen. The two other Americans detained Tuesday are a female freelance photojournalist and her husband. A relative of the woman said the family is working through contacts in Iran to secure their release. He said relatives have asked that their names not be made public. Before Rezaian and those arrested with him, at least 10 U.S. citizens have been arrested in Iran over the past decade.","An Iranian judicial official confirmed Friday that The Washington Post’s correspondent in Iran is in government custody, according to a report from a state news agency, but officials shed no light on the nature of an investigation that also led to the detention of his wife and two American citizens earlier this week. Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, the head the Justice Department in Tehran Province, was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency saying officials would release more information about Post correspondent Jason Rezaian’s detention “after technical investigations” are complete. Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, said officials at the newspaper were “mystified” by Rezaian’s arrest and remain “profoundly concerned” for his well-being and the others in custody. “Unfortunately, we have received no information about Jason’s whereabouts, his condition, or any allegations that might be made against him,” Baron said in a statement. “We remain hopeful that he and his wife and the other detainees will regain their freedom soon and Jason can resume the work that has earned him respect over many years.” The arrest of Rezaian, 38, who holds American and Iranian citizenship, came as a surprise to colleagues, relatives and close observers of the bilateral relationship between Washington and Tehran, which have been negotiating a landmark deal that would bar Iran from developing an offensive nuclear program. He is the first American journalist known to have been taken into custody in Iran since 2009. Iranian officials have not responded substantively to repeated inquiries from The Post about Rezaian’s detention. Hamid Babaei, a spokesman for the Iranian mission at the United Nations, said Friday he is seeking information from authorities in Iran. The U.S. State Department said it was “concerned” about reports that the four journalists had been detained but was unable to comment further because of “privacy considerations.” The United States and Iran do not have diplomatic relations. “In general, in any case involving the detention of a U.S. citizen in Iran, we would work with our protecting power, Switzerland, to request appropriate consular services,” State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. Asked if the Swiss had been contacted to request contact with Rezaian and the others on behalf of the United States, Harf said, “I don’t have further details . . . that I’m able to share.” The Post and Rezaian’s relatives have not heard from him since he and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, were taken into custody Tuesday evening in their Tehran home. “He hasn’t been able to contact a lawyer who would be able to communicate with us where he is located,” Ali Rezaian, Jason’s brother said Friday. Mary Rezaian, his mother, said she is worried about whether Rezaian has access to the blood-pressure medicine he takes. “It’s really important that he have that,” she said in a phone interview from Istanbul. “Who knows if whoever came and took him gave him time to pick that up.” Experts on Iran said Rezaian’s detention may have been carried out on the orders of hard-line factions within the government that control the intelligence and judicial branches in an effort to undermine President Hassan Rouhani, who is seen as a reformer and has embraced warmer relations with the West. “He was likely sacrificed in this domestic infighting between the hard-liners and Rouhani’s rest of the cabinet,” said Haleh Esfandiari, an Iranian American scholar who heads the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Middle East program and was detained in Iran in 2007. Camelia Entekhabifard, an exiled Iranian journalist based in Dubai, said Rezaian’s detention has already had a chilling effect on journalists in Iran. Colleagues there who are normally forthcoming with her about sensitive issues are being unusually circumspect, said Entekhabifard, who left the country after she was detained in the summer of 1999. “Already local media have limited their contacts with us and are alarmed,” Entekhabifard said. “I lived in Iran and know what these ‘midnight raids’ mean. It’s a nightmare.” She and Esfandiari described Rezaian as a fair and conscientious reporter and said none of his recent stories has been controversial or disclosed sensitive information. “He’s very careful,” Esfandiari said. “If you look at his articles, there is nothing in them that would compromise him.” Rezaian, who has served as The Post’s Tehran correspondent since 2012, has written a wide variety of articles about Iranian politics, foreign policy and culture. His mother said Rezaian, who was raised in California, decided to move to his father’s homeland as an adult in large part because he felt he could offer a nuanced insight of Iran, which he felt was often vilified in the Western press. “There was so much negativity,” Mary Rezaian said, explaining her son’s thinking. “Every time Iran was on the news, they would show hostile crowds storming the gates of the U.S. Embassy. He felt that people in the United States needed to understand that there’s more to Iran than that history.” In a video interview made when he visited The Post’s newsroom in Washington last year for the paper’s Web site, he compared the mood in Iran following the election of Rouhani, to that in the United States following President Obama’s 2008 election. In Iran, Rezaian said, “there are very high expectations, a lot of pressure on the common man and a very difficult road ahead.

1,"The State Department on Monday called for the release of The Washington Post’s Iran correspondent, Jason Rezaian, who was detained last week in Tehran along with his wife and two others for undetermined reasons. Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said Washington had asked the Swiss government, which helps with U.S. consular cases in Iran, for assistance in Rezaian’s case. The United States and Iran do not have formal diplomatic relations. “We call on the Iranian government to immediately release Mr. Rezaian and the other three individuals,” Psaki said Monday afternoon during a State Department news briefing. The Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, said last week that the newspaper was “mystified” and “deeply concerned” about the arrest, which an Iranian judicial official confirmed Friday. Rezaian, 38, who holds American and Iranian citizenship, has been The Post’s correspondent in Tehran since 2012. His wife, Yeganeh Salehi, 30, is a correspondent for the National newspaper, which is based in the United Arab Emirates. Salehi’s parents, Fatemeh Talaeee and Koroush Salehi, issued a statement over the weekend expressing concern about the detentions. “Yeganeh and Jason love Iran and have always tried to show a fair picture of the country in their reporting,” the couple said. “As their parents we have the right to know how they are after six days. We do not know why they are being held but we are certain they have done nothing wrong and would never do anything against Iran.” Rezaian was born and raised in Marin County, in the San Francisco Bay area. He and his older brother Ali had relatively little exposure to their Iranian father’s homeland until Jason was in his 20s and their dad started going home for visits. “Once my dad went back the first time, Jason became very interested in it,” Ali Rezaian said in a phone interview from San Francisco. “He started studying Farsi on his own.” After completing his studies at the New School, a university in New York, in 2000, Jason Rezaian began spending long stretches in Iran, where he worked as a freelance journalist for Western news organizations and helped produce a documentary called “A World Between.” At the time, there was some optimism that Iran was becoming more welcoming to dual nationals and the international community in general, Ali Rezaian said. “It was really important to him that people understand what life was like in Iran,” he said. Jason Rezaian’s roots in Iran deepened several years ago when he met Salehi, who is Iranian, through mutual friends in the journalism community. The two got married in April 2013 in Iran, in a wedding that blended Jason’s bi-national family and Salehi’s more traditional one. “The wedding was beautiful,” Ali Rezaian said. “Everyone had a wonderful time; it was a wonderful ceremony.” The pair have been particularly drawn to feature stories about issues that are not in the news but give readers a taste of modern Iran. Salehi, for instance, recently filed a piece on the controversy ignited by an Iranian imitation of the hit American television series “Modern Family.” One of Rezaian’s most recent reports was about surging enthusiasm in Iran for baseball. As one of the few American-born journalists in Iran, Rezaian was keenly aware of the rigorous rules and procedures foreign correspondents must follow to remain accredited as journalists in the country. He and his wife were mindful of the risks of reporting in a country where the news media is tightly controlled, his brother said. “Jason is aware of the rules and what he was licensed to do,” he said. “They respected the process put in place there.” In recent months, the couple planned to start spending significant periods of time in the United States, where Salehi has been approved for permanent residency. They were planning to travel Saturday, Ali Rezaian said. Instead of hosting a homecoming, relatives spent the weekend scrambling for news and leads about the case. “At this point, the government hasn’t told us where they are being held or what they’re being questioned about,” the brother said. Hamid Babaei, a spokesman for the Iranian mission at the United Nations, did not respond to an e-mail Monday. Officials have not provided information about the arrest of another couple detained that night, a female photojournalist and her husband. Relatives said Monday that contrary to earlier reports, the husband does not work as a journalist. News of the arrests has brought back grim memories to Roxana Saberi, an American-Iranian journalist who was detained in 2009 while working in Tehran. Saberi, who works for Al Jazeera America in New York, recalls being interrogated while blindfolded during sessions that dragged on for days. Detained journalists are often held in solitary confinement, coerced to make false confessions and urged to disclose sensitive information about colleagues and acquaintances, Saberi said in an interview Monday. “The uncertainty is one of the scariest parts,” she said. “They can make you believe that you can stay there for 10, 20 years or even get the death penalty if you don’t cooperate.” Saberi said Iranian officials urge detainees to tell their relatives not to publicize their plight. She said she’s glad her relatives and supporters didn’t abide by that request. “I haven’t seen many cases where staying quiet has helped,” she said. “In high-profile cases like this, it seems the more of a public outcry there is, the better. I believe there are decision-makers in Iran that do care” about the international backlash.","The State Department on Monday called for the release of The Washington Post’s Iran correspondent, Jason Rezaian, who was detained last week in Tehran along with his wife and two others for undetermined reasons.

1,"IRAN’S RELATIONS with international media have improved considerably since the election of Hassan Rouhani as president and the beginning of serious negotiations over its nuclear program. More Western journalists have been allowed to visit the country, Mr. Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have given numerous interviews to Western journalists and U.S. newspapers, including The Post, have featured their op-eds. So much has the climate improved that U.S. conservatives routinely charge that U.S. media have been seduced by the new leadership. The enhanced interchange is one reason the detention of The Post’s correspondent in Tehran, Jason Rezaian, is so unwarranted. Mr. Rezaian, a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen, and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who is also a journalist, were arrested at their home last Tuesday. Since then, their families and The Post have not heard from them, though an Iranian judicial official confirmed Friday that they were in government custody. Two U.S. citizens working as freelance photographers are also being held. No charges have been brought, and the detainees apparently have had no access to legal counsel. Their whereabouts are unknown. Mr. Rezaian, who grew up in California as the son of an Iranian immigrant, went to the country in 2012 because he believed he could offer a more nuanced portrait of Iran, his mother told The Post. He has reported not just on political developments in Tehran but also on social issues, such as a water shortage, and cultural developments, including a nascent Iranian appetite for baseball. When he was arrested, he had just returned from covering the latest round of negotiations in Vienna over Iran’s nuclear program, where the two sides reported progress and agreed to a four-month extension. In an interview last year with Post videojournalists, Mr. Rezaian said he had observed that both Iranians and Americans wanted “some sort of end to this standoff over Iran’s nuclear program” because “at the end of the day there are many more issues of shared importance . . . that these two countries need to talk about.” That pretty well sums up the argument Mr. Rouhani has advanced since his election, as well as that of President Obama since he came to office. So why have Mr. Rezaian, Ms. Salehi and the photographers suddenly become the first American journalists detained in Iran since 2009? Post editors say they have no answers. What is known is that Mr. Rezaian, 38, suffers from high blood pressure and probably does not have access to his regular medication. In addition to endangering his health, his arrest silences a reporter who was dedicated to fairly explaining Iran to Washington readers. It also raises questions about whether Mr. Rouhani’s professed policy of “constructive engagement” is still in effect. Tehran could quickly and easily silence these doubts by unconditionally releasing Mr. Rezaian, Ms. Salehi and the other Americans.

1,"A senior Obama administration official on Tuesday called on Iran to release a Washington Post journalist and his wife, as well as two other Americans who were arrested in Tehran last week without explanation. “There is absolutely no reason for this to occur,” Wendy Sherman, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, said at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The arrest of the Post’s Iran correspondent, Jason Rezaian, who holds U.S. and Iranian citizenship, has raised concerns, Sherman said. She said the State Department has used “the appropriate channels, principally the Swiss,’’ to convey its message to the authorities in Tehran. The United States and Iran do not have formal diplomatic relations, and Switzerland provides consular assistance in Iran. Sherman noted that Rezaian had recently been in Vienna, reporting on the high-stakes negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, the principal focus of Tuesday’s hearing. Rezaian’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who is Iranian, is a correspondent for the National newspaper, which is based in the United Arab Emirates. Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said that Rezaian’s reporting is “certainly . . . balanced.” So, he asked, in the midst of the nuclear talks, “how is it that the Iranians detain U.S. citizens for what is . . . nothing of any great consequence?” He added, “I hope they understand very clearly that actions like these undermine whatever negotiating posture they have at the table.” One of the people arrested, the husband of a photojournalist, was released Tuesday, according to a relative. The photojournalist remains in custody, the family member said. Their names are being withheld at the request of the family. Both are Iranian American. Rezaian’s mother issued an appeal on video Tuesday asking Iran to release him and his wife. Also Tuesday, Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) sent a letter to Secretary of State John F. Kerry expressing his concern about Rezaian’s detention and asking that Kerry “undertake every diplomatic effort to ensure that the Iranian regime does not unjustly punish him and his colleagues for their reporting.” Sherman’s remarks came at a hearing devoted to discussing the status of the negotiations among Iran, the United States and five other world powers to curtail Iran’s nuclear program. The countries agreed in November on a Joint Plan of Action aimed at reaching a deal to ease sanctions in exchange for ensuring that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. Menendez and the committee’s ranking Republican, Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), stressed that they do not want the negotiations, which have been extended to Nov. 24, to go beyond that date. “At that point, Iran will have exhausted its opportunities to put real concessions on the table,” Menendez said, “and I will be prepared to move forward with additional sanctions.” At the hearing, Sherman repeatedly assured the committee that the administration would keep it apprised of the details of the talks and would consult members before agreeing to lift any sanctions, which the government is required to do. She said there are several criteria for a good agreement, “one that cuts off all of Iran’s potential paths to a nuclear weapon”: limiting Iran’s ability to make plutonium at its Arak reactor, to enrich uranium at its Natanz and Fordow facilities, and to develop a covert nuclear program. She said sanctions relief would come only after Iran took “verifiable steps” under a comprehensive deal. “Our goal is to structure an agreement that would make any attempt to break out of such an agreement so visible and so time-consuming that Iran would either be deterred from trying or stopped before it could succeed,” Sherman said. Treasury Undersecretary David S. Cohen said that despite limited sanctions relief since last fall, Iran remains “in a deep economic hole.” The value of the rial has dropped by about 7 percent, and Iran has lost $20 billion in oil revenue in the past six months and stands to lose $15 billion more in the next four months.","A senior Obama administration official on Tuesday called on Iran to release a Washington Post journalist and his wife, as well as two other Americans who were arrested in Tehran last week without explanation. “There is absolutely no reason for this to occur,” Wendy Sherman, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, said at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

0,"The State Department has no new information on the whereabouts or welfare of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, detained two weeks ago in Iran, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Tuesday. “We remain concerned about his detention in Iran,” along with others seized July 22, Psaki said. “Our focus is on doing everything possible to secure the safe return and release of Mr. Rezaian and the others detained with him,” Psaki said. “We, of course, call on the Iranian government and continue to call on the Iranian government to immediately release him and the other individuals.” Rezaian was arrested with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, and two other people. One was released but the others remain jailed and have not been heard from. Iran has announced no charges. The names of the others arrested with Rezaian and Salehi have not been made widely public, but Psaki noted that both Rezaian and the third person held hold dual citizenship. The State Department has requested access to Rezaian and the other dual national, working through Switzerland, which has acted as an intermediary since the rupture of U.S.-Iranian diplomatic relations following the 1979 revolution. Iran does not recognize dual citizenship, considering those who hold it to be Iranian only, and thus routinely denies such requests for jail visits by the Swiss. Psaki said there was no update to report on the Swiss request, indicating that Iran has either denied the request or has not responded. Psaki also said she could not corroborate or refute media reports on Monday that a caretaker or doorman at Rezaian’s apartment building died after an altercation with Iranian security agents seeking Rezaian’s arrest. “We, of course, have seen the reports that an individual in Mr. Rezaian’s building died from injuries sustained” at the time of the arrest, Psaki said. “We don't have any further information or confirmation of those reports.” The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a question about the veracity of those reports or queries about Rezaian’s whereabouts or status. Iran has periodically arrested dual nationals visiting or working in Iran, in some cases holding them for many months. Asked Tuesday about the United States’ continued negotiations with Iran while it holds Americans, Psaki said the matters are separate. The talks, which will resume within a month, are aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.","The State Department has no new information on the whereabouts or welfare of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, detained two weeks ago in Iran, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Tuesday. “We remain concerned about his detention in Iran,” along with others seized July 22, Psaki said. “Our focus is on doing everything possible to secure the safe return and release of Mr. Rezaian and the others detained with him,” Psaki said. “We, of course, call on the Iranian government and continue to call on the Iranian government to immediately release him and the other individuals.” Rezaian was arrested with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, and two other people.

The State Department has requested access to Rezaian and the other dual national, working through Switzerland, which has acted as an intermediary since the rupture of U.S.-Iranian diplomatic relations following the 1979 revolution. Iran does not recognize dual citizenship, considering those who hold it to be Iranian only, and thus routinely denies such requests for jail visits by the Swiss. Psaki said there was no update to report on the Swiss request, indicating that Iran has either denied the request or has not responded. Psaki also said she could not corroborate or refute media reports on Monday that a caretaker or doorman at Rezaian’s apartment building died after an altercation with Iranian security agents seeking Rezaian’s arrest. “We, of course, have seen the reports that an individual in Mr. Rezaian’s building died from injuries sustained” at the time of the arrest, Psaki said. “We don't have any further information or confirmation of those reports.” The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a question about the veracity of those reports or queries about Rezaian’s whereabouts or status. Iran has periodically arrested dual nationals visiting or working in Iran, in some cases holding them for many months. Asked Tuesday about the United States’ continued negotiations with Iran while it holds Americans, Psaki said the matters are separate. The talks, which will resume within a month, are aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions."
0,"The detention of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and two other journalists in Iran is an internal matter in which the United States has no say, a senior Iranian official has told a prominent conservative newspaper. The remarks by Deputy Foreign Minister Hassan Ghashghavi, published Wednesday, are only the second government comment on the case since Rezaian, his wife and two others were detained July 22. One was released, and the others have not been heard from since. Iran has not announced any charges, and it is not clear where the three are being held. The detentions concern Iranian citizens and are a matter for Iran to adjudicate, Ghashghavi said, speaking in Farsi. He was quoted by the hard-line daily Vatan-e-Emrooz, and his remarks were translated and reported by Agence France-Presse and other news media in Tehran. Rezaian, 38, and a photojournalist arrested at the same time are dual Iranian and American citizens. Rezaian’s wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, is also being held. At his family’s request, The Post is not publishing the name of the photojournalist. “We do not accept dual nationalities. If a person enters Iran with an Iranian passport, that person is considered an Iranian citizen,” Ghashghavi said, according to AFP. “We do not allow other countries to demand consular rights on behalf of Iranians.” The State Department has sought access to the Iranian Americans in detention through Switzerland, which acts as an intermediary because the United States and Iran have no diplomatic relations. Visits by Swiss Embassy personnel, called consular visits, are routinely denied when detainees are dual nationals. The United States has called for the immediate release of Rezaian and the others. “So far, we have not received a letter requesting freedom for these journalists,” Ghashgavi was quoted as saying. “But as it is about journalists, the matter could be followed up through foreign diplomatic channels.” That may be a reference to Switzerland, although it was not clear what he meant. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Tuesday that she had no update to report on the Swiss request, and it is not clear whether Iran has denied the request outright or declined to respond. Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron has written to the press counselor at Iran’s mission to the United Nations to ask that Rezaian and the others be released. “Sadly, inexplicably, we continue to hear nothing from Iran about Jason, his wife Yeganeh, and other detainees,” Baron said in a statement Wednesday. “We do not know where he is, we do not know why he is being held, and we know nothing about his health — which is a particular concern to us and his family. Those familiar with Jason’s work have remarked on his genuine desire to offer insight into Iran’s culture and people, and we can imagine no good reason for him to be held. We dearly hope that Jason, his wife, and others will regain their freedom soon.” The only previous Iranian government comment on the case, three days after the arrests, suggested espionage or acts of subterfuge, but the authorities have made no specific allegations. A columnist for Vatan-e-Emrooz has claimed that Rezaian was involved in the creation and release of a YouTube video of unveiled Iranian women dancing to the Pharrell Williams hit song “Happy.” The video caused an uproar in Iran this spring. Rezaian wrote about the video in May.","The detention of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and two other journalists in Iran is an internal matter in which the United States has no say, a senior Iranian official has told a prominent conservative newspaper.

1,"Mary Breme Rezaian lives in Istanbul.  From an early age, my son Jason Rezaian has been fascinated by his father’s home country, Iran. Despite growing up in the United States, he learned Farsi, enjoyed playing backgammon at warm family gatherings with his Iranian relatives and came to love the music, culture and, of course, the food of Iran. His California car’s license plate holder reads “Powered by ghormeh sabzi” in homage to his favorite dish. It’s amazing how many Iranian Americans he has met because of that. For his eighth birthday, we got Jason a passport in the hope that he would one day visit his father’s homeland, but it was not until he had completed college that he began to travel back and forth, increasingly captivated by a culture and a people he loves. By his early 20s, Jason had traveled to historic Tabriz, to Bam before the disastrous earthquake, to magnificent and incomparable Isfahan and to the holy sites of Mashhad, where generations of his relatives live and are buried. He was fascinated by the interplay between modern cities and traditional rural villages that represent the two major facets of developing Iranian society. The images of Iran that Jason saw in the U.S. media troubled him greatly because he knew how limited and inaccurate most of them were. “The American public and their leaders need to see the real Iran, all its parts,” he once told me. When he moved there to work as a freelance journalist (he eventually would become a correspondent for The Post), his aim was to showcase Iran’s untold stories to the West — and to always write nuanced reports. For many hundreds of years, Persia has been a destination for world travelers. But during the past three decades, a generation of Americans’ knowledge of Iran has been shaped by watching archival TV footage providing precious little context. Jason is a global citizen whose extended travels have allowed him to make many dear friends in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Everywhere he goes, he tells people about the beauty and wonders of Iran. He has encouraged countless people, including many Americans, to travel to Iran to experience this beauty for themselves. Ironically, one of Iran’s premier ambassadors has now been silenced. For despite his great love of Iran, my outgoing son and his lovely wife, Yeganeh Salehi, have been detained in Iran, without charge, for three weeks. They and two others (one of whom has been released) were taken from their homes on July 22. This kind of treatment of professional journalists who were credentialed by the Iranian government as members of the foreign press corps is unconscionable. We do not know why they were taken, who took them and what charges — if any — they face. I don’t even know if Jason and Yeganeh are being held together. Our family and hers have been turned upside down with fear and worry, and there has been little news to dispel that fear as we wait to find out why they are being held. While Yeganeh was allowed brief contact with her family, Jason’s brother and I have gotten no word from him. Yegi is a vibrant spirit, and Jason is warm and fun-loving. Our families are deeply concerned for their well-being and about the consequences of their detainment. Jason has high blood pressure, which requires him to take medication daily. I have no idea whether his health is in peril and have no way of communicating with people around him to tell them of his medical condition. The silence is unbearable. For all these reasons, I am imploring Iranian officials to release Jason and Yeganeh immediately. Iran is a complex and multilayered society that is often misperceived and vilified by the West. My son and daughter-in-law have committed themselves to dispelling many of these misconceptions through their nuanced and fair reporting.

0,"TEHRAN — A Washington Post reporter and two other journalists detained last month are being held over “security issues,” Iran’s judiciary spokesman said Monday, offering the first official indication on why they are being held. Post reporter Jason Rezaian, his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and two photojournalists were detained July 22 here in Iran’s capital. One photojournalist was later released. Spokesman Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejehi told reporters Monday that the case of the three journalists is still in the “initial stages of investigation.” “The reason behind their detention is not financial but security issues,” Ejehi said. He did not elaborate. The Post has said that Rezaian, 38, holds both American and Iranian citizenship. His wife is an Iranian citizen who has applied for U.S. permanent residency and works as a correspondent for an Abu Dhabi-based daily newspaper, the National. Both newspapers have called for the couple’s release. The identity of the detained photojournalist remains unknown. Iranian officials previously have said that the country does not recognize dual citizenship and suggested that those held would face justice under local law. Officials have not commented publicly on the specific reasons for the arrests or what charges the detainees might face. Gholam Hossein Esmaili, director general of Tehran province’s justice department, was quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency as saying last month that Iranian security forces are “vigilant towards all kind of enemies’ activities” and that “security forces won’t allow that our country be a parading ground for the enemy and its agents.” He did not elaborate.","TEHRAN — A Washington Post reporter and two other journalists detained last month are being held over “security issues,” Iran’s judiciary spokesman said Monday, offering the first official indication on why they are being held.

0,"A photojournalist arrested in Iran alongside Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian and his wife was released on bail Wednesday, a family source said. Separately, the State Department said U.S. officials raised the arrest and detention of The Post’s Tehran bureau chief, an American citizen, when they met for rare direct talks with Iranian diplomats this month. Rezaian’s wife, journalist Yeganeh Salehi, is an Iranian citizen. Both developments come amid signs that the case is part of an internal Iranian political struggle. At her family’s request, The Post is not publishing the name of the photojournalist released Wednesday. A relative in the United States said she had been freed but had few other details. The relative spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect the woman’s safety. The State Department had no immediate comment on her case. Like Rezaian, the photojournalist holds dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship and had traveled back and forth between the United States and Iran. Iran does not recognize dual nationality and maintains that the United States has no say in detentions by Iran of those who hold U.S. and Iranian passports. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf confirmed Tuesday that the Rezaian case was on the agenda when senior U.S. officials met with Iranian envoys this month in Geneva. She declined to provide any details of the discussion. “We always raise concerns about any American citizen of concern to us,” Harf said. She again called on Iran to release Rezaian. U.S. officials said they had no new information about the July 22 arrests of Rezaian, Salehi and the photojournalist. The three were detained without public charges. Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns, White House adviser Jacob J. Sullivan and others traveled to Geneva for talks Aug. 7 aimed at strengthening larger international negotiations toward a landmark nuclear accord with Iran. The U.S.-Iran meeting was the first such gathering since Rezaian’s arrest. It was one of only a handful of direct sessions between the two countries since the United States and Iran broke off diplomatic ties more than 30 years ago after the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and the seizure of American hostages. Four weeks after Rezaian’s arrest, his case looks increasingly like an attempt by hard-liners to embarrass and undermine President Hassan Rouhani, a comparative reformer. The arrest took place at a critical juncture as Rouhani tries to complete the nuclear deal by a November deadline and improve ties with the United States, analysts and diplomats said. Rezaian was among the most prominent foreign journalists working in Tehran and had covered the maneuvering between Rouhani and unelected government bodies suspicious that the potential deal would weaken Iran. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, endorsed Rouhani’s effort to reach a deal that could relieve years of crippling economic sanctions, but Rouhani faces numerous political obstacles and competing agendas. Although Iran’s official willingness to bargain over the past year was the first breakthrough after years of fruitless international efforts to rein in the country’s disputed nuclear program, it remains unclear how far Rouhani can go and whether any deal he brokers can hold up. Rouhani’s apparent inability either to prevent Rezaian’s arrest or to win his quick release undermines his international credibility, said Haleh Esfandiari, director of Middle East programs at the Wilson Center and herself a former detainee in Iran’s Evin prison. “This was really trying to undermine Rouhani and all his efforts to come to a deal with the United States and also open up the society more,” Esfandiari said. “It’s definitely based on an internal rivalry.” A brief statement Monday from Iran’s judiciary spokesman that Rezaian is being held for unspecified security allegations may further the theory that the arrest is part of a power struggle. To date, the only official statements about the case have come from individuals or institutions associated with Iran’s powerful conservative bloc, which is widely skeptical of Rouhani and generally opposes the potential agreement curbing Iran’s nuclear program. Rouhani, elected in 2013 on a platform of moderate reform and engagement with the West, has said nothing publicly. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who is leading the nuclear talks and has met directly with Secretary of State John F. Kerry, also has not spoken publicly about the arrest. Both men will be in New York in September for the annual United Nations General Assembly gathering, which for years has has served as a platform for Iranian leaders. Conservative critics of Rouhani scored a victory Wednesday when Iran’s parliament fired the country’s science, research and technology minister, a Rouhani associate. Reuters reported that parliament criticized the official for allowing students expelled over anti-government protests in 2009 to return to university classes. His ouster marks the first time parliament has sacked a government minister since Rouhani’s election. Rouhani quickly named another moderate as acting science minister, the news service reported. Rezaian, 38, has had no contact with his family, employer or with Swiss diplomats who sought to visit him on behalf of the United States.

0,"A military-chartered aircraft carrying about 100 Americans from Afghanistan to Dubai landed unexpectedly in Iran on Friday after Iranian officials questioned its flight plan and ordered it down, U.S. and regional officials said. Officials said the pilots landed of their own accord in the city of Bandar Abbas after being warned that the plane would be intercepted if they did not land. One U.S. official familiar with an initial report about the incident said Iranian fighter jets were scrambled, but the State Department later denied any Iranian military involvement. In a statement, the department described the incident as a “bureaucratic issue.” In a later statement Friday night, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said that the issue had been resolved and that the plane “has departed Iran and landed in Dubai.” The operator of the aircraft, FlyDubai, is based in the United Arab Emirates. An official from the region, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of reluctance to become involved in a U.S.-Iran issue, said that confusion occurred when the plane, chartered by the U.S.-led international military command in Afghanistan, left Bagram air base, north of Kabul, several hours after its scheduled departure time. When it entered Iranian airspace, the official said, air traffic controllers there had no updated flight plan reflecting its presence. A U.S. official said that the Iranians ordered the plane back to Afghanistan but that the pilot replied that he did not have enough fuel for the return trip. The Iranians subsequently ordered the plane to land, this official said. The Iranian government made no initial comment on the incident. FlyDubai aircraft regularly fly in Iranian airspace. The company operates commercial flights between Iran and various points in the region. Bandar Abbas, a city on the strategic Strait of Hormuz, is the location of Iran’s main naval base, and its civilian airport is also used by the Iranian air force. In 1988, as U.S. warships patrolled the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War, a missile mistakenly fired from the USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian commercial airliner that had taken off from Bandar Abbas, killing all 290 people aboard. That plane also was en route to Dubai, about a 30-minute flight away. In a settlement reached eight years later, the United States agreed to pay $61.8 million in compensation to the families of the dead.","A military-chartered aircraft carrying about 100 Americans from Afghanistan to Dubai landed unexpectedly in Iran on Friday after Iranian officials questioned its flight plan and ordered it down, U.S. and regional officials said.

0,"DUBAI — An airliner with a group of Americans that was diverted to Iran on Friday landed safely in Dubai early Saturday. The chartered flight, carrying about 100 Americans from Bagram air base in Afghanistan, was diverted to the Iranian city of Bandar Abbas because the crew had supplied “false information,” an Iranian official said Saturday. “The crew used false information so the authorities became suspicious. . . . Because the information provided was incorrect, we asked the airplane to land so we could gather more information,” said Jassem Jaderi, governor of Hormozgan province in southern Iran, according to the state-run Mehr News Agency. A U.S. State Department official said the plane had failed to update its flight plan after leaving Bagram several hours late for Dubai on a route that took it into Iranian airspace. In a statement Friday, the department described the incident as a “bureaucratic issue.” When Iranian civil aviation officials identified the plane, they could not find it in their system because it was supposed to have flown through hours earlier, the official said. Iranian officials first told the pilots to return to Bagram, but when told that the aircraft did not have enough fuel for the return trip, officials instructed the pilots to land at Bandar Abbas, the U.S. official said. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said that contrary to some media reports, “no Iranian jets were scrambled in this situation.” “We appreciate the efforts of all parties to help the passengers get safely to their destination,” she added. The United States and Iran have not had direct diplomatic ties since the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and the subsequent seizure of the U.S. Embassy and its staff in Tehran in November of that year. The operator of the aircraft, FlyDubai, is based in the United Arab Emirates, which does have diplomatic ties with Iran. FlyDubai aircraft regularly fly in Iranian airspace.

  ","DUBAI — An airliner with a group of Americans that was diverted to Iran on Friday landed safely in Dubai early Saturday. The chartered flight, carrying about 100 Americans from Bagram air base in Afghanistan, was diverted to the Iranian city of Bandar Abbas because the crew had supplied “false information,” an Iranian official said Saturday. “The crew used false information so the authorities became suspicious. . . . Because the information provided was incorrect, we asked the airplane to land so we could gather more information,” said Jassem Jaderi, governor of Hormozgan province in southern Iran, according to the state-run Mehr News Agency. A U.S. State Department official said the plane had failed to update its flight plan after leaving Bagram several hours late for Dubai on a route that took it into Iranian airspace. In a statement Friday, the department described the incident as a “bureaucratic issue.” When Iranian civil aviation officials identified the plane, they could not find it in their system because it was supposed to have flown through hours earlier, the official said. Iranian officials first told the pilots to return to Bagram, but when told that the aircraft did not have enough fuel for the return trip, officials instructed the pilots to land at Bandar Abbas, the U.S. official said. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said that contrary to some media reports, “no Iranian jets were scrambled in this situation.” “We appreciate the efforts of all parties to help the passengers get safely to their destination,” she added. The United States and Iran have not had direct diplomatic ties since the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and the subsequent seizure of the U.S. Embassy and its staff in Tehran in November of that year. The operator of the aircraft, FlyDubai, is based in the United Arab Emirates, which does have diplomatic ties with Iran. FlyDubai aircraft regularly fly in Iranian airspace. The company operates commercial flights between Iran and various points in the Persian Gulf region. Bandar Abbas, a city on the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the passageway from the gulf to the Arabian Sea, is the location of Iran’s main naval base, and its civilian airport is also used by the Iranian air force.

0,"A senior Iranian official said Wednesday that Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter detained in Tehran nearly two months ago, is being interrogated on unspecified charges by judicial authorities. “He is facing interrogation in Iran for what he has done as an Iranian citizen,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in an interview with NPR. Zarif did not say why Rezaian, a dual American and Iranian citizen, was arrested or what charges he may be facing. He said Iran’s judiciary has “no obligation to explain” any charges to the United States. “His lawyers know. He knows his charge. I’m not supposed to know, but he knows his charge,” Zarif said, adding that the judiciary operates independently. The Iranian government has said little about Rezaian’s case since he was detained July 22, and according to his family, he has not had access to a lawyer. His wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, and two others, a photojournalist and her husband, were arrested at the same time. Only Rezaian and Salehi are still being held. The other two, whom The Post has not named at the request of their families, have been released. Zarif, who is in New York for negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, said he knows Rezaian personally and hopes for his release. “I know him to be a fair reporter, so I had hoped all along that his detention would be short, and I continued to try to make it shorter, [rather] than longer,” he told NPR. “But the point that needs to be made is that an Iranian citizen is being held by Iranian authorities on suspicions dealing with Iranian law.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and other world leaders are gathering next week in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. Zarif is also participating in negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program with the United States and five other major powers. The State Department has called on Iran to release Rezaian and his wife, and The Post has said it does not know what charges Rezaian might be facing. “The two have been held for more than eight weeks without explanation or charges,” Douglas Jehl, The Post’s foreign editor, said in a statement. “The two are fully accredited journalists, and we remain mystified by their detention and deeply concerned about their welfare.” Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, and Rezaian’s family have said that Rezaian’s health is of particular concern. He has high blood pressure, which requires him to take medication daily. “The authorities ... have conducted a two-month-long investigation from which they have produced no evidence of wrongdoing by either Jason or Yeganeh,” Rezaian’s older brother, Ali, said in a statement. “Neither I nor my mother have been permitted any communication with Jason. We remain concerned about their health and implore the Iranian authorities to release them in compliance with Iran’s existing laws and constitution.”","A senior Iranian official said Wednesday that Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter detained in Tehran nearly two months ago, is being interrogated on unspecified charges by judicial authorities. “He is facing interrogation in Iran for what he has done as an Iranian citizen,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in an interview with NPR.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Army Staff Sgt. Angel M. Sanchez, 30, offered the plea before the start of the military judicial hearing. Sanchez is accused of using his supervisory position with the 14th Military Police Brigade to threaten some of the women he was tasked with training. The incidents reportedly took place in the bathroom of the female barracks as well as in an office shared by drill sergeants. Most of the allegations involved women at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, but some involved women in Afghanistan and Fort Richardson, Alaska. Sanchez also served one tour in Iraq, where he earned a Bronze Star and two other combat medals before arriving at the Missouri post in August 2013. Sanchez remains accused of two dozen violations involving sexual assault and abusive sexual contact. Several additional accusations against Sanchez were dismissed after a pretrial hearing. Ernesto Gapasin, Sanchez’s attorney, said before the plea that the dismissals signaled an overzealous prosecution. — Associated Press NEW YORK Arab Bank is found liable for attacks A U.S. jury found on Monday that a large Jordan-based bank should be held responsible for a wave of Hamas-sanctioned suicide bombings in the early 2000s that left several Americans dead or wounded. Jurors reached the unanimous verdict in a terrorism financing lawsuit against Arab Bank after deliberating two days in a civil trial in federal court in Brooklyn. Plaintiff’s lawyer Gary Osen said it’s the first time a bank has been found liable for knowingly supporting a terrorist group. An attorney for the bank, Shand Stephens, predicts the verdict will be overturned on appeal based on “errors in admission of evidence, errors in jury instructions and errors in imposing sanctions.” The five-week trial addressed only the question of liability. Whether the bank should face damages will be decided by another jury. The civil case marked the first time a bank had faced a trial under the Anti-Terrorism Act, which allows victims of U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations to seek compensation. — Associated Press TEXAS Gov. Perry asks to miss a court date Attorneys for indicted Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) asked Monday that he be allowed to skip his next court appearance because he’ll be out the country — and that he not be forced to attend subsequent pretrial hearings where no evidence is presented. In a five-page motion, Perry’s defense team asked a judge to excuse the governor from a hearing scheduled for Oct. 13 due to “long-standing plans to be in Europe” for an Oct. 12-19 tour to encourage foreign investment in Texas. It added, “The governor’s presence in court — along with his security detail — will involve a not insubstantial disruption of the normal operating functions” of the courthouse in Travis County, which includes Austin. The motion said that if Perry is compelled to appear, the hearing should be delayed until at least until Oct. 20. An Austin grand jury indicted Perry last month on two felony counts of abuse of power for threatening to veto state funding for a public corruption investigative unit. The governor issued the promised veto after the Democratic district attorney who oversees the unit refused to resign following her drunken-driving conviction — drawing an ethics complaint against Perry from a left-leaning watchdog group. — Associated Press Seattle drops tickets issued by anti-pot cop: Seattle’s elected prosecutor said Monday he’s dropping all tickets issued for the public use of marijuana through the first seven months of this year, because most of them were issued by a single police officer who disagrees with the legal pot law.

0,"NEW YORK — The jailing of a Washington Post reporter without public charges in Iran is not evidence of a power struggle between moderate and conservative political forces, Iran’s president said Tuesday. President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, expressed optimism that the generally conservative Iranian judiciary would “comport itself in a fair manner” in the case of reporter Jason Rezaian and his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, who was also arrested. “I do not believe this was something preprogrammed against my administration,” Rouhani said Tuesday. Rouhani called for a “resolute fight” against Islamic State militants but denounced the U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria as violations of international law and unwelcome Western interference in the Middle East. He expressed hope for a comprehensive accord with world powers that would govern Iran’s nuclear program, although prospects for an agreement before a November deadline have appeared dim. Rouhani spoke to U.S. editors and reporters ahead of his address to the U.N. General Assembly this week. The annual U.N. gathering is the only time an Iranian leader is allowed to visit the United States, and the Shiite power broker and U.S. adversary has routinely used the platform to explain its foreign policy and tweak American leaders. A meeting with President Obama is unlikely this year, Rouhani said. Such a meeting would be historic after more than three decades of enmity between Tehran and Washington. Obama called Rouhani during last year’s General Assembly and has said he would be open to a meeting under the right circumstances. Rouhani is considered a political reformer, and he charmed some in the United States last year with cordial political overtures and a pledge to work for better relations. He has at least a limited mandate from Iran’s supreme religious leader to pursue a deal that would curb the country’s nuclear program, which the West sees as deeply suspect, in exchange for the lifting of crippling international sanctions. Iranian hard-liners are skeptical of the negotiations and Rouhani’s intentions. That internal political tension has led to speculation that Rezaian’s arrest was an attempt by hard-liners to embarrass Rouhani before his visit to New York and complicate chances for the nuclear accord. Rezaian has been detained by the judiciary, Rouhani said, which has “not yet made a determination” about his case. He said he was “hopeful and quite optimistic” that the judiciary would resolve the case fairly. Rezaian is a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen, but Iran has refused to allow diplomats representing the United States to visit him since he and Salehi were detained July 22. Iran does not recognize dual citizenship, considering anyone holding an Iranian passport to be Iranian only. The Iranian government has said little about Rezaian’s case since he was picked up in Tehran. Rezaian and Salehi have not been permitted access to a lawyer, according to Rezaian’s family. His mother and brother say they have not been allowed to communicate with him. In the interview Tuesday, Rouhani suggested that Iran has worked aggressively to fight “terrorists” in the region. The United States has sought at least a tacit commitment from Iran to play a helpful role in confronting Islamic State militants, but Rouhani did not make any commitment. “Terrorist and extreme violence is a serious threat for all of us,” he said. “These groups need a resolute fight to be carried out against them.” Iran is a leading opponent of the Sunni-led militants but is unwilling to line up with an international coalition that is led by Washington and that includes Tehran’s regional rivals, such as Saudi Arabia. “Who is best qualified to lead such a coalition?” Rouhani asked. “Is it possible to do so without knowing the Middle East region extremely well?” He added that the U.S.-led attacks in Syria “do not have any legal standing” without U.N. approval. Iran is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and must now calibrate its policies to balance its desire to defeat the Islamic State against its interests in keeping Assad in power. U.S. and Iranian diplomats are meeting this week on the stalled nuclear accord, amid wide pessimism that Iran is willing to accept the deep cuts to its uranium-enrichment that the West demands. Rouhani expressed hope for a deal but said that his country must be able to “maintain a peaceful nuclear program” — a reference to uranium enrichment. Iran insists that it does not seek a nuclear weapon and that it produces nuclear fuel to power reactors for energy production and medical research. The West and its allies fear that Iran could use its enrichment program to someday create warhead-grade nuclear material. Rouhani acknowledged that U.S. and international sanctions have squeezed his nation’s economy but said Iran has been able to soften the blow through stepped-up trade with countries that disregard the measures. China and central Asian nations, for example, have boosted their economic links with Iran. “Is this to the benefit of the American economy, the American people, the world at large?” he said, calling the sanctions “inhumane and against human rights.” Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this report.","NEW YORK — The jailing of a Washington Post reporter without public charges in Iran is not evidence of a power struggle between moderate and conservative political forces, Iran’s president said Tuesday.

0,"NEW YORK — Iran’s president would not promise Wednesday to intervene in or to speed up the legal case against a Washington Post reporter who has been detained in that country for more than two months. Hassan Rouhani did not reveal what charges reporter Jason Rezaian may face or give any details about his detention. Rezaian and his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, were arrested in Tehran on July 22. “The individual who you name is being investigated. He is in detention being investigated. During this time a multitude of things can change,” Rouhani said during a forum sponsored by the New America Foundation. “At a time when a file, a case, is being built and the prosecutor is working hard to send that case file to the appropriate court,” it is inappropriate to discuss charges, Rouhani said. Charges would be announced when the file is referred to court, he said. A swift resolution of the case and leniency for Rezaian are matters that can be discussed only “after the final judgment has been rendered,” Rouhani said through an interpreter. “Any individual who is brought up on any charges or detained, all these steps must be in accordance with the laws of the country,” Rouhani said. “We must not prematurely express any opinions about a case file that has not reached the court yet.” Rouhani noted that the executive branch of government he heads can sometimes inquire about the circumstances of someone’s detention, a reference that may have been an oblique way of saying he intends to weigh in on a case that has embarrassed his nominally reform-minded administration. But when pressed, Rouhani would not pledge to make any such intercession in Rezaian’s case. Rouhani expressed optimism that his nation can reach an accord with world powers over its nuclear program, and said that while he and President Obama may be able to cooperate on many issues in the future, resolution of the nuclear issue must come first. “There is a saying in Farsi that goes something like, ‘Let’s raise this baby that we just gave birth to before we go on to number two,’ ” Rouhani said. Rouhani is in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly, which he is scheduled to address on Thursday. The Iranian leader was elected last year amid high hopes for political reform and a possible deal to resolve years of international concerns about whether Iran is seeking the ability to build a nuclear weapon. Those negotiations have bogged down, and many are skeptical about a comprehensive deal being agreed upon by the November deadline. Iranian and U.S. diplomats blame one another. Earlier Wednesday, Obama said the United States seeks a diplomatic resolution of the standoff with Iran over a program Iran says is entirely peaceful and aimed at energy production. “This can only take place if Iran seizes this historic opportunity,” Obama said during his address to the United Nations. “My message to Iran’s leaders and people has been simple and consistent: Do not let this opportunity pass.

1,"For more than 10 years, Iran has been my son Jason Rezaian’s focus. In that time, while other Americans and dual Iranian American citizens spent days, weeks or months in Iran researching, teaching, filming or reporting, no other full-time American reporters were based there, to his knowledge. No others remained, year after year, dealing with the traffic, pollution and bureaucracy of Tehran, learning the language and how to thrive there. Jason did it because he loves Iran and wanted to walk in his ancestors’ footsteps. His goal as a journalist is to dispel myths each country has about the other, first as a freelancer and now as The Post’s correspondent in Tehran. The disputes between the United States and Iran have gone on for more than three decades. Suspicion runs deep on both sides. Jason was working to promote understanding. Now he has been silenced. For two months, Jason and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, both credentialed journalists, have been held without being charged. By Iranian law, they are not allowed access to an attorney. This detention is taking a terrible toll, both physical and mental, on them and their families. Does Iran wish to reinforce the skepticism and suspicion long held against it? Does it want to be viewed as an unsafe place to do business? While the world is paying attention, Iran should demonstrate to the doubters that it is a country of laws and follows its constitution. This cruel detention is hurting Jason and Yeganeh, it is hurting our families and it is hurting Iran. Please, release them to their mothers. Allow them to walk free.  Mary Breme Rezaian, Istanbul ● In the two months since their detention, we have had little information about the condition of our daughter, Yeganeh Salehi, and her husband, Jason Rezaian. We still do not know on what charges they are being held. In the short time we were allowed to see them recently, we learned that they do not know why they are being held but are certain of their innocence. They worry about their fate. Despite our poor health, my husband and I go to the court and prison every day in hopes of finding out news about them. We have gone through a torturous two months. All we have heard from authorities is that their case is in the preliminary investigation stage. What have two reporters, whose passion has always been fair reporting and who have always abided by the law, done to warrant a two-month investigation? If they have done something wrong, why aren’t they being charged? Why is their fate up in the air? With utmost respect for the authorities and with the aim of having the voice of our families, who have endured much pain and suffered greatly, heard, I implore Iranian officials to do everything in their power to get Jason and Yeganeh released. We have found every door closed.  Fatemeh Talaei, Tehran","For more than 10 years, Iran has been my son Jason Rezaian’s focus.

His goal as a journalist is to dispel myths each country has about the other, first as a freelancer and now as The Post’s correspondent in Tehran. The disputes between the United States and Iran have gone on for more than three decades. Suspicion runs deep on both sides. Jason was working to promote understanding. Now he has been silenced. For two months, Jason and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, both credentialed journalists, have been held without being charged. By Iranian law, they are not allowed access to an attorney. This detention is taking a terrible toll, both physical and mental, on them and their families. Does Iran wish to reinforce the skepticism and suspicion long held against it? Does it want to be viewed as an unsafe place to do business? While the world is paying attention, Iran should demonstrate to the doubters that it is a country of laws and follows its constitution. This cruel detention is hurting Jason and Yeganeh, it is hurting our families and it is hurting Iran. Please, release them to their mothers. Allow them to walk free.  Mary Breme Rezaian, Istanbul ● In the two months since their detention, we have had little information about the condition of our daughter, Yeganeh Salehi, and her husband, Jason Rezaian. We still do not know on what charges they are being held. In the short time we were allowed to see them recently, we learned that they do not know why they are being held but are certain of their innocence. They worry about their fate. Despite our poor health, my husband and I go to the court and prison every day in hopes of finding out news about them. We have gone through a torturous two months. All we have heard from authorities is that their case is in the preliminary investigation stage. What have two reporters, whose passion has always been fair reporting and who have always abided by the law, done to warrant a two-month investigation? If they have done something wrong, why aren’t they being charged? Why is their fate up in the air? With utmost respect for the authorities and with the aim of having the voice of our families, who have endured much pain and suffered greatly, heard, I implore Iranian officials to do everything in their power to get Jason and Yeganeh released. We have found every door closed.  Fatemeh Talaei, Tehran"
0,"An Iranian journalist detained in Iran since July along with her husband, The Washington Post’s bureau chief in Tehran, has been released from custody, a family member said Sunday. While Yeganeh Salehi was freed on bail in the middle of last week, her husband, Jason Rezaian, remains imprisoned, his brother, Ali, wrote in an e-mail. Salehi succeeded in visiting Rezaian over the weekend and said that she and her husband are “physically healthy” despite being in custody for 21 / 2 months, Ali Rezaian said. There have been concerns about Rezaian’s health because he has high blood pressure and must take medication daily. As first disclosed to the National, an Abu Dhabi-based newspaper for which Salehi was working in Iran, she now does not have accreditation to work as a journalist in Iran. Neither she nor her family in Tehran will be speaking to the media about their detentions, Ali Rezaian said, and he asked for their privacy to be respected. “We are thankful Yeganeh has been released on bail,” said a statement by her family. “We remain confident that Jason has committed no crime. We pray that the Iranian government will conclude that Jason should be released as well.” Rezaian and Salehi were arrested July 22 amid murky circumstances. A photojournalist and her husband also were arrested, but they have been released. Iran has never stated why Rezaian, 38, a dual American and Iranian citizen, and his wife were arrested or what charges they are facing, but Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told NPR last month that Rezaian was being interrogated “for what he has done as an Iranian citizen.” Neither their families nor the Post have been given any further explanation. The State Department has called for the release of Rezaian and the others, and also asked about their condition through Switzerland, which acts as an ­intermediary since Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Tehran. But Iran does not recognize dual nationality and maintains that the United States has no right to weigh in on the arrest of people holding U.S. and Iranian passports. Douglas Jehl, the foreign editor of The Post, urged Iran to release Rezaian soon. “We’re relieved that Yeganeh Salehi is home with her family in Tehran after more than 10 weeks in government detention,” Jehl said in a statement. “But Jason Rezaian, The Post’s Tehran correspondent, is still being held without explanation, as he has been since July 22. It is long past time for the Iranian authorities to release Jason and to permit him and Yegi to leave the country.” In a letter to the editor last month, Salehi’s mother, Fatemeh Talaei, said neither her daughter nor her son-in-law knew why they were being held. Rezaian’s mother, Mary Breme Rezaian, wrote in a separate letter published along with the one from Talaei that her son had been writing about Iran for a decade to promote more understanding between the United States and Iran. “Jason did it because he loves Iran and wanted to walk in his ancestors’ footsteps,” she wrote. “His goal as a journalist is to dispel myths each country has about the other, first as a free­lancer and now as The Post’s correspondent in Tehran.”","An Iranian journalist detained in Iran since July along with her husband, The Washington Post’s bureau chief in Tehran, has been released from custody, a family member said Sunday.

1,"The family of a Washington Post reporter held without charge in Iran for more than three months called Wednesday on the authorities in Tehran to free him. An open letter signed by Jason Rezaian’s brother, Ali, and his mother, Mary Breme Rezaian, was released 100 days after Rezaian was arrested under still-vague circumstances, along with his wife and another couple. Rezaian’s family said he is being held in solitary confinement in the notorious Evin prison, which houses common criminals as well as dissidents, intellectuals and journalists. Because no charges have been brought against him, Rezaian has been prohibited from hiring a lawyer, his family said. “If Iran has any evidence against Jason then why have we not heard of it?” the family statement said. “If, after 100 days, Iran’s professionally trained and liberally employed interrogators have found evidence against Jason then why has he not been charged and permitted to employ an attorney and defend himself? “. . . After 100 days, it’s time for Iran to concede Jason’s innocence and release him.” Rezaian, 38, is The Post’s correspondent in Tehran. He holds dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship. The State Department has called for his release and asked about his condition through the intermediary country of Switzerland; the United States and Iran do not have diplomatic relations. But Iran does not recognize dual nationality and dismisses any U.S. right to have a say in the case. Rezaian and his wife, an Iranian journalist, were arrested together with another couple on July 22. All but Rezaian, who requires daily medication to treat his high blood pressure, have been released. Rezaian’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, was freed on bail this month. “It is inexplicable and utterly unacceptable that Jason Rezaian, the Post’s Tehran correspondent, remains in Iranian custody,” said Douglas Jehl, The Post’s foreign editor. “After 100 days, the time is long overdue for the Iranian authorities to release Jason and to allow him to be reunited with his family.” Iran has never publicly stated the grounds for the arrests orwhat specific accusations Rezaian faces. “Unfortunately, they have been involved in activities which our security people consider . . . activities definitely beyond journalism,” Mohammed Javad Larijani, head of the judiciary’s human rights council, said in a CNN interview Wednesday. “Accusations — when it is considered as substantial and capable of being prosecuted by law, it becomes charges,” he added. “So it was not pure accusations.” Larijani said that charges will be explained during the court process and that Rezaian and others will “have ample opportunity to defend themselves.” Larijani, the son of an important ayatollah, has frequently defended Iran to Western audiences, including on the subject of the country’s growing number of executions for drug crimes. Since Salehi was released three weeks ago, she has visited Rezaian several times, according to his brother. He has not seen a doctor during his confinement despite family requests that he have access to a physician to ensure he has no long-term ailments, Ali Rezaian said. The lengthy detention, he added, makes him “hopeful that leaders higher up in Iran will see the absurdity of holding Jason for this long, given that there has never been any public mention of any evidence against him.”","The family of a Washington Post reporter held without charge in Iran for more than three months called Wednesday on the authorities in Tehran to free him.

0,"When Erin Satterfield wanted to capture a moment from her recent tour of the Capitol building, she did so in the most modern of ways: She reached into her pocket, pulled out her smartphone and snapped a picture of herself. Satterfield liked the photo so much she thought to make it her professional headshot on LinkedIn. There was just one issue: She wanted her face to appear a bit slimmer. So Satterfield once again turned to her smartphone — and an app called Photox. The brainchild of a former politico from Northern Virginia, Photox (pronounced like Botox) allows users to submit candid photos to a team of editors who will give it a touch up — or overhaul — depending on what changes the subject wants to see made. The edits can range from minor tweaks, such as teeth whitening or eye color correction, to near-surgical changes, including breast and butt enhancements, full-body weight loss and bald spot coverup. “It’s incredibly empowering to be able to have control over how you’re portrayed online,” Satterfield said. “That’s one of the best things about Photox, it empowers you to do that and be able to put the best version of yourself forward.” The use of photo editing software to manipulate images in advertisements and on magazine covers is all but guaranteed. Models and celebrities alike have their waists slimmed, their breasts augmented or their skin smoothed to achieve a particular look. But the practice is now working its way into our most-candid moments. From family portraits to spontaneous selfies, the images people post to their social networks are increasingly altered to cultivate the image we want people to see — reality be damned. Photox founder Louisa Imperiale developed the app after her own Photoshop moment. Imperiale’s husband took a photo of her holding their newborn daughter, but the touching scene was tarnished by a bra strap sticking out from her medical robe. “Something silly like that can really mar a once-in-a-lifetime photo,” she said. Once a user uploads his or her photo to the app, they are presented with more than 30 editing options. Each edit requires a certain number of credits, and each credit costs 99 cents. Removing a tattoo or scar requires one credit, or 99 cents. Erasing the photo’s background runs nine credits, or $8.91. “We have a lot of people using a photo from their family vacation as a LinkedIn headshot and you would never know it was taken at a restaurant or on the beach,” Imperiale said. If you haven’t been hitting the gym lately, Photox can add six-pack abs ($3.96), give you skinny legs ($3.96) or bulk-up your arms ($2.97). If it’s a dermatologist you desire, the app can also minimize wrinkles ($2.97), lighten skin ($3.96) and remove acne (99 cents). Photox isn’t without competition. Most camera apps now offer filters that can make images more vibrant or softer on the eye. Adobe has also released mobile versions of its widely used Photoshop software for those who want to edit on the go. But Imperiale said Photox is different primarily because it connects people with a team of experienced photo editors who can alter images as quickly and naturally as possible. “You really do have to have the artistic expertise and ability to do it, and you also have to have the technical skills to be able to do it,” she said. Imperiale recognizes there are critics of rampant photo editing. Many assert it perpetuates an ideal but unattainable body image, and some photography purists argue it bends the truth too far. But she said Photox appeals to a particular clientele, primarily women, who have money to spend and a desire to control their image online for reasons that range from professional to superficial. “Our customers aren’t teenagers who share absolutely everything on social media,” Imperiale said. “Our customers are older, a little more contentious, and very deliberate about what they’re putting out there on social media.” “People spend a lot of time obsessing about things that no one else cares about,” she continued. “For some reason, I always raise one eyebrow in photos, but it’s something only I would ever notice. So with Photox, if you’ve got something like that, some fault finding in your own pictures, you can fix it and stop worrying about it.” Melissa Conner wanted a photo with her husband after a recent wedding while the pair were still dressed in formal attire. She got the picture, but the lighting was harsh, there was a glare in his eyeglasses and the angle wasn’t flattering for her face. Conner, who went to college with Imperiale, submitted the picture to Photox with those complaints. The end result now sits on the desk in her office. “I thought it was just going to be one of those [photos] you delete and they made it worthy of framing,” Conner said.

1,"A senior Iranian official has suggested Iran may be considering the release of a Washington Post reporter jailed for over 100 days without charges. Hopes that Jason Rezaian may be freed soon were bolstered Friday when Mohammad Javad Larijani, head of the human rights council of Iran’s judiciary, told a New York Times reporter in Geneva that the state security service had finally prepared charges against the Post’s Tehran bureau chief. Under the Iranian legal system, Rezaian has been prohibited from hiring a lawyer because no charges have officially been brought against him yet. Larijani said the impending charges revolve around activities “entering the area of the security of the state,” the Times reported in a story posted on its Web site late Friday night. But Larijani said court proceedings might occur “soon,” when he hoped that the charges would be dismissed. “We, as the Council of Human Rights, requested a review of the charges before going to the court procedure,” said Larijani, who comes from a politically influential family in Iran. “As the court procedure is elaborate, it takes time. So the prosecutor was kind enough to take a second review, so we hope the charges will be dropped.” His remarks on Rezaian were not made during a formal session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, where Larijani defended Iran amid harsh criticism of its human rights record. Rather, he spoke to a Times reporter after the session in what the publication described as a brief interview. Though Larijani’s comments were somewhat speculative, they offered reason for optimism over the fate of Rezaian, who was arrested July 22. Previously, Larijani has brushed off calls from U.S. officials, The Post and Rezaian’s family to release the journalist. Rezaian is a dual American and Iranian national. Since Iran does not recognize dual citizenship, officials in Tehran contend the United States has no right to get involved in the case. There have been concerns about how incarceration is affecting the health of Rezaian, 38, who takes medication to control high blood pressure. His wife, an Iranian journalist who was arrested along with him, is the only outsider known to have visited him since she was freed early last month. This past week, both the State Department and Rezaian’s family issued statements urging Iran to free him since he has not yet been charged him after more than 100 days of detention and interrogation. Late Friday night, Rezaian’s brother and mother released another statement saying they were heartened by Larijani’s comments. “We are hopeful that his review of the accusations will reveal once and for all what we have always known, Jason is innocent,” said the statement by Ali Rezaian and their mother, Mary Breme Rezaian. “After 100 days in detention and no evidence, surely Mr. Larijani agrees. We share in Mr. Larijani’s hope that any accusations will be dropped promptly and without need for a trial.” “We are heartened by the suggestion from Iran’s human rights chief that any charges against The Post’s Jason Rezaian might be dropped,” Post foreign editor Douglas Jehl said. “Jason never should have been detained, and it is time for the prosecutor to join Iran’s Human Rights Council in calling for his release.”","A senior Iranian official has suggested Iran may be considering the release of a Washington Post reporter jailed for over 100 days without charges.

1,"Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who has been detained in Iran since July without trial, could be released in less than a month, according to a senior Iranian official. Mohammed Javad Larijani, who heads Iran’s human rights council and is a top adviser to the country’s supreme leader, said in an interview Monday with the Euronews television channel that security officials have now filed charges against Rezaian alleging “that he was involved in activities beyond journalism.” Larijani said that meant activity “which breaches the security of the state,” but he offered no specifics. Larijani said in English that the fate of Rezaian, 38, who has dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, is up to Iranian judicial authorities, but he expressed hope that the case against him could soon be dropped.  [Read the transcript of the interview with Mohammad Javad Larijani.]  “My hope is that before going to the court process, the prosecutor could be content to drop the case to see that maybe the accusations are not quite substantial,” Larijani said, according to a Euro­news transcript of the interview provided to The Washington Post. He also said it was possible that the court could pardon Rezaian “and totally drop all the charges,” adding, “Then everything is finished.” Asked when the case might be resolved, Larijani said, “Well, I anticipate in less than a month.” Euronews, which is based in France, said the interview would be aired in full Friday. Larijani made similar comments in an interview with the New York Times last week. Rezaian was arrested July 22 along with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, and another couple. Salehi was freed early last month. Rezaian has been prohibited from hiring a lawyer on grounds that no formal charges have yet been filed against him. Last week, Rezaian’s family called on authorities in Tehran to free him, citing a lack of any evidence against him and expressing concerns for his health. Rezaian, who needs medication to control high blood pressure, is being held in solitary confinement in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, his family said. On Thursday, Rezaian’s mother, Mary Rezaian, released a video statement repeating that plea. “I wake up every morning awaiting a phone call, an e-mail, or even a knock at the door with news that Jason has been released, but there has been no news,” she said in the video. She added: “I speak directly to those with the power to release my son, Jason Rezaian — enough is enough. You have had 100 days to know my sweet boy, and surely by now you know what his family and friends have always told you: Jason is a good, kind man who loves Iran and its people.” Citing unidentified sources, the Voice of America reported Wednesday that Rezaian’s physical and mental health have deteriorated since the release of his wife. The U.S. government-owned broadcaster said Rezaian has “several untreated health issues, including a serious eye infection that doctors were concerned could lead to blindness.” In an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday, Rezaian’s brother, Ali Rezaian, repeatedly expressed concern for his brother’s health. While saying his brother has not been “physically mistreated,” he noted that he has been kept in solitary confinement throughout his detention. “I’m really concerned about his health,” Ali Rezaian said. “I’m concerned about his back, about his eyes, about his depression.” With his brother’s imprisonment stretching beyond 100 days, Ali Rezaian said he was beginning to worry “that it’s getting to a point where there could be long-term damage.” He said he had been told that Rezaian “did get to see an eye doctor yesterday,” but that his mental health had suffered since his wife’s release. In the Euronews interview, Larijani, whose brother, Sadegh Larijani, heads Iran’s judicial system, answered vaguely when pressed on the reason for Rezaian’s detention. “These charges considered by the prosecutor of the case are enough to detain him. . . . So this prosecutor detained him and again renewed his detention because the file was not ready, but I think this dossier is approaching completion,” Larijani said. He added: “I expect that his case will come to a rather final stage. Either he will be totally discharged or it will go the court, and the court will make a final decision.”","Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who has been detained in Iran since July without trial, could be released in less than a month, according to a senior Iranian official.

[Read the transcript of the interview with Mohammad Javad Larijani.]  “My hope is that before going to the court process, the prosecutor could be content to drop the case to see that maybe the accusations are not quite substantial,” Larijani said, according to a Euro­news transcript of the interview provided to The Washington Post. He also said it was possible that the court could pardon Rezaian “and totally drop all the charges,” adding, “Then everything is finished.” Asked when the case might be resolved, Larijani said, “Well, I anticipate in less than a month.” Euronews, which is based in France, said the interview would be aired in full Friday. Larijani made similar comments in an interview with the New York Times last week. Rezaian was arrested July 22 along with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, and another couple. Salehi was freed early last month. Rezaian has been prohibited from hiring a lawyer on grounds that no formal charges have yet been filed against him. Last week, Rezaian’s family called on authorities in Tehran to free him, citing a lack of any evidence against him and expressing concerns for his health. Rezaian, who needs medication to control high blood pressure, is being held in solitary confinement in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, his family said. On Thursday, Rezaian’s mother, Mary Rezaian, released a video statement repeating that plea. “I wake up every morning awaiting a phone call, an e-mail, or even a knock at the door with news that Jason has been released, but there has been no news,” she said in the video. She added: “I speak directly to those with the power to release my son, Jason Rezaian — enough is enough. You have had 100 days to know my sweet boy, and surely by now you know what his family and friends have always told you: Jason is a good, kind man who loves Iran and its people.” Citing unidentified sources, the Voice of America reported Wednesday that Rezaian’s physical and mental health have deteriorated since the release of his wife. The U.S. government-owned broadcaster said Rezaian has “several untreated health issues, including a serious eye infection that doctors were concerned could lead to blindness.” In an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday, Rezaian’s brother, Ali Rezaian, repeatedly expressed concern for his brother’s health. While saying his brother has not been “physically mistreated,” he noted that he has been kept in solitary confinement throughout his detention. “I’m really concerned about his health,” Ali Rezaian said. “I’m concerned about his back, about his eyes, about his depression.” With his brother’s imprisonment stretching beyond 100 days, Ali Rezaian said he was beginning to worry “that it’s getting to a point where there could be long-term damage.” He said he had been told that Rezaian “did get to see an eye doctor yesterday,” but that his mental health had suffered since his wife’s release. In the Euronews interview, Larijani, whose brother, Sadegh Larijani, heads Iran’s judicial system, answered vaguely when pressed on the reason for Rezaian’s detention. “These charges considered by the prosecutor of the case are enough to detain him. . . . So this prosecutor detained him and again renewed his detention because the file was not ready, but I think this dossier is approaching completion,” Larijani said. He added: “I expect that his case will come to a rather final stage. Either he will be totally discharged or it will go the court, and the court will make a final decision.”"

This article has been updated to note that information about Rezaian’s detention comes from several sources. Iran’s detention of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian has been extended for up to an additional 60 days, according to his family. Hopes that Rezaian, who has been held without charge at Tehran’s Evin prison for 134 days, might be released soon were bolstered at the end of October, when a senior Iranian official said in an interview that possible charges under review by the judiciary might be dismissed. Instead, his family said, Rezaian was shown a document last week signed by the judge in charge of his case that authorized the extension. The document, dated Nov. 18, said the investigation against him was ongoing. According to Human Rights Watch, detaining authorities can hold a suspect indefinitely and deny him access to counsel with the approval of a judge. Communication with Rezaian has been primarily through his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who has been allowed to visit him once or twice a week. Salehi, who is also a journalist, was arrested with him on July 22, the day after his press credentials were renewed by Iran’s Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. She was released in early October. Rezaian is a dual American and Iranian national, but Iran does not recognize dual citizenship. Although his family in the United States has retained a lawyer, he has not been allowed to meet with Rezaian. Mohammed Javad Larijani, head of the human rights council of Iran’s judiciary, said in a New York Times interview in Geneva more than a month ago that the state security service had prepared charges against the Post’s Tehran bureau chief revolving around activities “entering the area of the security of the state.” He said court proceedings might occur “soon,” when he hoped that the charges would be dismissed. Ali Rezaian, Jason Rezaian’s brother, said in a telephone interview Thursday that “there seems to be a disconnect” between elements of the Iranian government. “Clearly, this isn’t something that we wanted,” he said. His brother has now been held “longer than any other credentialed Western journalist in the past,” Ali Rezaian said. “There have not been any charges against him, and there is no reason to think he is guilty of anything.” “We have never had a clear view of why Jason is being held, how long he would be held, what might lead to his release, or when. We still don’t,” said Post Executive Editor Martin Baron. “The key thing to remember is that he should never have been arrested and imprisoned in the first place, and he should be released immediately. There was no legitimate reason for him to be held without charges or explanation for more than four months. We again urge the Iranian authorities to give him his freedom and allow him to reunite with his family.” Ali Rezaian said his family has become increasingly worried about his brother’s health, including persistent infections in his eye and groin, and difficulty walking. “His depression is getting much worse,” Ali Rezaian said, “just because it’s been so long. This is really unprecedented, what they’re doing.”","Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Mohammed Javad Larijani, head of the Iranian judiciary’s human rights council.

0,"Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who has been detained in Iran for more than four months, was officially charged Saturday in a day-long proceeding in a Tehran courtroom, according to a source familiar with the case. The specifics of the charges are still unknown, at least to those not present in the courtroom. The court appearance came two days after word arrived in the West that Rezaian’s detention has been extended until mid-January because the investigation against him is continuing. The charges were the first lodged since Rezaian, an Iranian American who holds dual citizenship, was arrested July 22. His family has hired a lawyer for him, but the attorney has not been permitted to visit him. The State Department has repeatedly raised the case of Rezaian, and other Americans jailed in Iran, during lengthy talks with the Tehran government about a deal to curb Iran’s nuclear capacity and ease international sanctions. The source said Rezaian spent about 10 hours in court Saturday while a judge reviewed his case. A translator accompanied Rezaian, who does not read Farsi, said the source, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case. Rezaian signed a document saying he understood that he was being charged, the source said. The proceedings appear to dash any hope that Rezaian could be freed in the near future. It could take as long as a month for the charges to be delivered to the full court, which would then set a trial date, the source said. Theoretically, at that point Rezaian’s attorney would be permitted to review the charges and might be allowed to speak with his client, the source said. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, in a statement issued early Sunday, said that the “Iranian government continues to deny our repeated requests for Consular Access to Jason by our Protecting Power, the Swiss, so we are unable to check on his condition or ensure adequate legal representation.” Kerry said he had “repeatedly raised Jason’s case, and the other cases of detained or missing U.S. citizens, directly with Iranian officials. “Jason poses no threat to the Iranian government or to Iran’s national security. We call on the Iranian government to drop any and all charges against Jason and release him immediately so that he can be reunited with his family,” Kerry said. There are divergent views in Iran about the arrest of Rezaian, who has been The Post’s bureau chief in Tehran since 2012. In a recent interview with France 24 television, the secretary of Iran’s Human Rights Council, Mohammad Javad Larijani, said he hoped that Rezaian’s case will be presented to the court “as soon as possible. . . . Let us hope that this fiasco will end on good terms.” Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron expressed outrage Saturday over Rezaian’s continued detention. Rezaian’s family is concerned about the effect the imprisonment may have on his health, as he has high blood pressure, multiple infections, back issues and emotional stress caused by his lengthy time in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison. “We are dismayed and outraged by reports that Jason ­Rezaian, The Post’s correspondent in Iran, has now been charged with unspecified crimes,” Baron said in a statement. “The Iranian government has never explained why Jason was detained or why he has been held for more than four months without access to a lawyer. Jason is an American citizen who was acting as a fully accredited journalist. If he has indeed been charged, we know that any fair legal proceeding would quickly determine that any allegations against him are baseless.” Rezaian was arrested with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, also a journalist, but she was released on bail early in October.

The specific charges are unknown. Kerry said Sunday he also was distressed that Rezaian has not been allowed to speak to a lawyer hired by his family, which Kerry called a “clear violation of Iran’s own laws and international norms.” Rezaian’s brother, Ali Rezaian, said in an interview Sunday that Iranian authorities have “bent over backwards to bend and break their own rules to keep him in jail longer.” Rezaian’s family also issued a statement saying, “Our family is deeply saddened.” The statement continued: “In its ongoing disregard of Iran’s own laws, the Iranian judiciary has continued to deny Jason access to legal representation, denied his request for bail, and prevented access to review of his case file. “This continued disrespect for Iran’s judicial system should be a concern not only to the international community who are eagerly awaiting normalization of relations with Iran, but also to all those Iranians who claim that Iran is a country of laws which should be recognized as such by major world powers.” Kerry and other State Department officials have raised Rezaian’s case, and those of other Americans detained in Iran, in negotiations with Iran over a potential deal to decrease Iran’s nuclear capacity in exchange for an easing of international sanctions. “I am personally dismayed and disturbed at these reports as I have repeatedly raised Jason’s case, and the other cases of detained or missing U.S. citizens, directly with Iranian officials,” Kerry said in a statement posted on the State Department’s Web site. He noted that the Iranian government has denied repeated requests for Switzerland, which represents U.S. interests in Iran, to visit Rezaian, making it impossible to check on his physical condition and ensure that he is receiving legal advice. “Jason poses no threat to the Iranian government or to Iran’s national security,” Kerry said. “We call on the Iranian government to drop any and all charges against Jason and release him immediately so that he can be reunited with his family.” The months Rezaian has spent in prison have taken a physical and emotional toll, Ali Rezaian said. He has developed multiple infections that the family is concerned could cause permanent damage if untreated. He has seen a doctor twice and has received blood pressure medication, but it is different from the type he usually takes, his brother said.

0,"The prison cell that has been Jason Rezaian’s home for most of the past 141 days has no mattress. He has slept on blankets on the hard floor and awakened each morning with back pain, for which he has received no treatment. He suffers from chronic eye infections that have persisted for so long his family fears permanent damage to his vision. For more than a month, he has been afflicted by a groin inflammation so painful he sometimes has trouble standing. Almost five months after Rezaian’s still-unexplained arrest, family members say conditions in Iran’s Evin prison are taking a fearsome toll on the 38-year-old Tehran correspondent for The Washington Post. But even worse than the physical discomforts, they say, are the psychological effects from near-total isolation and uncertainty over how long the ordeal will last. The uncertainty deepened further Sunday withIran’s announcement that formal charges — still unspecified — have been filed. “Every day, we’re in new territory,” Rezaian’s brother, Ali, a California businessman, said in an interview. “Never has a Western journalist been held this long. It’s taking a devastating toll on him, physically and mentally.” Worry over Rezaian’s health has prompted family members to speak in unprecedented detail about his well-being as he nears the end of his fifth month in detention. In interviews, relatives spoke of his growing despair in recent weeks as Iranian officials repeatedly dangled the possibility of freedom and then took it away again. Iranian officials have kept Rezaian in solitary confinement for most of his time in detention, never allowing him to meet his attorney and permitting only a handful of visits with his wife and one other relative, family members say. He was not allowed to contact his U.S.-based family until two weeks ago, when he was permitted to call his mother on Thanksgiving Day. “At first, I thought he sounded great, but as we talked, I could tell he wasn’t,” Mary Breme Rezaian said of the conversation. “We tried to talk about past things and previous Thanksgivings, but we both kept breaking down in tears.” Rezaian, a San Francisco native and son of an Iranian immigrant, was arrested at his Tehran home July 22 with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi. She was released on bail in October, but Iranian officials extended Rezaian’s detention for an additional two months, citing an ongoing investigation. In Iran, the filing of formal charges sometimes can lead to a release after a bail hearing, but it also throws new uncertainty into the case, including the possibility of more delays, according to human rights experts familiar with the country’s legal system. “In national security cases, the judge can renew temporary pretrial detention indefinitely,” said Faraz Sanei, an Iran researcher for Human Rights Watch. “And [the judge] can prevent lawyers speaking to clients or accessing files.” No public explanation has been provided for the arrests, and Iranian officials did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment for this article. Some experts have speculated that Rezaian has been caught up in a domestic power struggle between Iranian political factions feuding over Tehran’s recent diplomatic opening toward the West. Iran’s influential Human Rights Council secretary, Mohammed Javad Larijani, last week called the case a “fiasco” and expressed hope that the matter would be quickly resolved. The Obama administration, which is engaged in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, has stepped up pressure on Iran’s government in the past week. On Sunday, Secretary of State John F. Kerry urged Iran to drop the charges against Rezaian, saying the journalist “poses no threat to the Iranian government or to Iran’s national security.” A State Department spokesman said Tuesday that the United States remained “committed to returning Jason Rezaian to his family, friends and loved ones.” But with no end to the ordeal in sight, the Rezaian family’s frustration is growing. Relatives have begun to speak more candidly, drawing on details provided by visitors to paint a portrait of Rezaian’s life since his arrest. Their account, which matches descriptions by former inmates of Evin prison, depicts an endless cycle of physical deprivation, extreme isolation and frequent interrogations apparently aimed at coercing Rezaian to confess to wrongdoing. “It is constant pressure for him: psychological pressure, interrogation tactics,” Ali Rezaian said. “They’re trying to manipulate his psychological state, to get misinformation to make him more compliant with what they want him to do.” Since the day of his arrest, relatives say, Rezaian has been mostly kept in solitary confinement in Evin, a fortress-like prison on Tehran’s outskirts originally built by Iran’s last monarch, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Former prisoners who spent time in Evin’s solitary-confinement unit described cramped cells that are miserably hot in the summer and cold in winter. One former inmate, Iranian-born scholar and author Haleh Esfandiari, recalled a lack of amenities other than a sink, a pair of blankets and a Koran. Esfandiari spent 105 days in Evin and, like Rezaian, had no mattress. “The door is locked, and you’re on your own,” said Esfandiari, who now directs the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a Washington think tank. “To go to the bathroom, you have to knock on the door. The whole idea [is] to move you to despair, to make you feel isolated,” she said. “They keep repeating that no one in the outside world cares about you.” For Rezaian, the ordeal has been complicated by health problems. The journalist was being treated for high blood pressure at the time of his arrest, and family members worried that a combination of stress and a lack of access to medicine could aggravate his condition. Rezaian eventually was given an Iranian version of his blood-pressure medication, but inthe meantime, other problems emerged. His chronic eye infections went untreated for weeks, and the symptoms have continued since the prison recently began administering eye drops, family members said. More troubling is a testicular inflammation that surfaced about a month ago and causes bouts of excruciating pain, family members said. In recent days, Rezaian was given a sonogram to determine the cause of the inflammation, but the results of the tests are not yet known. “They’ve been undertreated,” Ali Rezaian said of his brother’s medical problems. “He has been able to see a doctor twice, but in both cases it took over a month of efforts and him complaining about conditions.” He described his brother as “very depressed, almost to the point of losing hope.” Rezaian’s surprise telephone call at Thanksgiving brought a measure of relief, ending a four-month drought in direct contact between the prisoner and his U.S. relatives. Mary Rezaian said she spoke with her son for half an hour, but she was acutely aware that others were present in the room with her son and listening to the conversation. “There were topics I could not begin to address,” she said. “Both of us were bemused to be speaking to one another. There was not advanced warning, so we couldn’t really prepare.” Although other journalists have been arrested in Iran, Rezaian did not expect that he would be targeted, his mother said. Rezaian had taken great care not to touch any of the tripwires that had gotten other journalists in trouble with Iran’s Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, the agency that grants credentials to foreign journalists. “He knew about the high-profile cases where people had broken the rules,” she said. “He followed the rules.” She said her son did not complain about his plight during his Thanksgiving phone call other than to express regret about upsetting the family’s holiday plans. Before his arrest, Rezaian had expected a visit home for the holidays with his wife, the first since their recent marriage. “I was really hoping to bring Yegi this year,” he told his mother, using his wife’s nickname. Mary Rezaian tried to be reassuring during the call, thinking at the time that her son probably would be released soon, she said. After all, he had not been charged with a crime, and the clock was running down on the 60-day extension that had kept him locked up since October. “The expectation was that we’d be seeing each other,” she said. The announcement of formal charges against Rezaian came nine days later.","The prison cell that has been Jason Rezaian’s home for most of the past 141 days has no mattress. He has slept on blankets on the hard floor and awakened each morning with back pain, for which he has received no treatment. He suffers from chronic eye infections that have persisted for so long his family fears permanent damage to his vision. For more than a month, he has been afflicted by a groin inflammation so painful he sometimes has trouble standing. Almost five months after Rezaian’s still-unexplained arrest, family members say conditions in Iran’s Evin prison are taking a fearsome toll on the 38-year-old Tehran correspondent for The Washington Post. But even worse than the physical discomforts, they say, are the psychological effects from near-total isolation and uncertainty over how long the ordeal will last. The uncertainty deepened further Sunday withIran’s announcement that formal charges — still unspecified — have been filed. “Every day, we’re in new territory,” Rezaian’s brother, Ali, a California businessman, said in an interview. “Never has a Western journalist been held this long. It’s taking a devastating toll on him, physically and mentally.” Worry over Rezaian’s health has prompted family members to speak in unprecedented detail about his well-being as he nears the end of his fifth month in detention. In interviews, relatives spoke of his growing despair in recent weeks as Iranian officials repeatedly dangled the possibility of freedom and then took it away again. Iranian officials have kept Rezaian in solitary confinement for most of his time in detention, never allowing him to meet his attorney and permitting only a handful of visits with his wife and one other relative, family members say. He was not allowed to contact his U.S.-based family until two weeks ago, when he was permitted to call his mother on Thanksgiving Day. “At first, I thought he sounded great, but as we talked, I could tell he wasn’t,” Mary Breme Rezaian said of the conversation. “We tried to talk about past things and previous Thanksgivings, but we both kept breaking down in tears.” Rezaian, a San Francisco native and son of an Iranian immigrant, was arrested at his Tehran home July 22 with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi. She was released on bail in October, but Iranian officials extended Rezaian’s detention for an additional two months, citing an ongoing investigation. In Iran, the filing of formal charges sometimes can lead to a release after a bail hearing, but it also throws new uncertainty into the case, including the possibility of more delays, according to human rights experts familiar with the country’s legal system. “In national security cases, the judge can renew temporary pretrial detention indefinitely,” said Faraz Sanei, an Iran researcher for Human Rights Watch. “And [the judge] can prevent lawyers speaking to clients or accessing files.” No public explanation has been provided for the arrests, and Iranian officials did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment for this article. Some experts have speculated that Rezaian has been caught up in a domestic power struggle between Iranian political factions feuding over Tehran’s recent diplomatic opening toward the West. Iran’s influential Human Rights Council secretary, Mohammed Javad Larijani, last week called the case a “fiasco” and expressed hope that the matter would be quickly resolved. The Obama administration, which is engaged in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, has stepped up pressure on Iran’s government in the past week. On Sunday, Secretary of State John F. Kerry urged Iran to drop the charges against Rezaian, saying the journalist “poses no threat to the Iranian government or to Iran’s national security.” A State Department spokesman said Tuesday that the United States remained “committed to returning Jason Rezaian to his family, friends and loved ones.” But with no end to the ordeal in sight, the Rezaian family’s frustration is growing.

The hacking occurred just before a meeting in Berlin between Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and German President Joachim Gauck. Yatsenyuk is set to meet Merkel on Thursday. Germany has been a firm supporter of Ukraine in its confrontation with Russia, which Kiev accuses of aiding armed separatists in eastern Ukraine. In a statement on its Web site, a group calling itself CyberBerkut asserted responsibility. “Berkut” is a reference to the riot squads used by the government of Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian Ukrainian president who was ousted in February. — Reuters MEXICO 10 bodies, 11 heads found in Guerrero Authorities in Mexico say 10 bodies and 11 severed heads have been discovered in clandestine graves in the troubled southern state of Guerrero. The remains were found Tuesday in Chilapa de Alvarez, and state prosecutor Miguel Ángel Godínez Muñoz said Wednesday that investigators were examining six sites. Most of the bodies — many with the hands tied — showed signs of torture. The 11 heads were unearthed in one of the graves. In November, 11 headless bodies were found in the area. Guerrero is the state where 43 students disappeared in September at the hands of police, sparking protests across the country. — Associated Press CUBA 3 political prisoners freed, activist says Three Cuban political prisoners were freed Wednesday, and a leading human rights advocate said he believed their liberation was part of a U.S.-Cuban deal to release 53 dissidents. The head of Cuba’s Human Rights and Reconciliation Commission, Elizardo Sánchez, said 19-year-old twins Diango Vargas Martín and Bianco Vargas Martín were released without any of the judicial procedures that normally precede the liberation of those held in politically related cases. He said Wednesday night that Enrique Figuerola Miranda had just been freed under similar circumstances. The releases followed days of mounting criticism in the United States of a rapprochement between Havana and Washington that included an agreement to release 53 prisoners that the Obama administration wanted freed. According to Amnesty International, the brothers were arrested in December 2012 as they tried to return to their home, where they lived with their mother, a member of the dissident group Ladies in White. They had been held on charges of using violence or intimidation against a state official. — Associated Press BRAZIL New rules target Caesarean births Brazil has unveiled new rules aimed at stemming the South American nation’s “epidemic” of Caesareans and promoting natural births among private health-care providers. Health Minister Arthur Chioro called Brazil’s reliance on C-sections, which account for more than eight out of 10 births handled by private providers, a “public health problem.” Under the requirements announced Tuesday, health insurance companies have to provide users with information about the percentage of Caesareans performed by individual doctors and hospitals. The ministry said Caesareans multiply by 120 percent the risk of respiratory illnesses among infants and triple the risk of maternal mortality during childbirth. — Associated Press Colombian rebel group opens door to talks:  Colombia’s second-largest rebel group said it is willing to lay down its arms if government-brokered peace talks open political space for leftist groups.

0,"Five weeks after being charged in a Tehran court, Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post journalist imprisoned in Iran, still does not know the exact nature of the allegations against him and remains unable to speak to a lawyer, the reporter’s family said after visiting him twice last month. In what appears to be the longest imprisonment for a Western journalist in Iran, Rezaian, who has been the newspaper’s Iran bureau chief since 2012, has been held at Tehran’s Evin prison for more than 170 days. Weeks after an initial court date, he is aware only that the five separate charges against him relate to alleged “activities outside the bounds of journalism,” said his mother, Mary Breme Rezaian, and his brother, Ali Rezaian. His family called on Iran’s government to permit Rezaian, a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen, access to a lawyer and to make the allegations against him public. “The fact of the matter is that they have since the beginning bent or broken their rules, and ignored the constitutional requirements that they have, in how they handle a detainee,” his brother said. “Jason is aware of that, and it’s very frustrating for him,” Ali Rezaian said. “That’s part of what’s causing him so much stress and difficulty.” The Washington Post has repeatedly called for the immediate release of Rezaian, who was accredited to work as a journalist in Iran. Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron underscored the paper’s concern about Rezaian’s detention in a year-end note to staff. “We feel outrage at the severe injustice endured by Jason Rezaian, our cherished correspondent, who has been imprisoned for many months in Iran on unspecified charges,” Baron wrote. The Obama administration has also appealed for Rezaian’s release, and Secretary of State John F. Kerry has raised his case with Iranian officials during international talks over Tehran’s nuclear program. Kerry is expected to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Geneva this week during the latest round of talks. Zarif has previously called Rezaian a “fair reporter” and said he “had hoped all along that his detention would be short.” Rezaian, who was born and raised in California, was arrested on July 22 along with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi. But he was not officially charged until a court session on Dec. 6. His family said that Rezaian, who speaks Farsi but does not read or write the language, was provided a court interpreter who ostensibly spoke English but was unable to adequately communicate the charges that were being presented. “He’s still not 100 percent sure” what the charges are, Ali Rezaian said. “There’s never been any specific accusation of wrongdoing.” Salehi, an Iranian national and fellow journalist, was released on bail in October but is unable to leave Iran. She now faces charges of her own, Rezaian’s family said, but those charges appear to be less severe than those levied against her husband. Mary Rezaian, who resides in Istanbul, traveled to Iran in December and was granted permission to visit her son twice at the end of last month. During the first visit, which took place on Dec. 25, she was accompanied by Salehi’s mother. The two women met with Rezaian for about an hour. While they talked, a camera set on a tripod filmed the meeting. Mary Rezaian said she was taken aback by her son’s appearance. “He looked very different,” she said. “He had lost 40 pounds.” In a second visit on Dec. 30, both his mother and Salehi were permitted to speak with Rezaian separately, but only for a short while. It was the first time that Salehi had been permitted to see or talk to her husband since early December. Mary Rezaian said her son has struggled to obtain adequate treatment for several health problems. Prison officials are providing medication for chronic high blood pressure, but Rezaian, 38, went weeks without treatment for an eye infection. He has also suffered from back problems resulting from sleeping on the floor and at times has been unable to walk normally. Rezaian also appears to be struggling to keep his spirits up, his mother said. “Jason is normally a very sunny, bubbly person,” she said. “I would say that he is depressed and very frustrated.” While Rezaian was previously held in solitary confinement, he is now kept in a cell with another prisoner, his family said. He is given access to fresh air and exercise on a regular basis. Initially, he was subjected to extensive interrogations five to six days a week, but he has not been interrogated for some time. Ali Rezaian said the lengthy interrogation reflected the weaknesses of the case against his brother. The government “has been trying to generate proof of something, of anything,” he said. Iranian officials have not allowed Rezaian to speak to a lawyer his family has hired in Tehran. Nor has the lawyer been able to obtain information about the charges against Rezaian. His case is now expected to be referred to Iranian court for trial, but it is unclear when that will occur.","Five weeks after being charged in a Tehran court, Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post journalist imprisoned in Iran, still does not know the exact nature of the allegations against him and remains unable to speak to a lawyer, the reporter’s family said after visiting him twice last month.

0,"Iranian judiciary authorities have referred the case of a detained Washington Post journalist to Tehran’s Revolutionary Court, a news agency reported Wednesday, in a move that appears to set the stage for a review before a possible trial. A statement by Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, cited by the semiofficial Iranian Students’ News Agency (ISNA), said the court file on Jason Rezaian has moved to the Revolutionary Court for “processing.” The phrase suggests that the charges against him, which have not been made public, could be studied by the court before it decides whether to set a trial date or keep the case in a holding pattern. The Revolutionary Court handles Iran’s most sensitive cases. Dolatabadi’s brief statement said, “After the issuance of indictment, the case against Jason Rezaian has been referred for processing to Tehran’s Revolutionary Court.” Rezaian, The Post’s bureau chief in Tehran, has been held in an Iranian prison for more than five months without access to a lawyer. He was officially charged Dec. 6, but he does not know the exact allegations against him, other than that they pertain to purported “activities outside the bounds of journalism,” his mother and brother said in a recent interview. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, said in a statement: “We still do not know what charges the Iranian authorities have brought against our correspondent Jason Rezaian, but we hope the referral of his case to a Revolutionary Court represents a step forward toward Jason’s prompt release. “This step gives Iran’s judiciary an opportunity to demonstrate its fairness and independence by determining that the charges­ are baseless. We call on Iran to make these charges public, to allow Jason access to a lawyer and to bring a swift and just resolution of a six-month-long nightmare that has been extremely difficult for Jason and his family.” Secretary of State John F. Kerry and other U.S. negotiators have repeatedly raised Rezaian’s case during talks on Iran’s nuclear program. Rezaian, 38, has dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship. Earlier Wednesday in Geneva, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in remarks before a series of meetings with Kerry that his government is willing to provide “humanitarian assistance” to Rezaian as courts work to resolve the case. “The government is doing its best to be of assistance,” Zarif said. But he said the case remained under the jurisdiction of Iran’s powerful judiciary, which is directly overseen by the ruling clerics. “This is a judicial matter, so we will have to wait for the judiciary to move forward. But we will try to provide all the humanitarian assistance that we could,” he said. “We hope that this issue will be resolved,” Zarif said. He also said he was pleased that Rezaian’s mother was able to visit him in prison twice at the end of December. Mary Breme Rezaian expressed alarm over her son’s weight loss and concern for his health, which has deteriorated during his lengthy confinement. She also met with her son’s “interrogator,” ISNA said, citing the prosecutor’s statement. Kerry raised the issue of Rezaian’s detention in his meetings with Zarif, according to senior State Department officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. One of them said the United States was aware of the reports that Rezaian’s case has been referred to a court. “We continue to monitor the situation closely and are seeking further information,” the official said. The State Department officials also said Kerry expressed concern for three other Americans in prison or otherwise unaccounted for in Iran. Among the three is Amir Hekmati, a Marine veteran who has been held by the country since August 2011. Hekmati, who has dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, was captured while visiting his grandmother in Iran, his family says. Tehran has accused him of being a CIA spy, a charge that Hekmati and the U.S. government deny.

Kerry raised the issue of Rezaian’s detention in his meetings with Zarif, according to senior State Department officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. One of them said the United States was aware of the reports that Rezaian’s case has been referred to a court. “We continue to monitor the situation closely and are seeking further information,” the official said. The State Department officials also said Kerry expressed concern for three other Americans in prison or otherwise unaccounted for in Iran. Among the three is Amir Hekmati, a Marine veteran who has been held by the country since August 2011. Hekmati, who has dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, was captured while visiting his grandmother in Iran, his family says. Tehran has accused him of being a CIA spy, a charge that Hekmati and the U.S. government deny. Morello reported from Geneva."
1,"Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Thursday that U.S. diplomats remain “very much focused” on efforts to release Americans held in Iran, including a Washington Post journalist whose case is now in the hands of a top court. The remarks by Kerry, during a stop in Bulgaria, came a day after Tehran’s chief prosecutor said Iran’s Revolutionary Court has the case of The Post’s Tehran bureau chief, Jason Rezaian, who has been detained since July. The charges against Rezaian have not been made public, and he has been denied access to a lawyer. It was unclear whether the court was planning to further review the case or move toward trial. Kerry said U.S. envoys constantly press for information on Rezaian and other U.S. citizens held in Iran while seeking their release. The disputes also could assume greater prominence as world powers and Iran continue talks on possible ways to monitor the country’s nuclear program. “We are very much focused on each of these citizens,” Kerry said in Bulgaria’s capital, Sofia. “We are currently engaged in efforts to follow up on them.” Rezaian’s brother, Ali Rezaian, repeated the family’s request that the journalist receive access to legal counsel and that the accusations against him be made public. “While we are disappointed that the Iranian judiciary did not dismiss these as-yet-unspecified charges, we are encouraged by the fact that, with the case now squarely in the hands of the judiciary, it is moving through their legal process in a more timely and transparent manner,” Ali Rezaian said. He added that it was the responsibility of Iran’s judiciary to “immediately grant Jason access to a lawyer and his case file, as he was assured when he was charged in December and has been required by Iranian law since July.” On Wednesday, Iranian news agencies quoted Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi as saying that Rezaian’s case had moved to the Revolutionary Court for “processing.” The wording suggested that the court could study the case before moving toward a possible trial. The Revolutionary Court handles Iran’s most sensitive cases, including those involving security matters. Rezaian, 38, was officially charged Dec. 6, but he does not know the exact allegations against him, other than that they pertain to purported “activities outside the bounds of journalism,” his family said in a recent interview. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, said in a statement Wednesday: “We still do not know what ­charges the Iranian authorities have brought against our correspondent Jason Rezaian, but we hope the referral of his case to a Revolutionary Court represents a step forward toward Jason’s prompt release. “This step gives Iran’s judiciary an opportunity to demonstrate its fairness and independence by determining that the charges­ are baseless. We call on Iran to make these charges public, to allow Jason access to a lawyer and to bring a swift and just resolution of a six-month-long nightmare that has been extremely difficult for Jason and his family.” Rezaian has dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship.

0,"A Washington Post journalist detained in Iran for more than six months will stand trial “soon,” Iran’s official news agency reported Wednesday, but the charges against him remain unknown. The report by the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency gave no additional information about Iran’s allegations against Jason Rezaian, The Post’s bureau chief in Tehran. Rezaian, a dual American-Iranian citizen, also has not had access to legal counsel since his detention in late July. “We have yet to hear any accounting of any charges against Jason, who after six months in custody has still not been provided access to a lawyer,” said a statement from Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor. “It is appalling and outrageous that Jason remains behind bars. A fair and just approach by Iran’s judiciary could only result in his immediate release.” The IRNA report quoted Gholam Hossein Esmaeili, a senior judicial official, as saying Rezaian “will be tried soon,” but no further timetable was mentioned. Nor have authorities elaborated on a vague statement that Rezaian has been charged with unspecified activities outside the bounds of journalism. Earlier this month, Rezaian’s case was referred to Iran’s Revolutionary Court, which handles most sensitive issues such as security-related proceedings. Esmaeili said Rezaian “is in touch with his family and allowed” to have additional meetings with relatives, IRNA reported. But there was no mention of appeals for Rezaian to have contact with attorneys. Rezaian’s brother, Ali Rezaian, said the family welcomes small steps toward transparency and improved treatment in his case. “During our mother’s brief visit with Jason in December, he told her that he was no longer being held in solitary confinement,” Ali Rezaian said. “We do not know when this change took place, but he continues to be held in Evin prison in Tehran.” Ali Rezaian added: “We welcome the additional transparency that appears to have developed since Jason’s case was referred to the court. We know that when any evidence is presented, it will prove what we already know — that Iran’s silence and disregard for their legal process these past six months is due to the weakness of their case, and Jason should be immediately set free.” Secretary of State John F. Kerry and other U.S. officials have used talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear program as a forum to also raise the subject of Rezaian and other Americans jailed in Iran. Kerry said last month that he was distressed that Rezaian has not been allowed to speak to a lawyer hired by his family, which Kerry called a “clear violation of Iran’s own laws and international norms.” Rezaian, his journalist wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and two photojournalists were detained July 22 in Tehran.

0,"The family of Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who has been detained in Iran for more than half a year, issued a statement Sunday that was sharply critical of the Iranian government, after what they called the “very disturbing” development that Rezaian and his wife will be tried by a judge known for imposing harsh sentences. Rezaian’s brother, Ali, and their mother, Mary Rezaian, questioned the rationale for assigning the case to Judge Abolghassem Salavati, the head of a Revolutionary Court branch where sensitive cases are tried. Salavati has imposed long prison sentences, lashings and in some cases death for defendants in a number of high-profile cases involving national security and political offenses. He has been sanctioned by the European Union since 2011. “We find it very disturbing that the judiciary would select a judge to oversee the case who has been sanctioned by (and barred from entering) the European Union due to what it calls ‘gross human rights violations,’ ” the family said. The 38-year-old reporter was arrested July 22 along with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who also is a reporter. Salehi was released on bail, but Rezaian has been detained ever since and has been unable to see a lawyer. The exact nature of the charges against him has never been made clear, other than a statement saying he was accused of activities beyond the scope of journalism. His family denied the accusations and pointedly contrasted his actions with those of the Iranian government. “Jason has dedicated the past decade of his life to informing the world of the true nature of Iran, the Iranian people, and their culture,” the statement said. “In stark contrast, the Iranian government has spent the past six months displaying to the world a disregard for its own laws and the international human rights agreements that it has pledged to follow. “What Iran expects to gain from the prolonged and unjust detention of Jason is unclear to us. What is evident to us, though, is that this ‘trial’ has nothing to do with Jason or Yeganeh’s actual actions, and may simply be a pretense to distract the world from some other motive the government may have.” News that their case had been assigned to Salavati, which was first reported by the New York Times, appears to reflect an ongoing power struggle between moderates surrounding President Hassan Rouhani and hard-liners allied with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, called for Rezaian’s release in a statement Sunday. “There has been no justice in the case of our colleague Jason Rezaian since the beginning,” Baron said. “He was held for months without knowing the accusations against him. Now that the case is proceeding to trial, the charges still have not been specified. He still hasn’t been allowed to see a lawyer. This case has unfolded, and continues to unfold, without a hint of fairness and justice. Jason should be released immediately. What has happened to him is an abomination and deserves the world’s condemnation.” The Rezaians echoed the sense of urgency, saying, “We remain hopeful that the proper authorities will ensure that the court will quickly convene and that the judge, despite his reputation, will even more quickly discover no basis for a finding other than ‘not guilty’ and will order Jason released immediately.” The jurist selected to preside over the case is known among human rights groups for his actions as head of the Revolutionary Court’s Branch 15, responsible for adjudicating cases involving national security. Salavati is among a handful of judges who have handed down stiff sentences for alleged offenses by journalists, lawyers, activists and minority groups. Salavati regularly issues the toughest sentences of all, including the death penalty for anti-government protesters. In a case that received international attention, Salavati imposed an eight-year prison sentence on two American hikers who were picked up near Iran’s border with Iraq in 2009 and accused of espionage. After spending more than two years in prison, the two were released on bail. Salavati has frequently locked up critics of the government. In 2012, he gave the daughter of moderate former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani six months in prison after she said in an interview with a foreign, Persian-language online publication that the country was being run by “thugs and hoodlums.” She was charged with engaging in “propaganda against the system.” For many Iranians, Salavati’s name is intimately connected with the trials of hundreds of protesters arrested after the disputed reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in June 2009. In nationally televised proceedings in his courtroom, dozens of defendants confessed to participating in protests inspired by Western intelligence agencies. Several of the protesters were sentenced to death, including one who had admitted to throwing a rock. “He’s known for issuing death sentences and very heavy prison sentences for basically political charges,” said Rod Sanjabi, executive director of the Connecticut-based Iran Human Rights Documentation Center. “Typically, the chances are there has been coercion and the extraction of a confession, and the likelihood of inadequate rights of counsel. That is how cases function in the Revolutionary courts. But even within that context, he has a reputation of being a hanging judge with no apparent legal knowledge.” Faraz Sanei, an Iran researcher for Human Rights Watch, said some former prisoners and lawyers who have appeared in court before Salavati say they were not allowed to present a defense. Others accuse the judge of being a rubber stamp for Iran’s intelligence services. Despite his reputation, Salavati remains a shadowy figure. His ­résumé is unknown, and it is unclear whether he attended law school. It also is not certain that Salavati is his real name. According to Sanei, many Revolutionary Court judges use pseudonyms. Revolutionary Court judges do not have the last word in the Iranian judicial system, though. Death-penalty cases automatically go to the Supreme Court for a final decision, while national security cases are sent to appellate courts that often reduce, but sometimes increase, prison terms. Rezaian holds dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, but the Iranian government considers him solely Iranian, denying any access to him by diplomats representing U.S. interests in Tehran. His family has reported that his health is failing and that his emotional strength is waning. Secretary of State John F. Kerry and other U.S. officials have used talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear program as a forum to raise the issue of the incarceration of Rezaian and other Americans jailed in Iran.

0,"Deb Firestone remembers the day her father called home. It was Feb. 4, around 5 in the afternoon. Her mother had gone out to an important meeting — the first lady was going to be there — leaving Firestone, 16, at home with her two younger brothers and the music teacher. They were sitting at the electric organ in their split-level suburban home when the phone rang. Being the oldest, Firestone answered. “Deb?” It was her father’s voice. Firestone doesn’t remember what she said. Because what do you say across 6,500 miles from your dining room in Rockville to someplace in Iran where your father is being held hostage? While the organ lesson continued, Deb and her dad exchanged small talk, almost as if he were checking in at the end of a day’s work. As if he were about to head home. He was there, and yet he wasn’t there. And that, says Firestone, is pretty much what it’s been like for the 35 years since that call. Firestone’s father, Bruce German, was the budget officer at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 when it was overrun by militant Iranian students. He was seized and held captive for 444 days with 51 other hostages. He came home in 1981, and then, maybe a year later, when the White House welcome ceremony was a mere memory and the well-wishers had put away their yellow ribbons, he moved out, leaving his wife, with whom he had exchanged so many loving letters, and their three children, about whom he had talked with his fellow hostages. That, at least, is how Firestone, 51, remembers it. Her mother, Marge German, is still irked that a meeting with Rosalynn Carter made her miss her husband’s call. And Bruce German chooses not to tell his story publicly — and declined a request to be interviewed. He lives in Pennsylvania, and Firestone says she rarely gets to speak with him. Not on his birthday or at Christmas. Not on the Nov. 4 anniversary of his capture, or on Jan. 20, the date the hostages were released. Firestone says he wasn’t at her wedding or at her brothers’ weddings; that he doesn’t know his six grandchildren; and that he last saw her daughter, now 13, when she was about 4. “He misses big things, he misses small things,” the sixth-grade math teacher reflects, her voice quavering. “I hold on to one little shred of hope . . . he’s letting time go by, and you can’t get that back.” The remaining hostages — 13 of the 52 have died — are keenly aware that they can’t recover lost time, so they are looking with increasing urgency for another kind of restitution. They have turned to Congress in a bid for compensation for their captivity — for solitary confinement and mock firing squads, for beatings with rubber hoses and being hung, like laundry, over open elevator shafts, or run, blindfolded, into trees. And for the toll all this took on their families. They’ve pinned their hopes on legislation sponsored by Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia (home state of three former hostages), which “almost made it,” the Republican senator says, into December’s mammoth spending bill. They’re watching negotiations underway between the United States and Iran, wondering whether there will finally be an end to the diplomatic standoff prompted by their horrifying ordeals — and how that might affect their cause. And, 35 years on, as some of the hostages live out their last years, they are aware that if anyone is to benefit from a long-awaited windfall, it will probably be the next generation — Firestone’s generation. Because their own time to get justice is running out. ‘Look at how many lives they ruined.’ The Tehran hostages have been repeatedly frustrated in their quest for compensation because of a clause in the agreement that secured their freedom. The 1981 Algiers Accords — the deal Algerian diplomats brokered between the United States and Iran that finally brought the 50 men and two women home — barred the hostages from taking legal action against Iran. When they’ve tried, the State Department has argued— against its own diplomats and the people who protected them— that the accords are still binding. A deal is a deal, after all. And this one succeeded in ending one of the most traumatic episodes of late-20th-century American history. The upshot? Not only has Iran never paid a penalty for overrunning the embassy, violating fundamental principles of diplomatic immunity that reach back to antiquity and are codified in a 1961 treaty, but a number of the former hostages say they feel let down by the country they signed up to serve. Don Cooke, just 25 when he and the other hostages were freed, clearly recalls former-Secretary of State Cyrus Vance saying immediately after their release that the U.S. government would find a way to compensate the hostages for the injustices they had suffered. “The frustration,” says John Limbert, a junior Foreign Service officer at the time who spent many months in solitary confinement, “is that our own government has opposed us and has implicitly worked in concert with the Islamic Republic. . . . It’s like some kind of a bad John le Carre novel.” Having failed to win compensation for the hostages through the courts, Thomas Lankford, the Alexandria-based lawyer who represents them, turned to Congress. “We tried to fashion a remedy — from fines and penalties for companies and individuals sanctioned for doing business with Iran illegally,” he says. “Plus a surcharge.” And they were, he believes, on the “lip of success” at the end of last year when it seemed Isakson’s legislation might be included in the $1.1 trillion spending bill. Lankford slipped out of his seat at an Aaron Neville concert late one December night to finesse some key language, only to learn the next morning that it hadn’t made it into the bill. On the Jan. 20 anniversary of the hostages’ release, Isakson issued a statement saying he planned to reintroduce legislation soon. He continues to back the hostages’ quest out of a sense of “equity,” he says. Now, some of the former hostages wonder whether their cause might come up in the ongoing talks over curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions, whether compensating them could be part of an ultimate diplomatic deal. The United States is providing some sanctions relief to Iran as part of those negotiations, freeing up about about $490 million in Iranian revenue held abroad every three weeks. In an e-mail, a State Department official expressed sympathy with the hostages’ plight but says the “talks are focused on one issue and one issue only — ensuring that Iran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon” and that “we will continue to work with Congress to explore options” to compensate the former hostages. That may be the way of Washington. But it leaves further frustration and existential questions in its wake. “There needs to be some kind of impact” on the states that sponsor terrorism, Firestone says. “Look at how many lives they ruined.” Those ruined lives — documented in memoirs, reimagined in movies and relived in unrelenting nightmares — are now the baseline for the chillingly formulaic calculus of attaching price tags to historic wrongs, like the settlements with the Japanese interned during World War II, the 9/11 victims’ compensation fund, or the ongoing debate about reparations for slavery. So what’s the going rate for depression, divorce, substance abuse and premature deaths linked to 444 days of unmitigated stress? For long days whiled away in mental institutions? Should somebody like Cooke, who says the experience in Tehran left him with “a greater appreciation for living my life . . . that life is something to be treasured,” get the same amount as another former hostage who is eager to hide his name because he’s still convinced the Iranians will come over and kill him? What would it take to make whole the family of the late Leland “Jumper” Holland, the Army attache who worked in intelligence and thus was singled out to suffer, according to his son John Holland, who used to help his mother manage her husband’s bouts of crouching, mumbling fear? They all suffered, says Lankford, who emphasizes that he is simply asking that these hostages and their families be treated like other victims of terrorism. “When you live in fear of your every breath being your last, it changes everyone.” The figure Lankford names is $448 million. That, he explains, is in keeping with a historic standard applied by U.S. courts of $10,000 per hostage per day of captivity or about $4.4 million per head, and half that amount for each spouse and child. Although it is far more than the $50 per day that each hostage received from the government in the 1980s, it is a paltry request compared with the sums (including punitive damages) that U.S. courts have awarded in some cases. Associated Press journalist Terry Anderson won $341 million after being imprisoned for nearly seven years in Lebanon. American University of Beirut administrator Thomas Sutherland was awarded more than $350 million after being held almost as long. Both collected tens of millions from Iranian money held by the Pentagon, according to Washington lawyer Stuart Newberger of Crowell & Moring, who represented them. Other victims of terrorism who have won judgments but not yet received a payment see some benefit in the legal process itself. “It was important if an injustice had occurred that we use justice and the rule of law to the best effect that we could,” says Susan van de Ven, whose father, Middle East scholar Malcolm Kerr, was shot in the back of the head by Hezbollah gunmen in 1984 when he was president of the American University of Beirut. Van de Ven, whose book, “One Family’s Response to Terrorism,” explores the moral complexities of seeking compensation, recalls the six years of methodical deliberations that she went through with her mother and close relatives (including her brother, former NBA star and Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr) before deciding to bring suit almost 20 years after her father’s death. “We felt very conflicted about using the U.S. legal system when we felt the U.S. government had had a role to play in the problem my father found himself in,” recalls van de Ven, whose family has had deep ties in the Middle East for generations. Suing for damages, she says, “is an imperfect system, but far better than retribution.” The Tehran hostages argue, similarly, that their cause is not only about the money. The “principle of accountability” is compelling, says Limbert, who went on to become deputy assistant secretary of state for Iran and whose wife is Iranian. “The idea that the Iranian authorities endorsed the action and benefited from it and were never held accountable.” Compensation won’t change what’s happened, says Firestone, “but it would at least show us that the U.S. cares.” Notes from a crisis The television is on in the split-level Rockville home where Firestone picked up the call from her father 35 years ago and where Marge German still lives. The screen shows footage of the terrorist attack at Charlie Hebdo, of ordinary Parisians demonstrating solidarity with the dead journalists. Scenes like that sometimes bring the pain back, mother and daughter point out as they sit at the dining-room table. At times, they say, “It’s still very, very raw.” They are talking not only about the 444 days of the crisis, when Marge German sent packages of pineapple-raisin cookies along with her letters to Tehran and arranged for the hostages to get subscriptions to the Sporting News. They are thinking about the years since then, about how the stay-at-home mom who’d given up her career as a budget analyst found herself cobbling together Pell grants and student loans to put Firestone and her brothers through school. There’s no knowing how their lives might have played out if the hostage crisis hadn’t happened. What role, if any, the prolonged captivity and mock executions played in what came next. Whether everything might have been different had there been more support for the hostages and their families once they were reunited. People simply didn’t talk about post-traumatic stress order back then, says Firestone. German is writing a memoir about the crisis. She started 35 years ago, never imagining the arc the narrative would take. She flicks through the neatly typed pages, reading from the notes she took the day she missed her husband’s call and remembering how she questioned Deb after meeting Mrs. Carter, eager for new details about her absent spouse. Several other families got calls that afternoon, German says. She has a theory that the Iranians knew about the meeting with the first lady, so that when the hostages were finally allowed to telephone home, they would find their wives were out. That’s just the kind of thing the hostage takers would do, she says. To break their victims’ spirits and wreak havoc in their families’ lives.","Deb Firestone remembers the day her father called home. It was Feb. 4, around 5 in the afternoon. Her mother had gone out to an important meeting — the first lady was going to be there — leaving Firestone, 16, at home with her two younger brothers and the music teacher. They were sitting at the electric organ in their split-level suburban home when the phone rang. Being the oldest, Firestone answered. “Deb?” It was her father’s voice. Firestone doesn’t remember what she said. Because what do you say across 6,500 miles from your dining room in Rockville to someplace in Iran where your father is being held hostage? While the organ lesson continued, Deb and her dad exchanged small talk, almost as if he were checking in at the end of a day’s work. As if he were about to head home. He was there, and yet he wasn’t there. And that, says Firestone, is pretty much what it’s been like for the 35 years since that call. Firestone’s father, Bruce German, was the budget officer at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 when it was overrun by militant Iranian students. He was seized and held captive for 444 days with 51 other hostages. He came home in 1981, and then, maybe a year later, when the White House welcome ceremony was a mere memory and the well-wishers had put away their yellow ribbons, he moved out, leaving his wife, with whom he had exchanged so many loving letters, and their three children, about whom he had talked with his fellow hostages. That, at least, is how Firestone, 51, remembers it. Her mother, Marge German, is still irked that a meeting with Rosalynn Carter made her miss her husband’s call. And Bruce German chooses not to tell his story publicly — and declined a request to be interviewed. He lives in Pennsylvania, and Firestone says she rarely gets to speak with him. Not on his birthday or at Christmas. Not on the Nov. 4 anniversary of his capture, or on Jan. 20, the date the hostages were released. Firestone says he wasn’t at her wedding or at her brothers’ weddings; that he doesn’t know his six grandchildren; and that he last saw her daughter, now 13, when she was about 4. “He misses big things, he misses small things,” the sixth-grade math teacher reflects, her voice quavering. “I hold on to one little shred of hope . . . he’s letting time go by, and you can’t get that back.” The remaining hostages — 13 of the 52 have died — are keenly aware that they can’t recover lost time, so they are looking with increasing urgency for another kind of restitution. They have turned to Congress in a bid for compensation for their captivity — for solitary confinement and mock firing squads, for beatings with rubber hoses and being hung, like laundry, over open elevator shafts, or run, blindfolded, into trees. And for the toll all this took on their families. They’ve pinned their hopes on legislation sponsored by Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia (home state of three former hostages), which “almost made it,” the Republican senator says, into December’s mammoth spending bill. They’re watching negotiations underway between the United States and Iran, wondering whether there will finally be an end to the diplomatic standoff prompted by their horrifying ordeals — and how that might affect their cause. And, 35 years on, as some of the hostages live out their last years, they are aware that if anyone is to benefit from a long-awaited windfall, it will probably be the next generation — Firestone’s generation. Because their own time to get justice is running out. ‘Look at how many lives they ruined.’ The Tehran hostages have been repeatedly frustrated in their quest for compensation because of a clause in the agreement that secured their freedom. The 1981 Algiers Accords — the deal Algerian diplomats brokered between the United States and Iran that finally brought the 50 men and two women home — barred the hostages from taking legal action against Iran. When they’ve tried, the State Department has argued— against its own diplomats and the people who protected them— that the accords are still binding. A deal is a deal, after all. And this one succeeded in ending one of the most traumatic episodes of late-20th-century American history. The upshot? Not only has Iran never paid a penalty for overrunning the embassy, violating fundamental principles of diplomatic immunity that reach back to antiquity and are codified in a 1961 treaty, but a number of the former hostages say they feel let down by the country they signed up to serve. Don Cooke, just 25 when he and the other hostages were freed, clearly recalls former-Secretary of State Cyrus Vance saying immediately after their release that the U.S. government would find a way to compensate the hostages for the injustices they had suffered. “The frustration,” says John Limbert, a junior Foreign Service officer at the time who spent many months in solitary confinement, “is that our own government has opposed us and has implicitly worked in concert with the Islamic Republic. . . . It’s like some kind of a bad John le Carre novel.” Having failed to win compensation for the hostages through the courts, Thomas Lankford, the Alexandria-based lawyer who represents them, turned to Congress. “We tried to fashion a remedy — from fines and penalties for companies and individuals sanctioned for doing business with Iran illegally,” he says. “Plus a surcharge.” And they were, he believes, on the “lip of success” at the end of last year when it seemed Isakson’s legislation might be included in the $1.1 trillion spending bill. Lankford slipped out of his seat at an Aaron Neville concert late one December night to finesse some key language, only to learn the next morning that it hadn’t made it into the bill. On the Jan. 20 anniversary of the hostages’ release, Isakson issued a statement saying he planned to reintroduce legislation soon. He continues to back the hostages’ quest out of a sense of “equity,” he says. Now, some of the former hostages wonder whether their cause might come up in the ongoing talks over curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions, whether compensating them could be part of an ultimate diplomatic deal. The United States is providing some sanctions relief to Iran as part of those negotiations, freeing up about about $490 million in Iranian revenue held abroad every three weeks. In an e-mail, a State Department official expressed sympathy with the hostages’ plight but says the “talks are focused on one issue and one issue only — ensuring that Iran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon” and that “we will continue to work with Congress to explore options” to compensate the former hostages. That may be the way of Washington. But it leaves further frustration and existential questions in its wake. “There needs to be some kind of impact” on the states that sponsor terrorism, Firestone says. “Look at how many lives they ruined.” Those ruined lives — documented in memoirs, reimagined in movies and relived in unrelenting nightmares — are now the baseline for the chillingly formulaic calculus of attaching price tags to historic wrongs, like the settlements with the Japanese interned during World War II, the 9/11 victims’ compensation fund, or the ongoing debate about reparations for slavery. So what’s the going rate for depression, divorce, substance abuse and premature deaths linked to 444 days of unmitigated stress? For long days whiled away in mental institutions? Should somebody like Cooke, who says the experience in Tehran left him with “a greater appreciation for living my life . . . that life is something to be treasured,” get the same amount as another former hostage who is eager to hide his name because he’s still convinced the Iranians will come over and kill him? What would it take to make whole the family of the late Leland “Jumper” Holland, the Army attache who worked in intelligence and thus was singled out to suffer, according to his son John Holland, who used to help his mother manage her husband’s bouts of crouching, mumbling fear? They all suffered, says Lankford, who emphasizes that he is simply asking that these hostages and their families be treated like other victims of terrorism. “When you live in fear of your every breath being your last, it changes everyone.” The figure Lankford names is $448 million. That, he explains, is in keeping with a historic standard applied by U.S. courts of $10,000 per hostage per day of captivity or about $4.4 million per head, and half that amount for each spouse and child. Although it is far more than the $50 per day that each hostage received from the government in the 1980s, it is a paltry request compared with the sums (including punitive damages) that U.S. courts have awarded in some cases. Associated Press journalist Terry Anderson won $341 million after being imprisoned for nearly seven years in Lebanon. American University of Beirut administrator Thomas Sutherland was awarded more than $350 million after being held almost as long. Both collected tens of millions from Iranian money held by the Pentagon, according to Washington lawyer Stuart Newberger of Crowell & Moring, who represented them. Other victims of terrorism who have won judgments but not yet received a payment see some benefit in the legal process itself. “It was important if an injustice had occurred that we use justice and the rule of law to the best effect that we could,” says Susan van de Ven, whose father, Middle East scholar Malcolm Kerr, was shot in the back of the head by Hezbollah gunmen in 1984 when he was president of the American University of Beirut.

0,"MUNICH — Iran’s foreign minister said Sunday that he hopes Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post correspondent who has been in jail since July, will be cleared in court. Mohammad Javad Zarif, who was taking part in a security conference panel here, suggested that he is anticipating some clarity in Rezaian’s case. The 38-year-old reporter faces charges that still have not been made clear, along with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who has been released from pretrial detention. “I’ve tried my best to help him in a humanitarian way, providing for his mother’s visit. I hope he will be cleared in a court of law. That would be a good day for me,” Zarif said, in response to a question posed by the moderator, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. “I hope once the court process is completed, we will have a clear-cut case or we will have his acquittal.” Rezaian’s case was recently assigned to Judge Abolghassem Salavati, who has a record of imposing long sentences, lashings and, in some cases, death for defendants — including journalists, lawyers and activists — in cases of national security.","MUNICH — Iran’s foreign minister said Sunday that he hopes Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post correspondent who has been in jail since July, will be cleared in court.

0,"Here is a full transcript of the session at the Munich Security Conference on Sunday in which David Ignatius of The Washington Post interviewed Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister: David Ignatius: It’s my pleasure to moderate this discussion today with Mohammad Javad Zarif, who is Iran’s foreign minister, chief negotiator in the nuclear talks with the group variously known as the EU3+3 or the P5+1. But, by whatever name, one of the most important diplomatic negotiations of my lifetime. So, let’s get down to business. Dr. Zarif, it’s been written in the newspapers that you met yesterday with Secretary [John F.] Kerry here. There’s talk that you may actually be meeting again today for another meeting. And so I want to ask you in the way that Americans like to say, how’s it going? Mohammad Javad Zarif: First of all, let me say hello to everybody and it’s a great pleasure to be here. And, David, it’s good to have — to share this podium with you today. Actually we already met. We’re both early birds, so we met from 7 to 9 this morning. It indicates how much importance we attach to this process. We already met once as I arrived on Friday. And we met once today, and in the course of yesterday I had meetings with other members of E3+3 — Germany, U.K. and Russia. And I’ll meet [French Foreign Minister] Laurent Fabius after this meeting. We are engaged in a very serious discussion. The objective as [EU foreign affairs chief] Federica Mogherini just pointed out is rather clear. We set it out in the plan of action that we adopted — historic in my view — in Geneva in November of 2013 and that is the two objectives, which, in my view, is a singular objective, to make sure that Iran’s nuclear program remains exclusively peaceful. That means that Iran should, in fact, be able to exercise its right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, because without it exercising that right, it’s impossible to make sure that it’s peaceful. And secondly, to make sure that it’s peaceful. And by that it means that all the restrictions that have been imposed on Iran through sanctions, which we consider unacceptable, to be lifted. And it is important to recognize the fact that we need to move in this direction simultaneously. That is, as Iran takes steps to reassure the international community that it’s program remains peaceful — and the reason I use the word “reassure” is that over the last 10 years or more, Iran has been the subject of more IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections than probably any other country on the face of the Earth, and the IAEA has yet to find a single evidence that Iran’s program is anything but peaceful. So, we are prepared to reassure the international community — it seems that quite a bit of reassurance is needed for some of our negotiating partners, at least. But, at the same time, it is important that restrictions that have been imposed on the Iranian people be lifted. These restrictions did not achieve their intended result. You know that once, when the sanctions were imposed on Iran, Iran had less than 200 centrifuges. If the objective of the sanctions was to prevent Iran from developing its nuclear technology, they utterly failed because now we have 20,000 centrifuges. So we need to find another way, and I believe the E3+3 have come to realize that the only way to resolve this issue is through negotiations. And we have made quite a bit of success, and we make progress over the past many months. DI: So, so let me ask you. Knowing now that you got up early and had breakfast with Secretary Kerry for yet another round of discussions. Come back to that. How it’s going, and let me rephrase that. What would you say, as of this morning, after the latest, meeting are the principal remaining obstacles to completing the comprehensive agreement that was outlined in the JPOA [joint plan of action]? MJZ: Well, I guess Secretary Kerry will get his chance in the next panel to state his views. I believe that the most important obstacle to reaching an agreement is the need for realization that the only way to reach an agreement is through negotiations and through disagreement. This is, again as Mrs. Mogherini rightly pointed out, this is the opportunity to do it, and we need to seize this opportunity. It may not be repeated. And it is important for everybody to realize that the only way to deal with Iran is through respect and negotiations and meeting on a non-zero-sum game. If you look at the developments in the international scene over the past many years, we haven’t been able to resolve many problems and many crises because we have approached them from a zero-sum perspective. My gain has always been defined as somebody else’s loss, and through that, we never resolve problems. And I believe here we need to be able to define — and I believe I said this in this room last year — that unless we define mutual goals, shared objectives, common objectives, we won’t be able to resolve this. And that is how we approach this. We believe that it is in our interest to show the world that our nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. We define that as our objective, not the objective of the other side. We define it as our own objective, and that is why it doesn’t take a lot of sacrifice for us to show to the world that our nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. I believe the other side also needs to realize that imposing sanctions on the Iranian people has not only hurt the Iranian people, but has hurt the European economy, has hurt the American economy, has hurt the global economy — has not benefitted anybody — and it has not helped in the process either. So, we either lose together or win together, and unless we realize this, some people unfortunately believe that sanctions that have been imposed on Iran are an asset for them. I want to disabuse them of this. Sanctions are a liability. You need to get rid of them if you want a solution. And unless, particularly some politicians, unless they come to the realization that sanctions are a liability and they need to be lifted, we will not have a solution. So that’s the single most important issue, but I think we have made good headway in resolving even that. DI: I want to come back to the details of the agreement. And I’m going to, in particular, mark a mental note around the question of phase reduction of sanctions as a way to remove sanctions, but I want to step back a little bit. You’ve been seeing a lot of Secretary Kerry, and there was a picture that was taken of the two of you in Geneva when you were out for a stroll last January on the sidewalk, and a group of 21 Iranian parliamentarians are reported to have signed a petition. And I’m going to quote with your forgiveness from what was published in the Iranian newspapers. And the petition said your exhibitionist walk together with Kerry along Geneva sidewalks was certainly outside the norms of diplomacy [and asked] so why don’t you put a stop to such behavior? It seems that you have critics back home, judging from that petition. And so I want to ask you: What are your critics upset about? MJZ: Well, I think we need to realize the reality that Iran is not a monolithic society. And we like it. We have a variety of views, and they get a chance to express themselves. So that’s not bad. Secondly, there is a huge deal of mistrust in Iran vis-a-vis the West in general and the United States in particular. So every action that we take, every step, is under very serious scrutiny by our public because of that mistrust. So if you’re talking about lack of confidence or confidence deficit, there’s a lot to go around. It’s just not the West not having confidence in the Iranian program, and I don’t know why, but there’s a lot of reason — and I believe my colleagues in the West would understand that — from supporting Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war to overthrowing a democratically elected government in Iran and to whatever happened in between and afterwards that makes Iranians be at least skeptical of U.S. intentions. So anything I do is rightly scrutinized by our people, our parliamentarians, and I believe that’s the nature of the game and I’m ready for it. So I’ll go to the parliament, and I’ll explain what I was doing, and I will try to convince them that what I did was not outside the norms of diplomacy. That it had been done before, and it will be done — I mean people will do it in the future. But I give them every reason to be skeptical of everything I do. Because I’m actually taking very serious steps. Iran did not talk to the United States for 35 years. And now we are talking. And I believe these talks are useful. But they haven’t produced the intended results. We have not seen an end to the hostility that has been exhibited in the United States against Iran. And I believe it is important that we see some of that. But, unless we make progress, I give my critics in Iran every right to criticize me. And even if we make progress and if we reach an agreement, I believe there will be people in Iran who will remain skeptical of this. I believe they have every right to be skeptical. But they were skeptical about the joint plan of action that we adopted in Geneva. And IAEA report after another has indicated that Iran has lived up to all — and I underline “all” — its commitments under the JPOA. We have not violated or even misbehaved in one single incident. There is a difference of opinion in Iran, but what the government promises, it will deliver. DI: Will President [Hassan] Rouhani, as a leader of Iran who’s taken so many risks to sponsor these negotiations, will he be hurt if they fail? MJZ: Well, I want to correct a very wrong report by Reuters, unfortunately, that made [it seem] that those who talked to me in the past three days know that that was not a subject of our negotiations or discussions. DI: I should say there was a report that said that Dr. Zarif said this directly to Secretary Kerry yesterday. MJZ: And others. And the report predicted — this is news reporting — predicted that I’ll be doing it in the future. So, news organizations predicting the future is something new. But I didn’t — DI: — not so new. MJZ: Not so new. I mean predicting news is new. Analyzing is maybe not. But what is important is we have a very dynamic political system in Iran. I believe the entire Iranian population understands that this government — that Dr. Rouhani, his administration and the government in its entirety — particularly the leader of the revolution which today again supported our efforts in the negotiations, if only a few minutes ago. Everybody has taken every necessary measure to ensure that we succeed. All Iranians know this. If we fail — and I hope we won’t — they will not keep us or consider us responsible for that failure. They will consider attempts by asking too much from Iran as the reason for failure. But I’m not going to contemplate that. I’m not going to engage in a blame game; I don’t think a blame game is necessary. I think we will be talking about our success rather than our failure, and we will be looking for people to commend for success rather than people to blame for failure. DI: And what do you say, Dr. Zarif, to hard-liners. When I came to Tehran in December 2013 to see you, I visited Hossein Shariatmadari who is the editor of Kayhan [a newspaper in Iran], and he said to me essentially any concession to the West, any compromise, is an attempt to undermine our revolution, and I oppose it. And I want to ask you, what do you say as somebody who’s been deeply involved in the negotiations to people like that back home? How do you answer that criticism that says any compromise undermines us? MJZ: Well, I give them every reason as I said to be skeptical. I sympathize with them, I believe that — I’m skeptical. There is reason to be skeptical. But I believe that agreement and agreement in which there are no losers and no winners and an agreement in which the objectives of everybody is achieved is in the interest of everybody. In the interest of our region, in the interest of international peace and security and in the interest of Iranian scientific advancement. So, I don’t share that view, but I can understand and sympathize with his view about being forced into walking into these negotiations with a degree of skepticism and mistrust. And I believe the other side does the same. I mean, in Washington, people around you, in buildings close to you, are rather skeptical about our intentions, and they criticize Secretary Kerry and President Obama for what they’re doing. So we do not have a monopoly of skeptics. I mean the United States has them, too. DI: So I want to look with you, if I might, at some of the details that are before you with your next deadline coming, March 24. Quoting from the JPOA, which is the document that you already agreed to back in November 2013; it talked about a mutually defined enrichment program with practical limits and transparency measures. And it said that this comprehensive agreement would produce a reciprocal step-by-step process that would lead to the eventual removal of sanctions. So I want to unpack those ideas and start at the end with this idea of a step-by-step process of removing sanctions. Is that something — MJZ: — The step-by-step process does not refer to the removal of sanctions. You’re not reading the JPOA correctly. It says that it is a reciprocal step-by-step process, but the objective is the removal of sanctions, if you read the JPOA correctly. So, I’m not going to negotiate here certainly, but I believe sanctions have miserably failed at reaching their own objective. And removal of sanctions is a condition for an agreement, and I believe that condition can be met and will be met if we have an agreement. DI: But on this idea that it would be phased, is that something that Iran is prepared to discuss? MJZ: Again, I’m not negotiating here, but we will stick to the terms of the JPOA, and I do not believe that JPOA called for phased removal of sanctions. And if I had the text in front of me, I would read it to you, but I don’t, unfortunately. DI: I wrote down the text, and I could laboriously — but I will defer to the negotiator. So let me, since you don’t want to negotiate the details, let me jump to the basics — MJZ: No, I don’t want to negotiate the details here. I negotiate the details in the negotiating room. DI: I don’t know why you wouldn’t want to do this in this private setting. MJZ: You make the decision, final decision, I’ll negotiate with you right here. DI: So, let me cut to the thing that we all must think about and are concerned about, which is what if there isn’t an agreement by March 24 or June 30, the final deadline. And I’d be interested in your discussion of that and what we have in all of our minds, I think, is that, well if there isn’t an agreement, should we seek a little more time? Have we had enough progress that we can think maybe with a little more time we can get to where we want? MJZ: Well, first of all, I don’t think if we don’t have an agreement, it’ll be the end of the world. I mean, we tried, we failed, fine. We will think of other procedures. I hope it won’t be the same of each side trying to hurt the other without benefiting anything in the process. That’s basically what was done. So, it won’t be the end of the world, but I do not believe another extension is in the interest of anybody. As I did not believe this extension was even necessary or useful. But we did. And we’re reaching to the point that it is quite possible to make an agreement. I believe the same agreement could have been made three months ago, four months ago, six months ago. And I do not believe anything will be different a year down the road. So in my view, extension is not useful, not conducive to an agreement and all my energy and focus and that of my colleagues, and I’m sure my negotiating partners on the side of E3+3 are all focused on reaching an agreement at the earliest possible time. DI: That happy statement from Ambassador [Wolfgang] Ischinger was that we might have a little more time. So, if I hear you saying that you don’t think a formal extension is appropriate, if we’re not there, what about an informal stand-in-place situation. Often, you have that where you don’t have a formal agreement, but it’s in neither side’s interest to blow up the situation that exists. Would you think that would be a possibility, a likelihood? MJZ: David, I want to use the next six weeks concentrating on a solution, not concentrating on failure. And I believe it would be best if everybody concentrated on a solution. DI: So let me assume now that you’re going to get there. You’re going to get to a solution. And I want to ask you about what might follow an agreement. And, specifically, in a world that is being — in a Middle East that is being torn apart by regional conflict — a nightmare taking place around you, is there some way based on this process of negotiation, the broad conversations, that you might then move to regional issues? For example, some kind of security conference for the region would include Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United States, Russia — some way of talking about and beginning to resolve these terrible problems. MJZ: Well, I believe the problems in our region are both regional and global and require both regional and global approaches. And these approaches need to be multifaceted and multi-dimensional and cannot be only military or political. They have to be cultural; they have to involve various actors. I believe no player in our immediate neighborhood should be excluded. We have never attempted to exclude our friends in Saudi Arabia or others from a regional solution. Unfortunately, we have been the subject of exclusion. People have tried to exclude us to the detriment of the process. But Iran believes — and is ready, and I’m prepared — to engage with Saudi Arabia and to engage with Turkey, to engage with Egypt, to engage — we are already engaged with a lot of them, with Iraq, with Syria, with Turkey, with other friends in the region — but even those that are not currently engaged with Iran and have some preoccupation about excluding Iran from any process, we are prepared to engage them with or without the success of these negotiations to reach understanding. Because these problems are pressing. These problems are pressing in our region; these problems are pressing in the world. These problems will be detrimental to the peace and security of our region, of our people and of the world. So, I don’t think we need any conditionality to engage in resolving these problems, which will be first and foremost a threat to our own livelihoods. DI: And what would you say, Dr. Zarif, to an Arab leader who, if he was being candid, would say to you, Iran or Iran’s proxies today control Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut, Sanna [Yemen]. We feel encircled. How do you speak to that anxiety, which obviously is driving this moment. MJZ: That would be over-aggrandizing Iran’s power and underestimating the will of the people. And that would be an insult to the people of all these countries. I believe our region, the problems in our region will not be resolved by trying to simplify the problems. Iran is an important player in the region, has always been an important player in the region, will remain an important player in the region and in the wider world. But we do not believe that if Iran is an important player, other players in the region are unimportant or should be excluded. We have never set conditions for participation in Geneva II [Conference on Syria], for instance. We were invited to Geneva II, but then some people set conditions and said if Iran participates, we will not come. We never said if Saudi Arabia participates, we will not come. But unfortunately some of our friends did. So this is the problem. I think, if you’re asking me this question, you’re looking at the wrong address. We are ready. We are prepared to engage with our friends, with our neighbors in the region, and to move for the resolution of all these problems. Of course, we cannot resolve it by ourselves; they cannot resolve it by themselves. Even if we put all our efforts together, it’s a huge problem to resolve. We require a lot of work, a lot of input, a lot of participation by the people in the region, but we believe we should start at the right place. And the right place is not by attempting to exclude each other from this process. DI: I just would note that that endorsement of a regional framework for security discussions that would include Iran and Saudi Arabia is significant. And if that could be carried through is the beginning of a different and better way of dealing with problems. Let me ask you one more issue. As you know, as the world knows, Israel is terribly anxious because of statements that have been made by Iranian leaders that Iran threatens the security of Israel. Yesterday, Yitzhak Herzog, who’s running for prime minister in Israel, said if Iran is prepared — effectively — if Iran is prepared to live in peace with us, we’re prepared to accept Iran in the same way. What would you say to Israelis who feel that an Iranian nuclear program poses an existential threat to them? MJZ: Well, we do not have a weapons program; we will never have a weapons program. We never had a weapons program. They cannot create a smokescreen to hide their atrocities against the Palestinian people, they’re continued violations of Palestinian human rights, they’re continued acts of aggression against Palestinian and Lebanese and Jordanian and Syrian people under the guise of a hypothetical Iranian threat, which is more hype than anything else. Iran is not threatening anybody. We’re not threatening to use force. We’re not saying all options are on the table. I hope that those who continue to make these threats would read the United Nations charter, which says threats and use of force are against international law. DI: So, I’m going to close this, I’m going to take a brief point of personal and journalistic privilege. My colleague and personal friend Jason Rezaian, who’s our correspondent in Iran, has been imprisoned since last July with his wife. The charges have never been made clear, and it would be wrong of me not to use this public forum to say to the Iranian foreign minister that we dearly hope — and I speak for all journalists I think around the world — for his prompt release. Let me, having said that, thank you for being with us, thank you for being on stage and thank you for answering these questions. MJZ: Sure, you have the last word, but I believe Jason Rezaian has been charged. I’ve tried my best to help him in a humanitarian way, providing for his mother’s visit. I hope that he will be cleared of the charges in a court of law, and that will be a good day for me. His wife is now out of prison — has been for five, six months. And I hope that once the court process is completed, we will either have a clear-cut case or we will have his acquittal. DI: Good. MJZ: Thank you. DI: Thank you.","Here is a full transcript of the session at the Munich Security Conference on Sunday in which David Ignatius of The Washington Post interviewed Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister: David Ignatius: It’s my pleasure to moderate this discussion today with Mohammad Javad Zarif, who is Iran’s foreign minister, chief negotiator in the nuclear talks with the group variously known as the EU3+3 or the P5+1. But, by whatever name, one of the most important diplomatic negotiations of my lifetime. So, let’s get down to business. Dr. Zarif, it’s been written in the newspapers that you met yesterday with Secretary [John F.] Kerry here. There’s talk that you may actually be meeting again today for another meeting. And so I want to ask you in the way that Americans like to say, how’s it going? Mohammad Javad Zarif: First of all, let me say hello to everybody and it’s a great pleasure to be here. And, David, it’s good to have — to share this podium with you today. Actually we already met. We’re both early birds, so we met from 7 to 9 this morning. It indicates how much importance we attach to this process. We already met once as I arrived on Friday. And we met once today, and in the course of yesterday I had meetings with other members of E3+3 — Germany, U.K. and Russia. And I’ll meet [French Foreign Minister] Laurent Fabius after this meeting. We are engaged in a very serious discussion. The objective as [EU foreign affairs chief] Federica Mogherini just pointed out is rather clear. We set it out in the plan of action that we adopted — historic in my view — in Geneva in November of 2013 and that is the two objectives, which, in my view, is a singular objective, to make sure that Iran’s nuclear program remains exclusively peaceful. That means that Iran should, in fact, be able to exercise its right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, because without it exercising that right, it’s impossible to make sure that it’s peaceful. And secondly, to make sure that it’s peaceful. And by that it means that all the restrictions that have been imposed on Iran through sanctions, which we consider unacceptable, to be lifted. And it is important to recognize the fact that we need to move in this direction simultaneously. That is, as Iran takes steps to reassure the international community that it’s program remains peaceful — and the reason I use the word “reassure” is that over the last 10 years or more, Iran has been the subject of more IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections than probably any other country on the face of the Earth, and the IAEA has yet to find a single evidence that Iran’s program is anything but peaceful. So, we are prepared to reassure the international community — it seems that quite a bit of reassurance is needed for some of our negotiating partners, at least. But, at the same time, it is important that restrictions that have been imposed on the Iranian people be lifted. These restrictions did not achieve their intended result. You know that once, when the sanctions were imposed on Iran, Iran had less than 200 centrifuges. If the objective of the sanctions was to prevent Iran from developing its nuclear technology, they utterly failed because now we have 20,000 centrifuges. So we need to find another way, and I believe the E3+3 have come to realize that the only way to resolve this issue is through negotiations. And we have made quite a bit of success, and we make progress over the past many months. DI: So, so let me ask you. Knowing now that you got up early and had breakfast with Secretary Kerry for yet another round of discussions. Come back to that. How it’s going, and let me rephrase that. What would you say, as of this morning, after the latest, meeting are the principal remaining obstacles to completing the comprehensive agreement that was outlined in the JPOA [joint plan of action]? MJZ: Well, I guess Secretary Kerry will get his chance in the next panel to state his views. I believe that the most important obstacle to reaching an agreement is the need for realization that the only way to reach an agreement is through negotiations and through disagreement. This is, again as Mrs. Mogherini rightly pointed out, this is the opportunity to do it, and we need to seize this opportunity. It may not be repeated. And it is important for everybody to realize that the only way to deal with Iran is through respect and negotiations and meeting on a non-zero-sum game. If you look at the developments in the international scene over the past many years, we haven’t been able to resolve many problems and many crises because we have approached them from a zero-sum perspective. My gain has always been defined as somebody else’s loss, and through that, we never resolve problems. And I believe here we need to be able to define — and I believe I said this in this room last year — that unless we define mutual goals, shared objectives, common objectives, we won’t be able to resolve this. And that is how we approach this. We believe that it is in our interest to show the world that our nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. We define that as our objective, not the objective of the other side. We define it as our own objective, and that is why it doesn’t take a lot of sacrifice for us to show to the world that our nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. I believe the other side also needs to realize that imposing sanctions on the Iranian people has not only hurt the Iranian people, but has hurt the European economy, has hurt the American economy, has hurt the global economy — has not benefitted anybody — and it has not helped in the process either. So, we either lose together or win together, and unless we realize this, some people unfortunately believe that sanctions that have been imposed on Iran are an asset for them. I want to disabuse them of this. Sanctions are a liability. You need to get rid of them if you want a solution. And unless, particularly some politicians, unless they come to the realization that sanctions are a liability and they need to be lifted, we will not have a solution. So that’s the single most important issue, but I think we have made good headway in resolving even that. DI: I want to come back to the details of the agreement. And I’m going to, in particular, mark a mental note around the question of phase reduction of sanctions as a way to remove sanctions, but I want to step back a little bit. You’ve been seeing a lot of Secretary Kerry, and there was a picture that was taken of the two of you in Geneva when you were out for a stroll last January on the sidewalk, and a group of 21 Iranian parliamentarians are reported to have signed a petition. And I’m going to quote with your forgiveness from what was published in the Iranian newspapers. And the petition said your exhibitionist walk together with Kerry along Geneva sidewalks was certainly outside the norms of diplomacy [and asked] so why don’t you put a stop to such behavior? It seems that you have critics back home, judging from that petition. And so I want to ask you: What are your critics upset about? MJZ: Well, I think we need to realize the reality that Iran is not a monolithic society. And we like it. We have a variety of views, and they get a chance to express themselves. So that’s not bad. Secondly, there is a huge deal of mistrust in Iran vis-a-vis the West in general and the United States in particular. So every action that we take, every step, is under very serious scrutiny by our public because of that mistrust. So if you’re talking about lack of confidence or confidence deficit, there’s a lot to go around. It’s just not the West not having confidence in the Iranian program, and I don’t know why, but there’s a lot of reason — and I believe my colleagues in the West would understand that — from supporting Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war to overthrowing a democratically elected government in Iran and to whatever happened in between and afterwards that makes Iranians be at least skeptical of U.S. intentions. So anything I do is rightly scrutinized by our people, our parliamentarians, and I believe that’s the nature of the game and I’m ready for it. So I’ll go to the parliament, and I’ll explain what I was doing, and I will try to convince them that what I did was not outside the norms of diplomacy. That it had been done before, and it will be done — I mean people will do it in the future. But I give them every reason to be skeptical of everything I do. Because I’m actually taking very serious steps. Iran did not talk to the United States for 35 years. And now we are talking. And I believe these talks are useful. But they haven’t produced the intended results. We have not seen an end to the hostility that has been exhibited in the United States against Iran. And I believe it is important that we see some of that. But, unless we make progress, I give my critics in Iran every right to criticize me. And even if we make progress and if we reach an agreement, I believe there will be people in Iran who will remain skeptical of this. I believe they have every right to be skeptical. But they were skeptical about the joint plan of action that we adopted in Geneva. And IAEA report after another has indicated that Iran has lived up to all — and I underline “all” — its commitments under the JPOA. We have not violated or even misbehaved in one single incident. There is a difference of opinion in Iran, but what the government promises, it will deliver. DI: Will President [Hassan] Rouhani, as a leader of Iran who’s taken so many risks to sponsor these negotiations, will he be hurt if they fail? MJZ: Well, I want to correct a very wrong report by Reuters, unfortunately, that made [it seem] that those who talked to me in the past three days know that that was not a subject of our negotiations or discussions. DI: I should say there was a report that said that Dr. Zarif said this directly to Secretary Kerry yesterday. MJZ: And others. And the report predicted — this is news reporting — predicted that I’ll be doing it in the future. So, news organizations predicting the future is something new. But I didn’t — DI: — not so new. MJZ: Not so new. I mean predicting news is new. Analyzing is maybe not. But what is important is we have a very dynamic political system in Iran. I believe the entire Iranian population understands that this government — that Dr. Rouhani, his administration and the government in its entirety — particularly the leader of the revolution which today again supported our efforts in the negotiations, if only a few minutes ago. Everybody has taken every necessary measure to ensure that we succeed. All Iranians know this. If we fail — and I hope we won’t — they will not keep us or consider us responsible for that failure. They will consider attempts by asking too much from Iran as the reason for failure. But I’m not going to contemplate that. I’m not going to engage in a blame game; I don’t think a blame game is necessary. I think we will be talking about our success rather than our failure, and we will be looking for people to commend for success rather than people to blame for failure. DI: And what do you say, Dr. Zarif, to hard-liners. When I came to Tehran in December 2013 to see you, I visited Hossein Shariatmadari who is the editor of Kayhan [a newspaper in Iran], and he said to me essentially any concession to the West, any compromise, is an attempt to undermine our revolution, and I oppose it. And I want to ask you, what do you say as somebody who’s been deeply involved in the negotiations to people like that back home? How do you answer that criticism that says any compromise undermines us? MJZ: Well, I give them every reason as I said to be skeptical. I sympathize with them, I believe that — I’m skeptical. There is reason to be skeptical. But I believe that agreement and agreement in which there are no losers and no winners and an agreement in which the objectives of everybody is achieved is in the interest of everybody. In the interest of our region, in the interest of international peace and security and in the interest of Iranian scientific advancement. So, I don’t share that view, but I can understand and sympathize with his view about being forced into walking into these negotiations with a degree of skepticism and mistrust. And I believe the other side does the same. I mean, in Washington, people around you, in buildings close to you, are rather skeptical about our intentions, and they criticize Secretary Kerry and President Obama for what they’re doing. So we do not have a monopoly of skeptics. I mean the United States has them, too. DI: So I want to look with you, if I might, at some of the details that are before you with your next deadline coming, March 24. Quoting from the JPOA, which is the document that you already agreed to back in November 2013; it talked about a mutually defined enrichment program with practical limits and transparency measures. And it said that this comprehensive agreement would produce a reciprocal step-by-step process that would lead to the eventual removal of sanctions. So I want to unpack those ideas and start at the end with this idea of a step-by-step process of removing sanctions. Is that something — MJZ: — The step-by-step process does not refer to the removal of sanctions. You’re not reading the JPOA correctly. It says that it is a reciprocal step-by-step process, but the objective is the removal of sanctions, if you read the JPOA correctly. So, I’m not going to negotiate here certainly, but I believe sanctions have miserably failed at reaching their own objective. And removal of sanctions is a condition for an agreement, and I believe that condition can be met and will be met if we have an agreement. DI: But on this idea that it would be phased, is that something that Iran is prepared to discuss? MJZ: Again, I’m not negotiating here, but we will stick to the terms of the JPOA, and I do not believe that JPOA called for phased removal of sanctions. And if I had the text in front of me, I would read it to you, but I don’t, unfortunately. DI: I wrote down the text, and I could laboriously — but I will defer to the negotiator. So let me, since you don’t want to negotiate the details, let me jump to the basics — MJZ: No, I don’t want to negotiate the details here. I negotiate the details in the negotiating room. DI: I don’t know why you wouldn’t want to do this in this private setting. MJZ: You make the decision, final decision, I’ll negotiate with you right here. DI: So, let me cut to the thing that we all must think about and are concerned about, which is what if there isn’t an agreement by March 24 or June 30, the final deadline. And I’d be interested in your discussion of that and what we have in all of our minds, I think, is that, well if there isn’t an agreement, should we seek a little more time? Have we had enough progress that we can think maybe with a little more time we can get to where we want? MJZ: Well, first of all, I don’t think if we don’t have an agreement, it’ll be the end of the world. I mean, we tried, we failed, fine. We will think of other procedures. I hope it won’t be the same of each side trying to hurt the other without benefiting anything in the process. That’s basically what was done. So, it won’t be the end of the world, but I do not believe another extension is in the interest of anybody. As I did not believe this extension was even necessary or useful. But we did. And we’re reaching to the point that it is quite possible to make an agreement. I believe the same agreement could have been made three months ago, four months ago, six months ago. And I do not believe anything will be different a year down the road. So in my view, extension is not useful, not conducive to an agreement and all my energy and focus and that of my colleagues, and I’m sure my negotiating partners on the side of E3+3 are all focused on reaching an agreement at the earliest possible time. DI: That happy statement from Ambassador [Wolfgang] Ischinger was that we might have a little more time. So, if I hear you saying that you don’t think a formal extension is appropriate, if we’re not there, what about an informal stand-in-place situation. Often, you have that where you don’t have a formal agreement, but it’s in neither side’s interest to blow up the situation that exists. Would you think that would be a possibility, a likelihood? MJZ: David, I want to use the next six weeks concentrating on a solution, not concentrating on failure. And I believe it would be best if everybody concentrated on a solution. DI: So let me assume now that you’re going to get there. You’re going to get to a solution. And I want to ask you about what might follow an agreement. And, specifically, in a world that is being — in a Middle East that is being torn apart by regional conflict — a nightmare taking place around you, is there some way based on this process of negotiation, the broad conversations, that you might then move to regional issues? For example, some kind of security conference for the region would include Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United States, Russia — some way of talking about and beginning to resolve these terrible problems.

And these approaches need to be multifaceted and multi-dimensional and cannot be only military or political. They have to be cultural; they have to involve various actors.

Because these problems are pressing. These problems are pressing in our region; these problems are pressing in the world. These problems will be detrimental to the peace and security of our region, of our people and of the world. So, I don’t think we need any conditionality to engage in resolving these problems, which will be first and foremost a threat to our own livelihoods. DI: And what would you say, Dr. Zarif, to an Arab leader who, if he was being candid, would say to you, Iran or Iran’s proxies today control Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut, Sanna [Yemen]. We feel encircled. How do you speak to that anxiety, which obviously is driving this moment. MJZ: That would be over-aggrandizing Iran’s power and underestimating the will of the people. And that would be an insult to the people of all these countries. I believe our region, the problems in our region will not be resolved by trying to simplify the problems.

0,"IRANIAN FOREIGN Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, like several other senior officials in his country, has made it clear that he is uncomfortable with the detention of The Post’s correspondent in Iran, Jason Rezaian, who as of Monday had been unjustly held for 202 days. Asked Sunday about the case during a conference in Munich, Mr. Zarif said: “I hope he will be cleared in a court of law. . . . I hope once the court process is completed, we will have a clear-cut case or we will have his acquittal.” Those words might offer grounds for optimism that Iran will soon cease its outrageous mistreatment of Mr. Rezaian, a 38-year-old California native who, since being arrested with his wife July 22, has not been informed of the charges against him or been allowed to speak with a lawyer. Yet Mr. Zarif’s words are contradicted — as they have been in the past — by the actual developments in Mr. Rezaian’s case. Late last month, a human rights group reported that his trial had been referred to the court of a notorious Revolutionary Court judge known for imposing harsh sentences in political cases. As Mr. Rezaian’s family noted in a statement, Judge Abolghassem Salavati was sanctioned in 2011 by the European Union for “gross human rights violations.” In 2009, he sentenced two American hikers, arrested near Iran’s border with Iraq, to eight years in prison on groundless espionage charges. To suggest, as Mr. Zarif did, that Mr. Rezaian will be treated fairly in such a court strains credulity; it raises the question of whether the foreign minister was seeking to deflect an embarrassing inquiry with an empty expression of hope. Some analysts of Iran have speculated that the persecution of Mr. Rezaian is an attempt by “hard-liners” and their allies in the judiciary to undermine the “moderate” government of President Hassan Rouhani and the nuclear negotiations being conducted by Mr. Zarif. If that is true, the case raises a question about the talks: If Mr. Zarif is not able to obtain justice for an innocent journalist he has called “a good reporter,” can he be expected to obtain necessary concessions on a nuclear program that has been the focal point of Iran’s national security apparatus for more than a decade? Whether there is a power struggle in Tehran or not, the Rezaian case illustrates a profound imbalance in the nuclear negotiation. While an American citizen is openly wielded as a human pawn, at enormous cost to his well-being and that of his family, the Obama administration fastidiously refrains from any action it believes might offend Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — from seeking the downfall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to tolerating a vote in Congress on sanctions that would be imposed in the event the talks failed. Mr. Zarif asserted that he had “tried my best to help [Mr. Rezaian] in a humanitarian way, providing for his mother’s visit.” But such palliatives are not a substitute for justice. It’s time for him and Mr. Rouhani to use their influence to free Mr. Rezaian — and demonstrate that the Iranian government can deliver on its words.

While an American citizen is openly wielded as a human pawn, at enormous cost to his well-being and that of his family, the Obama administration fastidiously refrains from any action it believes might offend Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — from seeking the downfall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to tolerating a vote in Congress on sanctions that would be imposed in the event the talks failed. Mr. Zarif asserted that he had “tried my best to help [Mr. Rezaian] in a humanitarian way, providing for his mother’s visit.” But such palliatives are not a substitute for justice. It’s time for him and Mr. Rouhani to use their influence to free Mr. Rezaian — and demonstrate that the Iranian government can deliver on its words.

0,"Iranian prison authorities have allowed jailed Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian to get outside medical treatment and receive some care packages in recent weeks amid a groundswell of signatures on an online petition urging his release. Ali Rezaian, the imprisoned reporter’s brother, said Thursday in an interview that his sibling briefly left prison twice recently to see specialists who prescribed antibiotics for infections in his eye and groin area. “He’s feeling better,” said Ali Rezaian, who noted that the infections went untreated for more than a month. “But as a result of the delayed treatment, it’s harder for him to recover.” The 38-year-old Jason Rezaian, The Post’s bureau chief in Iran, has been held in Tehran’s Evin Prison since security forces raided his home in July and arrested him and his wife, journalist Yeganeh Salehi. She was eventually released on bail. Their case has been referred to a Revolutionary Court jurist known for imposing long and severe sentences. A dual national who holds American and Iranian citizenship, Rezaian has been detained longer in Iran than any journalist before him. The charges against him are cloaked in secrecy, with little public information beyond a statement by authorities that he is accused of acting beyond the scope of journalism. He has not been permitted to consult a lawyer. But there are signs that the prison authorities have eased at least some of the harsh conditions. He was recently released from solitary confinement and placed in a cell with another prisoner. He also has been allowed several visits from his wife, who brought him books, food and warm clothes fitting for the cold Tehran winter, Ali Rezaian said. He has read the books she brought him in January twice already, the brother said. State Department negotiators engaged in talks with Iran over its nuclear program have repeatedly asked for the release of Jason Rezaian and two other Americans also imprisoned there, plus information on another American long missing in the country. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s chief negotiator, has said he was instrumental in arranging two visits to Rezaian late last year by his mother and mother-in-law. It is uncertain whether U.S. officials will have many opportunities to press Rezaian’s case after late March, when they have said they must reach an agreement with Iran on major principles or there is no point in continuing the nuclear talks up to a June 30 deadline. Meanwhile, a burgeoning online petition drive has collected signatures from people in more than 70 countries asking Iran to immediately set Rezaian free. The petition on Change.org has collected more than 100,000 signatures, a dramatic rise from less than 10,000 just a few weeks ago. Ali Rezaian said he quietly posted the petition around the Thanksgiving holidays. But in mid-January, Change.org began aggressively pushing it through e-mail and its social-media accounts on Twitter and Facebook, said the Web site’s spokeswoman, Shareeza Bhola. “Online petitions show that a situation is not isolated,” Bhola said. “It amplifies voices calling for justice. It’s not just a few people calling for Jason’s freedom — it’s 100,000.” Ali Rezaian said he would love to see the petition get a million or more signatures, a goal he said he considers achievable. Then he paused and corrected himself. “I’d love to see Jason get out tomorrow,” he said. “I’d rather be able to take the petition down.

0,"The family of a Washington Post reporter imprisoned in Iran for more than half a year has engaged a prominent defense attorney known for taking sensitive cases involving Americans ensnared in legal issues in the country. The brother and mother of ­Jason Rezaian contacted Masoud Shafii, according to Ali Rezaian, the reporter’s brother. Reached by phone, Shafii confirmed that he had agreed to seek the court’s ­permission to take the case. Shafii represented three American hikers detained in Iran from 2009 to 2011 on accusations of spying. After his clients were released, Iranian security forces searched Shafii’s home and interrogated him for several hours, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. Rezaian, The Post’s Tehran ­bureau chief, has been held in Iran since July. The exact charges against him have never been made public, beyond a statement by officials saying he is accused of activities outside the bounds of journalism. The case of Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, a journalist who was arrested with him but later released on bail, has been assigned to a Revolutionary Court judge known for his harsh sentences. Iranian court officials have said the case is expected to proceed to trial sometime soon. During his almost   seven months in detention, Rezaian has never been allowed to see a lawyer. The Rezaian family initially had contacted another defense lawyer, Saleh Nikbakht, but he was never granted permission to see the detained journalist. Nikbakht said Friday that he had advised the family that another lawyer would be better for Rezaian. Ali Rezaian expressed hope that Shafii’s involvement would be a turning point in his brother’s ­defense. “After several weeks of searching we have found an independent lawyer to represent ­Jason,” he said. “Mr. Shafii is a well-respected lawyer with a history of working cases involving foreign nationals and dual citizens, and we believe he can effectively provide Jason’s defense. We have requested that Mr. Shafii go to the court as soon as possible to file the appropriate paperwork so that he can be registered as Jason’s lawyer, meet with Jason, review the case file and begin the process of defending Jason against these baseless charges.” In a statement, Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, called Rezaian’s continued detention “a gross injustice.” “We’re pleased that an Iranian lawyer is willing to take Jason’s case as it now proceeds to trial, and we are very hopeful that he can help,” Baron said. “It’s important to note, however, that Jason still hasn’t been able to see a lawyer,” he said. “His unwarranted arrest, his detention in a horrible prison for months without charges, the long period of inadequate medical care, the failure even today to publicly specify the charges against him, and the continued delay in granting him effective legal representation add up to a gross injustice.

0,"An arch-conservative member of the Iranian parliament and outspoken critic of the country’s centrist president has claimed that there is an “espionage case” against imprisoned Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and his wife. In remarks published Saturday by the Fars News Agency, Hamid Rasaei said the reporter and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, have been accused of working with someone in the office of President Hassan Rouhani. He said that they had masqueraded as journalists while “penetrating into the most sensitive sections at the president’s office.” “Who — through his correspondence — facilitated Jason Rezaian in carrying out his espionage-related activities by allowing him to circumvent important security checks?” Rasaei said.  [Read: Full coverage on Jason Rezaian’s detention in Iran]  Rezaian’s relatives and senior editors at The Post have said the journalist, who has been detained in Tehran’s Evin Prison since he was arrested July 22, was acting only as a reporter when he wrote stories that frequently focused on the lives of ordinary Iranians. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, ripped the latest allegations as a “farce and a sham.” “We expected to hear something preposterous as the case went to trial, and our expectations were exceeded,” Baron said in a statement. “Seven months have passed without Iranian legal authorities publicly outlining the allegations against Jason. Now we have someone outside the judiciary system making outlandish allegations that come with no evidence. This isn’t justice. This is a tragic farce and a sham.” A State Department official said late Saturday that “we are aware of Mr. Rasaei’s comments regarding the allegations against Mr. Jason Rezaian. Jason has been unjustly detained without charges in Iran for over 200 days and should be immediately released.” There has been a recent groundswell of support for Rezaian’s release through an online petition. On Thursday, Ali Rezaian said prison authorities have allowed his brother to get outside medical treatment for infections and receive care packages in recent weeks. The charges against The Post bureau chief, who holds dual American-Iranian citizenship, have never been fully explained, and Rasaei’s remarks offer the clearest indication yet of the severity of the allegations that the 38-year-old reporter is facing, along with his wife, who has been released on bail. Rasaei is a mid-level cleric but is considered a hard-line critic of Rouhani and his administration. He is among the parliamentarians who have raised objections to Rouhani’s efforts to ease or end international sanctions by negotiating limits on Iran’s nuclear program, a process that involves entering talks with the United States. Late last year, Rasaei told the Iranian news agency IRNA that the drop in the international price of oil, which pays for the bulk of Iran’s budget, is another form of sanctions intended to pressure Iran into concessions in the nuclear talks. He called for Iranians to support a “resistance economy” and not give in to pressure. Rouhani’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has been representing Iran in the nuclear negotiations with State Department officials, who publicly and privately have asked Iran to free Rezaian and other Americans held in Iranian prisons. Zarif has said he has worked to make Rezaian’s confinement a little less onerous by arranging for him to be visited late last year by his mother and mother-in-law. Zarif said recently that he hopes the issue will be resolved soon. But to a large degree, Rezaian’s fate is in the hands of the hard-liners.

On Jason Rezaian’s 233rd day in captivity, his brother, Ali, asked Tehran to temporarily free him to spend Nowruz, the spring solstice that begins March 21, with his wife and her family. “It’s a time for new beginnings,” said Ali Rezaian in a news conference at the National Press Club. “It’s a time for generosity and mercy.” The press club announced it was giving a press freedom award to Rezaian, The Post’s Tehran bureau chief who was arrested July 22 last year on charges that remain vague. The John Aubuchon Award, named after a past president of the club, will be presented at a dinner on July 29. “We expect Jason will be free to collect this award,” said John Hughes, president of the club. Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, were picked up by Iranian security forces who raided their home and carted away notes, laptops and books.

0,"If my Post colleague Jason Rezaian were home for his 39th birthday on Sunday, he’d probably be at his brother Ali’s house in Mill Valley, Calif., building Star Wars Legos with his 7-year-old nephew and dipping into some spicy guacamole. Later, he’d likely tuck into a bowl of Ghorme sabzi, a Persian green stew, and perhaps hatch plans with his high school buddies from Marin Academy to fly down to Arizona to see his Oakland A’s in spring training. But Rezaian won’t be doing that on Sunday, because he’s in prison in Iran. Rezaian, the American-born Tehran bureau chief for The Post, and his Iranian wife were taken captive by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps in July, and he remains in custody after spending most of the past eight months in isolation and without access to medical care or a lawyer. The Iranian regime hasn’t explained what he’s being charged with, and no wonder: Jason Rezaian’s only crime is being an American journalist. His imprisonment on undisclosed charges is an international outrage. But for Iranians, it’s also a tragedy. Rezaian, a dual national who is the product of an Iranian American father and a European American mother, had made it his life’s work to change Americans’ views of Iran, to show the world that his ancestral land does not deserve its caricature as a place of terrorists and nukes and flag burnings. The sad irony is that Iran’s treatment of Rezaian reinforces the caricature and cements Iran’s status as a rogue state that mocks human rights and ignores its own laws. U.S. officials are no doubt raising Rezaian’s case as they sit down in Geneva this weekend for nuclear negotiations with Iran. There’s every reason to link Rezaian’s case to the nuclear talks because it calls into question whether Iran’s elected leaders, the executive branch with which U.S. officials are negotiating, can be reliable partners if they have no control over Iran’s ayatollahs and their Revolutionary Guard. Iran’s elected leaders seemed as surprised as U.S. officials were that Rezaian had been taken prisoner, and Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has said he hopes Rezaian will be cleared. This week, 47 Republican senators caused an uproar with their premature letter to Iran’s government objecting to a nuclear deal that has yet to be inked. Those lawmakers, and their Democratic counterparts, would be more constructive sending their pen pals in Tehran a letter about Rezaian. The Post has raised the visibility of its efforts to free its correspondent. Foreign Editor Douglas Jehl, joined by Ali Rezaian, highlighted Jason’s plight Thursday in a news conference at the National Press Club and in 22 satellite interviews. A petition on change.org has amassed nearly a quarter-million supporters calling for Jason’s release. There certainly is no legitimate basis for keeping him. The charge against him is vague and implies espionage, which is absurd. “My brother had no other job than to be a journalist,” Ali told me Thursday. That job was good enough for Jason. His late father had emigrated from Iran long before the revolution and did well as a rug salesman, and the Rezaians’ Marin County home, with a swimming pool, was the hub for the extended family. The gregarious Jason managed to become captain of his high school basketball team even though he’s all of 5-foot-7. Rezaian became interested in journalism after meeting the late writer Christopher Hitchens in college at the New School in New York. Also in college, Rezaian studied Farsi, which he hadn’t learned at home. He took his first trip to Iran in 2000 and was enchanted; he spent more and more time there, eventually moving there in 2008 to be a freelance journalist. He joined The Post in 2012, and in 2013 he married Yegi Salehi, an English translator who became a journalist. The half-Persian Rezaian made it his mission to explain his ancestral culture to his homeland. “He really wanted to demystify the place, to tell the truth about the people,” Ali Rezaian told me, because he “realized that there’s a big difference between what people saw on TV in the news and in the movies and real life there.” His captors have instead shown the world that the Iranian regime can be every bit as thuggish as advertised. That may be just fine with the ayatollahs, who might lose their grip if Iran’s isolation ended. But hopefully Iran’s elected leaders will have the courage to insist on Rezaian’s release. Otherwise, it’s difficult to see how they get sufficient credibility to secure a nuclear deal, or anything else. And the Iran that Rezaian tried to bring into the world will remain a pariah.

Later, he’d likely tuck into a bowl of Ghorme sabzi, a Persian green stew, and perhaps hatch plans with his high school buddies from Marin Academy to fly down to Arizona to see his Oakland A’s in spring training. But Rezaian won’t be doing that on Sunday, because he’s in prison in Iran. Rezaian, the American-born Tehran bureau chief for The Post, and his Iranian wife were taken captive by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps in July, and he remains in custody after spending most of the past eight months in isolation and without access to medical care or a lawyer. The Iranian regime hasn’t explained what he’s being charged with, and no wonder: Jason Rezaian’s only crime is being an American journalist. His imprisonment on undisclosed charges is an international outrage. But for Iranians, it’s also a tragedy. Rezaian, a dual national who is the product of an Iranian American father and a European American mother, had made it his life’s work to change Americans’ views of Iran, to show the world that his ancestral land does not deserve its caricature as a place of terrorists and nukes and flag burnings. The sad irony is that Iran’s treatment of Rezaian reinforces the caricature and cements Iran’s status as a rogue state that mocks human rights and ignores its own laws. U.S. officials are no doubt raising Rezaian’s case as they sit down in Geneva this weekend for nuclear negotiations with Iran.

0,"The framework agreement on Iran’s nuclear program unveiled Thursday provided little hint about how a deal may affect the fate of four Americans detained or missing there. The Obama administration has made the release of the Americans, who include Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, another priority in its ties with Iran. In addition to Rezaian, who has been the newspaper’s correspondent in Tehran since 2012 and holds dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, the Americans include Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine detained since 2011, and Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor. Robert Levinson, a retired FBI agent who also had worked for the CIA, disappeared during a visit to Iran’s Kish Island more than eight years ago. While Iran has denied holding him, U.S. officials believe he has been in Iranian custody. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, speaking to reporters in Switzerland after negotiators announced the agreement on Thursday, said that U.S. officials had raised the fate of the Americans in every meeting with their Iranian counterparts. Asked whether the detainees would be released as a goodwill measure if a final deal can be achieved, Kerry declined to provide details but said officials remain focused on the issue. “We have a very specific process in place to try to deal with it,” he said. “We call on Iran again today, now, in light of this, to release these Americans and let them get home with their families.” Iranian security forces picked up Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, last July. Although Salehi was released after two months, Rezaian, 39, remains held at the notorious Evin prison in Tehran. During his 254-day captivity, he has not met with an attorney, and the government has not announced charges against him, his family said. “Now that the framework agreement is in place, we call on the Iranian leadership to review the evidence their underlings claim to have against Jason,” Rezaian’s brother, Ali, said in a statement. “If they do, we are certain they will see that Jason has done no harm to Iran. Otherwise, they should ensure the judiciary stop their inhumane delays, make public their case against Jason and let the World see why they have stolen 8 months of Jason’s life.” Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, said Iran’s handling of the case amounted to “state-sponsored injustice.” “Iran should have ended this cruel and unconscionable charade months ago, and with the talks now adjourned, there can be no excuse for further delay,” Baron said in a statement. “It is long past time for Iran’s leaders to demonstrate fairness and a commitment to abide by Iran’s own rules, which could only result in Jason’s immediate release.” Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that hardliners in Iran had used American hostages or prisoners, starting with the 1979 U.S. Embassy seizure, to exercise their influence and undermine those who favored greater engagement. If a nuclear deal is struck, “I think the likelihood of their release goes up, but it’s difficult to predict and each of their circumstances are different,” Sadjadpour said. Sadjadpour said that Levinson’s links to the CIA would likely make his release the most complicated. U.S. officials have been uncertain whether Levinson, who was reportedly in poor health, remains alive.

0,"Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter imprisoned in Iran for almost nine months on suspicion of espionage, is accused of passing on sensitive economic and industrial information about Iran, the Fars news agency said Sunday. Fars, a semiofficial outlet known for its ties to hard-liners in Iran, said Rezaian faces “security” charges in the Revolutionary Court involving allegations of espionage and acting against the national security. It said no trial date has been set. Fars reported that prosecutors allege Rezaian, who is The Post’s Tehran bureau chief and holds dual citizenship in the United States and Iran, gave economic and industrial information on Iran to Americans who were not named by the agency. It was unclear how Fars had obtained its information on the case against Rezaian, who was arrested July 22 and until recently had no access to a lawyer. “Selling Iran’s economic and industrial information at a time of sanctions is exactly like selling food to the enemy at a time of war,” Fars reported, referring to the international sanctions related to suspicions that Iran aspires to use nuclear fuel not only for energy and medical testing but also to build nuclear weapons. Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, called the espionage allegation “absurd.” “It has been nearly nine months since Jason was arrested,” he said. “Now comes word via an Iranian news agency that Jason will face espionage charges. Any charges­ of that sort would be absurd, the product of fertile and twisted imaginations. We are left to repeat our call on the Iranian government to release Jason and, in the meantime, we are counting on his lawyer to mount a vigorous defense.” Rezaian’s recently appointed lawyer, Leila Ahsan, told the Associated Press in Tehran that she could not comment on the charges­ her client faces. She said that she was recently able to visit Rezaian in the notorious Evin Prison. “He appeared to be in good health and spirits,” she told the AP. “I can see him anytime. Jason asked me to provide a strong defense. I’m in constant touch with his wife and family. I’ve requested that the court hold the trial as soon as possible.” The Fars report is the first confirmation of an espionage case against Rezaian and his wife, Yaganeh Salehi. In February, a member of the Iranian parliament who is an outspoken critic of President Hassan Rouhani, a centrist, told Fars that Rezaian had “penetrated” the president’s office, and he made an apparent reference to Rouhani’s nephew, who runs his uncle’s media office. Sunday’s Fars account went on at length about what it characterized as Rezaian’s personal and professional friendships with six Iranian journalists and human rights activists who are living in exile, most in the United States. It made a point of saying that two of them had attended the funeral of Rezaian’s father. One is Omid Memarian, a New York-based journalist who has written extensively and critically about the government’s case against Rezaian. They have known each other since they were journalists in the San Francisco area. ”We're friends,” Memarian said in a telephone interview. “Yes, I went to his father’s funeral. That’s what normal people do.” Memarian said he believes that hard-liners who control the Revolutionary Court are trying to besmirch Rouhani through his nephew. Rezaian’s brother, Ali, said Sunday that Iranians should be “embarrassed” at his brother’s lengthy detention. “After nine months of illegal detention, Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency has written a lengthy article about its displeasure at two of the attendees at my father’s funeral in California in 2011 and Jason’s acquaintances in 2006,” he said in a statement. “If this is truly Iran’s justification for Jason’s nine months of detention, all Iranians regardless of their country of residence or political affiliation should be embarrassed by this continued injustice and join our family, President Obama, the Washington Post, Muhammad Ali, Noam Chomsky and groups such as Reporters Without Borders, [the] Committee to Protect Journalists, Amnesty International and the nearly 400,000 people from 140 countries who have called on Iran to release Jason immediately.” Read more Muhammad Ali urges Iran to free jailed Post reporter Jason Rezaian Family asks Iran to free Post reporter for Persian new year Sketchbook: Still counting the days till justice for jailed Post reporter Jason Rezaian","Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter imprisoned in Iran for almost nine months on suspicion of espionage, is accused of passing on sensitive economic and industrial information about Iran, the Fars news agency said Sunday.

0,"WE’RE GUESSING it’s not a coincidence that the latest, disturbing report about Jason Rezaian, The Post’s unjustly imprisoned correspondent in Iran, comes just after the government of Hassan Rouhani accepted a preliminary accord on the country’s nuclear program. On Sunday, the Fars news agency, which is believed to be close to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, issued a dispatch saying that Mr. Rezaian faced charges of “espionage” and “acting against national security.” It went on to sketch a case against the reporter that would be laughable were it not being used to justify an outrageous human rights abuse. Not for the first time, Mr. Rezaian looks like a pawn in Iran’s domestic power struggle over the nuclear deal. That makes it all the more urgent that Mr. Rouhani demonstrate his ability to control his opposition by arranging Mr. Rezaian’s immediate release. Mr. Rezaian, who was born and raised in California, had been jailed for 265 days as of Monday, far longer than any Western journalist previously detained in Iran. In violation of Iranian law, he still has not been brought to trial, and prosecutors have never officially reported the charges against him. He was denied the lawyer chosen by his family, and his court-approved attorney has not yet met with him. Mr. Rezaian’s family and experts on Iran have been saying for some time that the delay and lack of transparency in the legal process likely reflect the fact that prosecutors have no plausible case against him and have been stalling while attempting to concoct one. The Fars report lends credence to that view. It claims that the 39-year-old journalist sold “economic and industrial information” to unidentified Americans. It then devolves into a long account of Mr. Rezaian’s relationships with exiled Iranian journalists and human rights activists. It cites as somehow significant the fact that two of them attended the 2011 funeral of Mr. Rezaian’s father — as if that could have had anything to do with espionage. One of those journalists, Omid Memarian, told The Post’s Carol Morello that members of the judiciary are attempting to undermine Mr. Rouhani by impugning his nephew, who is in charge of his media operation. A critic of Mr. Rouhani claimed in February that Mr. Rezaian had “penetrated” the president’s office. This, too, makes little sense.  What’s clear is that Mr. Rezaian continues to be held in Tehran’s notorious Evin  Prison long after Mr. Rouhani’s foreign minister,  Mohammad  Javad Zarif, described him as “ a good reporter ” and expressed the hope that “ he will be cleared in a court of law .”  Again the question arises: If Mr. Rouhani and his foreign minister cannot stop the persecution of an American journalist they know to be innocent, can they be counted on to deliver on the commitments they made in the nuclear talks?

0,"Jason Rezaian, a reporter for The Washington Post imprisoned in Iran for almost nine months, has had only one brief, cursory visit with his lawyer in advance of his upcoming trial, according to information provided by his family on Tuesday. Leila Ahsan, the attorney, told his family she and Rezaian met once several weeks ago in the judge’s chambers and were prohibited from discussing his case or the charges he faces, said The Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, who called the restrictions “Kafkaesque.” Ahsan was misunderstood when she was quoted by the Associated Press on Sunday saying that she could meet with her client “anytime,” Baron said in a statement. Ahsan’s remark, carried by the AP, was included in a Post article published online Sunday. Ahsan and her client have a scheduled meeting next week, but it will have a time limit of one hour, Baron said, and that will be the only consultation the court will allow before Rezaian’s trial. The exact charges that Rezaian faces have not been publicly disclosed by the court. But the semiofficial Fars news agency has reported that Rezaian, The Post’s bureau chief in Tehran, is accused of espionage related to the alleged passing of economic and industrial information to Americans at a time when Iran is staggering after years of international sanctions. Baron called the allegations “absurd” and denounced what he said is Rezaian’s “unacceptable lack of access to legal counsel.” Rezaian, 39, has been detained in Tehran’s Evin Prison since last summer. His wife, who also was jailed, has been released on bail. Two other journalists arrested at the same time have been freed. “The idea that Jason — or anyone — could be allowed only one hour with a lawyer before standing trial on serious charges is simply appalling,” Baron said. “These kinds of Kafkaesque restrictions reflect the abject unfairness that Iran has shown at every turn in its handling of Jason’s case,” Baron continued. “Jason is an accredited Washington Post journalist who has done nothing wrong, yet since his arrest last July 22 he has been subjected to harsh interrogation, months of solitary confinement, and to poor living conditions that have had a serious impact on his health.” “His case has been assigned to Judge Abolghasem Salavati, who has been sanctioned by the European Union for human rights violations,” Baron added. “Reports in the semi-official Iranian press have conjured fanciful and implausible allegations about Jason’s activities that are transparently absurd.” During negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, State Department officials repeatedly have raised the case of Rezaian and two other Americans imprisoned in Iran. Secretary of State John F. Kerry and The Post frequently have called on Iran to release Rezaian, who has had health problems exacerbated by his lengthy confinement. “We call again on Iran to demonstrate its commitment to fairness, justice and to following its own law,” Baron said. “Any fair review of the case against Jason could only result in his exoneration and his immediate release.” Ahsan was recently retained by Rezaian’s family after several other lawyers declined to take him as a client in the Revolutionary Court, where security cases are held. Salavati has earned a reputation as a hard-line judge for his harsh sentencing, including death sentences for about half a dozen protesters in the reform-minded “Green movement” following the disputed 2009 presidential election. No date has been set for Rezaian’s trial, according to Fars. But his family has learned it may be held as early as next month.","Jason Rezaian, a reporter for The Washington Post imprisoned in Iran for almost nine months, has had only one brief, cursory visit with his lawyer in advance of his upcoming trial, according to information provided by his family on Tuesday.

Two other journalists arrested at the same time have been freed. “The idea that Jason — or anyone — could be allowed only one hour with a lawyer before standing trial on serious charges is simply appalling,” Baron said. “These kinds of Kafkaesque restrictions reflect the abject unfairness that Iran has shown at every turn in its handling of Jason’s case,” Baron continued. “Jason is an accredited Washington Post journalist who has done nothing wrong, yet since his arrest last July 22 he has been subjected to harsh interrogation, months of solitary confinement, and to poor living conditions that have had a serious impact on his health.” “His case has been assigned to Judge Abolghasem Salavati, who has been sanctioned by the European Union for human rights violations,” Baron added. “Reports in the semi-official Iranian press have conjured fanciful and implausible allegations about Jason’s activities that are transparently absurd.” During negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, State Department officials repeatedly have raised the case of Rezaian and two other Americans imprisoned in Iran. Secretary of State John F. Kerry and The Post frequently have called on Iran to release Rezaian, who has had health problems exacerbated by his lengthy confinement. “We call again on Iran to demonstrate its commitment to fairness, justice and to following its own law,” Baron said. “Any fair review of the case against Jason could only result in his exoneration and his immediate release.” Ahsan was recently retained by Rezaian’s family after several other lawyers declined to take him as a client in the Revolutionary Court, where security cases are held. Salavati has earned a reputation as a hard-line judge for his harsh sentencing, including death sentences for about half a dozen protesters in the reform-minded “Green movement” following the disputed 2009 presidential election. No date has been set for Rezaian’s trial, according to Fars. But his family has learned it may be held as early as next month."
0,"Iranian authorities are charging The Washington Post’s Tehran bureau chief, Jason Rezaian, with espionage and three other serious crimes, including “collaborating with hostile governments” and “propaganda against the establishment,” according to his attorney in Tehran. Providing the first description of the precise charges against Rezaian since his arrest nine months ago, the lawyer said that an indictment alleges that Rezaian gathered information “about internal and foreign policy” and provided it to “individuals with hostile intent.” The statement, issued from Tehran by Rezaian’s attorney, Leila Ahsan, was provided to The Post by the family of the imprisoned reporter. Rezaian also is accused of collecting classified information, said Ahsan, who is believed to be the only person outside the judiciary to have read the indictment. The indictment says he wrote to President Obama, in an example of his alleged contact with a “hostile government.” The charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison. The Revolutionary Court, which handles national security cases, has not officially divulged the charges against Rezaian. They are known only by the brief description given by Ahsan after she met Rezaian on Monday for 90 minutes in the presence of an official interpreter. It was the first time Rezaian has been allowed to consult with a lawyer since his arrest on July 22. He has been incarcerated in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison, where political prisoners are held and interrogated. “All of the items and accusations are the ones that I mentioned and I cannot divulge details because the trial has not yet begun,” Ahsan said in her statement, citing the secret nature of the investigation. Ahsan said that the case file presents no evidence to justify the accusations against Rezaian and that the charges are related to his journalistic pursuit of stories about Iran. She added that her client “has never had any direct or indirect access to classified information to share with anyone.” The White House and the State Department criticized Iran’s handling of the case. “If the reports are true, these charges are absurd, should be immediately dismissed and Jason should be freed immediately, so that he can return home to his family,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. When asked why the administration has not required the release of Rezaian and two other Americans held in Iranian prisons as a condition for a nuclear agreement with Iran, Earnest replied that efforts to build support for a deal are “extremely complicated.” Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, described the charges against Rezaian as “scurrilous.” “It is absurd and despicable to assert, as Iran’s judiciary is now claiming, that Jason’s work first as a freelance reporter and then as The Post’s Tehran correspondent amounted to espionage or otherwise posed any threat to Iranian national security,” Baron said in a statement. Baron made an open plea for the Iranian judiciary and the judge in the case to exonerate Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, a journalist who was arrested with her husband and eventually released on bail. “The manufactured charges against Jason and Yegi that Iran’s courts are now putting forth represent propaganda, not justice,” Baron said. “The world will be watching; any just outcome to this tragic charade can result only in Jason and Yegi’s exoneration and immediate release.” The judge in the case, Abolghassem Salavati, has previously drawn international condemnation for his harsh sentences. The Revolutionary Court has not set a trial date for Rezaian’s case. His family has said they believe it may be soon. “A Revolutionary Court branch reviewing the case is dealing with many other cases, and will deal with this case when its turn comes,” Gholam Hossein Esmaili, the head of Tehran province’s justice department and a former chief of Evin Prison, told reporters, according to Iran’s official Islamic Republic News Agency. “It will then issue an appropriate verdict at a proper time.” Ali Rezaian expressed confidence in his brother’s innocence. “The more I hear about the evidence they are basing their charges on, the less I can believe that they have held Jason for nine months, or that he was detained at all,” he said Monday. “There’s no evidence that he had or tried to gain access to confidential or classified information. There’s no evidence that he did anything to injure the Iranian government in any way. I guess in a word it would be that it’s tragic that his and Yegi’s lives have been turned upside down.” Several Iranian news organizations have published lengthy articles in the past week about the charges against Rezaian, who is 39 and holds both Iranian and U.S. passports. Last weekend, the semiofficial Fars News Agency said he is suspected of passing on economic and industrial information, which it characterized as an act of espionage at a time when international sanctions have caused prices to rise for Iranian consumers. His access to legal counsel has been limited. Several lawyers contacted by Rezaian’s family declined to take the case. Ahsan was hired only recently, and until Monday she had had only an introductory meeting with him in a judge’s chambers. She told Rezaian’s family that their meeting Monday is the only one that will be permitted before his trial. In her statement, Ahsan said the court has rejected her arguments that he should be released on bail to prepare for his trial. “Considering that the investigation has ended, I believe there is no legal precedent for extending Jason’s detention,” she said. Baron noted that the judge assigned to hear and render a verdict in Rezaian’s case has been accused of violating human rights. “It is important to note that the judge, Abolghassem Salavati, did not permit Jason to choose his own counsel, rejecting several initial choices,” Baron said. “We continue to believe that Jason’s defense team should be permitted to grow to include additional lawyers of his choosing. “We call on Judge Salavati and the Iranian judiciary to depart from past practice and instead demonstrate to the world that they can indeed render a fair and impartial judgment in the Iranian system.” In a hint of the defense strategy, Ahsan said that Iran and the United States, despite their deep differences dating to American support for the shah before the Iranian revolution that deposed him, have never attacked one another, so under international law they are not considered “hostile” nations. That undercuts the charges of “collaborating” with hostile governments and writing to Obama, she said. During nuclear talks with Iran, Secretary of State John F. Kerry has repeatedly mentioned Rezaian, along with two other Americans of Iranian descent imprisoned there — Amir Hekmati, a Marine veteran from Flint, Mich., sentenced to 10 years for aiding a “hostile country” — a reference to the United States — and Saeed Abedini, a pastor from Boise, Idaho, sentenced to eight years on national security charges for establishing churches in Iran. Kerry also has asked for help locating Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared during a trip to Iran in 2007. The United States has never formally linked any of their cases to the negotiations, however. Ahsan made a passing reference to the ongoing talks resuming this week. “Even though legal affairs are outside the bounds of politics, I hope the nuclear talks and its developments will have a positive effect on a speedy release of my client,” she said.

0,"The following is a full statement from Washington Post’s executive editor Martin Baron on the charges against The Post’s Tehran correspondent, Jason Rezaian. After nearly nine months of indefensible silence, Iran’s courts have finally shed light on their supposed case against The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian, who has been held in the notorious Evin Prison since July 22. Jason’s lawyer, Leila Ahsan, was permitted to hold her first substantive meeting with Jason at the Revolutionary Court today in Tehran, spending 90 minutes with him in the presence of an official translator. Afterward, Ms. Ahsan issued a Farsi-language statement “based on the indictment’’ against Jason showing that he is being charged with four serious crimes, including espionage. We understand that these charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 to 20 years in prison. The grave charges against Jason that Iran has now disclosed could not be more ludicrous. It is absurd and despicable to assert, as Iran’s judiciary is now claiming, that Jason’s work first as a freelance reporter and then as The Post’s Tehran correspondent amounted to espionage or otherwise posed any threat to Iranian national security. Jason is an accredited journalist whose fairness and professionalism have earned him public praise even from Iran’s president and Iran’s foreign minister. Whatever its motive, Iran’s judiciary is presenting the claims that are transparently baseless. The charges include “conducting propaganda against the establishment,’’ “collaborating with hostile governments,” and “collecting information about internal and foreign policy and providing them to individuals with malicious intent,’’ according to the lawyer’s statement. If there is any hint of light in Iran’s levying of these chilling charges, it is that Iran’s accusations against Jason will soon be heard in the court of public opinion and also in a court of law, albeit in a Revolutionary Court before a judge whose unfairness has already earned him sanctions from the European Community for violations of human rights.

Jason’s wife, Yeganeh Saleh, who is also a journalist, also faces an impending trial on an equally baseless charge. In the more than 260 dark days that have passed since Jason and Yegi were detained, Iran has shown only disdain for the concepts of humanity, fairness and the rule of law that it purports to embrace.

0,"President Obama vowed Saturday night that the United States would not rest until a Washington Post reporter imprisoned for nine months in Tehran is freed. In a sober moment at the end of an otherwise lighthearted and jestful speech at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, Obama noted that journalists around the world are unjustly imprisoned for doing their work, including “our own Jason Rezaian,” who is The Post’s Tehran bureau chief. “For nine months, Jason has been in prison for nothing more than writing about the hopes and fears of the Iranian people,” Obama said. He noted that he had spoken with Rezaian’s brother, Ali, who was present at the dinner. “I have told him personally that we will not rest until we bring him home to his family, safe and sound,” Obama said. The president’s remarks were the most high profile of a growing chorus of calls on behalf of Rezaian, who faces espionage charges. Some Republican senators last week urged the administration to make freedom for Rezaian and three other Americans held or missing in Iran a condition for a nuclear agreement. The administration, however, has been reluctant to link their fates with the effort to block Iran’s ability to build nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies wanting to do. Rezaian’s imprisonment was noted at the beginning of the dinner when Christi Parsons, president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, noted that Rezaian is charged with the crime of “collecting information about internal and foreign policy.” “That is also known as practicing journalism,” she said. Obama’s comments marked one of the few times the president has personally mentioned Rezaian. Last month, in a speech keyed to the Persian new year known as Nowruz, he called on Iran to free Rezaian and the other Americans. Secretary of State John F. Kerry has repeatedly brought up Rezaian and the other Americans during months of nuclear negotiations. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has deflected questions about Rezaian, saying it is a judicial matter. Rezaian, 39, has suffered health problems and bouts of depression since he was arrested last July 22, along with his journalist wife, Yeganeh Salehi. She was later released on bail, but Rezaian’s multiple requests for bail have been denied. Their case was assigned to the Revolutionary Court, the venue for national security cases. A judge known for imposing extremely harsh sentences, including the death penalty for anti-government protesters, will hear the case. Though the court has never publicly revealed the charges against Rezaian, his lawyer has said he is   accused of espionage   and three other serious crimes against the state that she said stemmed from inquiries and contacts he made as a journalist. No trial date has been set, but his family has been told it may begin soon. Ali Rezaian said he was grateful Obama mentioned the journalist at the dinner and said he hoped it would “shine light on his case and help to bring him home.” In a statement, Rezaian called on Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to review his brother’s case and explain why the judge who approved his temporary detention order has been assigned to hear the case. “Iran's laws on all these issues are clear, but through deception and obfuscation, Jason’s captors have convinced the Iranian government to permit their continued illegal detention of an innocent man,” said Rezaian, who was introduced at the dinner as a “tireless advocate” for his brother.

0,"President Obama took a few humorous shots at the 2016 presidential field and at the news media — and a few at his own image — in his annual comic turn at Saturday’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. “I am determined to make the most of every moment I have left” of his second term, the president quipped in a line that drew laughter and a few startled reactions. “My advisers asked, ‘Mr. President, do you have a bucket list. And I said, ‘Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.’ ” The annual celebrity-politico meet-up at the Washington Hilton drew the powerful, the famous and the just plain well-connected to a corner of town Saturday night for an evening of gags and glamour. The black-tie Hollywood-on-the-Potomac party featured fewer big-name stars this year, but more than enough to create the one-of-a-kind mash-up of actors, senators, Supreme Court justices, business types — and, of course, the president and first lady. In his relatively brief comic turn, Obama likened Hillary Clinton’s nascent presidential campaign to Americans’ lingering uncertainty about the economy. “I had a friend making millions of dollars a year,” he said. “Now she’s living in a van in Iowa.” He tweaked himself and Republicans for inviting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak to Congress while the United States is negotiating a nuclear treaty with Iran: “I’m so old John Boehner has invited Netanyahu to speak at my funeral.” Turning to the media — which usually takes its lumps at the annual dinner — Obama noted that Cecily Strong, the evening’s entertainer, impersonates a CNN anchor on “Saturday Night Live.” “Which is surprising,” he said, “because the only people impersonating journalists on CNN are the journalists on CNN.” He added that this winter’s polar vortex produced “so many record lows that they renamed it MSNBC” — the cable network that has struggled lately in the ratings. Turning serious, Obama paid tribute to journalists Stephen Sotloff and James Foley, who were kidnapped and executed by Islamic State militants, and to Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who was “imprisoned for doing nothing more than writing about the hopes and fears of the Iranian people. I have told him that we will not rest until we bring him home safe and sound to his family.” In her remarks, Strong took aim at some of the same targets as Obama — the media, the candidates and Congress. Of the latter, she said: “It feels so weird being up here. I’m only a comedian, so I won’t tell you [politicians] how to do your job. That would be like you guys telling me what to do with my body.” As for the Secret Service: “I don’t want to be too hard on those guys. They’re the only law enforcement agency that will get in trouble if a black man gets shot.” The Washington Hilton lobby began filling with the beautiful and powerful — as well as a few actual White House correspondents — hours before the dinner, creating a logjam that pushed the event a half-hour off schedule before the 2,600 guests even sat down for dinner. The dinner, which began in 1921 as a modest affair for 50 correspondents (long before the commander-in-chief began attending) has metastasized into a weekend-long extravaganza, with media-sponsored parties before, after and even during the dinner. The dinner and its preliminaries were telecast live by Fox News, MSNBC and CNN, in addition to C-SPAN. The cable news networks largely put aside breaking news events in Nepal (site of a devastating earthquake) and Baltimore (site of an unruly demonstration against the local police force) to provide live coverage of red-carpet arrivals and the dinner itself. Crowds gathered outside the hotel to catch a glimpse of the Hollywood figures who’ve adorned the proceedings in increasing numbers for the past 20 years. But the star wattage appeared to be dimmed somewhat this year. The dinner was heavy with actors from programs set in and about Washington, such as “House of Cards,” “Veep,” “Scandal” and “Homeland.” Hence the contingent from “Madam Secretary,” a fake secretary of state, Tea Leoni, working the room alongside Madeleine K. Albright, a real-life former secretary of state. The two had talked about a wide variety of topics, Albright said, but on this night she was “explaining Washington” to her. Her particular advice to the actress: “Keep your eyes open.” Among others in attendance: New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, mogul Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), Broadway star Idina Menzel, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, actress Ashley Judd, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley (D), MSNBC host Al Sharpton, and ice skaters Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski. Jane Fonda attended, too, with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. The star attraction, as always, was the president, whose presence on the dinner’s dais all but guarantees a capacity crowd each year. President Obama’s comic stylings were followed this year by “Saturday Night Live” cast member Cecily Strong, one of only four women to be the featured entertainer in the event’s 94-year history. This year, the celebrities were even able to watch the celebrities; at the Thomson Reuters pre-dinner reception, a giant screen loomed over guests that live-streamed the red-carpet arrivals. The Bloomberg News party had its own studio inside the party. At the Yahoo-ABC party, Katie Couric schmoozed with Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and Chris Wallace, a Fox News host. Roland Foster, a former congressional staffer, dove in for a selfie with Scalia. “You’re awesome!” Foster told him.  The president’s annual comedy routine was months in the making, with input from top writers from “The Daily Show,” “The Colbert Report” and “Saturday Night Live,” among others. Roxanne Roberts and Jessica Contrera contributed to this report.","President Obama took a few humorous shots at the 2016 presidential field and at the news media — and a few at his own image — in his annual comic turn at Saturday’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. “I am determined to make the most of every moment I have left” of his second term, the president quipped in a line that drew laughter and a few startled reactions. “My advisers asked, ‘Mr. President, do you have a bucket list. And I said, ‘Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.’ ” The annual celebrity-politico meet-up at the Washington Hilton drew the powerful, the famous and the just plain well-connected to a corner of town Saturday night for an evening of gags and glamour. The black-tie Hollywood-on-the-Potomac party featured fewer big-name stars this year, but more than enough to create the one-of-a-kind mash-up of actors, senators, Supreme Court justices, business types — and, of course, the president and first lady. In his relatively brief comic turn, Obama likened Hillary Clinton’s nascent presidential campaign to Americans’ lingering uncertainty about the economy. “I had a friend making millions of dollars a year,” he said. “Now she’s living in a van in Iowa.” He tweaked himself and Republicans for inviting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak to Congress while the United States is negotiating a nuclear treaty with Iran: “I’m so old John Boehner has invited Netanyahu to speak at my funeral.” Turning to the media — which usually takes its lumps at the annual dinner — Obama noted that Cecily Strong, the evening’s entertainer, impersonates a CNN anchor on “Saturday Night Live.” “Which is surprising,” he said, “because the only people impersonating journalists on CNN are the journalists on CNN.” He added that this winter’s polar vortex produced “so many record lows that they renamed it MSNBC” — the cable network that has struggled lately in the ratings. Turning serious, Obama paid tribute to journalists Stephen Sotloff and James Foley, who were kidnapped and executed by Islamic State militants, and to Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who was “imprisoned for doing nothing more than writing about the hopes and fears of the Iranian people. I have told him that we will not rest until we bring him home safe and sound to his family.” In her remarks, Strong took aim at some of the same targets as Obama — the media, the candidates and Congress. Of the latter, she said: “It feels so weird being up here. I’m only a comedian, so I won’t tell you [politicians] how to do your job. That would be like you guys telling me what to do with my body.” As for the Secret Service: “I don’t want to be too hard on those guys.

0,"Iran’s foreign minister suggested Wednesday that a Washington Post reporter facing charges of espionage in Iran may have been asked to gather information by someone working for the U.S. government. Mohammad Javad Zarif, speaking at New York University, said an “overzealous low-level operative” may have tried to “take advantage” of Jason Rezaian, The Post’s Tehran bureau chief who has been imprisoned in Iran for more than nine months. Although Zarif provided no more specifics on the identity of an alleged operative, he said people seeking U.S. visas for themselves or relatives are vulnerable. “The fact is, there are people who take advantage of the needs of some people who try to get a visa to come to the United States, or for their wives to come to the United States, and make demands that are illegal and dangerous and damaging to the professionalism of a journalist,” he said. Rezaian, 39, is a dual U.S-Iranian citizen who was raised in California. His wife of two years, Yeganeh Salehi, is an Iranian citizen. She was arrested with him last July and has been released on bail until trial. Zarif was asked about Rezaian in an appearance at NYU’s Center on International Cooperation, where he was answering questions posed by David Ignatius of The Post. When Ignatius asked whether the impending conclusion of nuclear talks with Iran might be a good time for Iran to release Rezaian in the spirit of the moment, Zarif said that “my friend Jason” is accused of a serious crime and expressed hope that he would be cleared in court. Rezaian faces four counts of endangering Iran’s national security, including one espionage charge, according to a lawyer who agreed to take his case after several other attorneys declined. State Department negotiators trying to finalize a nuclear agreement with Iran have frequently brought up Rezaian’s case and those of other Americans imprisoned there. U.S. officials and senior editors at The Post have described the case against Rezaian as ludicrous. In response to a question about Zarif’s remarks Wednesday, a State Department official said, “We haven’t seen his exact comments and are not sure what he was referring to specifically, but any assertion that Jason was other than a hard-working journalist trying to tell the story of Iran and the Iranian people to the world is absurd.” Zarif compared Rezaian’s captivity to that of Iranians who are jailed in foreign countries while awaiting extradition to the United States on charges of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. One Iranian in that situation died in a Philippine prison, he said. “The Washington Post has a much better publicity campaign about Jason than we have about people lingering in prisons in Southeast Asia who committed no crime,” he said.

1,"PRESIDENT OBAMA offered encouragement to the family and colleagues of Post reporter Jason Rezaian last weekend, saying, “ We will not rest until we bring him home to his family, safe and sound.” We hope Mr. Rezaian, who had been imprisoned in Iran for 281 days as of Wednesday, will hear of the president’s words. More important, though, they should be weighed by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who must realize that the unjust detention of an American journalist is only harming his regime. The Rezaian case has become a showcase for Iran’s ruthless internal power struggles and the politicization of its judicial system. The 39-year-old reporter, who was born and raised in California but is an Iranian and U.S. citizen, has been described by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as “a good reporter” and a “friend.” Yet he has been held in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison since July 22, apparently at the instigation of intelligence and judicial authorities. Not until last week was Mr. Rezaian allowed a substantial meeting with his attorney. A statement she provided afterward said he was charged with four crimes, including espionage, “collaborating with hostile governments,” “propaganda against the establishment” and “collecting information about internal and foreign policy and providing them to individuals with malicious intent.” On Wednesday, Mr. Zarif suggested that a “low-level operative” for the U.S. government might have tried to “take advantage” of Mr. Rezaian by asking him to gather information. Both Post Executive Editor Martin Baron and the White House quickly pointed out that the accusations are absurd. As Mr. Obama said, Mr. Rezaian is guilty of doing nothing more than “writing about the hopes and fears of the Iranian people.” His attorney’s statement said the case file she read offered no evidence to back up the charges. But she also told Mr. Rezaian’s family that she does not expect to be allowed to meet with him again before his trial, making it difficult to prepare a defense. This blatantly unjust treatment is showing Iran to be a country where well-meaning foreign visitors, including potential Western investors, are vulnerable to being seized as hostages or used as pawns in power struggles they have nothing to do with. It shows that the judiciary does not observe minimal standards of fairness or even adhere to Iran’s own laws. It suggests that the government of President Hassan Rouhani cannot be counted on to deliver on its international commitments — including the prospective nuclear accord — because of its inability to control the intelligence services, Revolutionary Guard and other reactionaries. Mr. Obama has declined to make the release of Mr. Rezaian and other imprisoned Americans a condition for going forward with the nuclear accord. According to Haleh Esfandiari, a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center who was held prisoner in Iran for 105 days in 2007, doing so might play into the hands of those responsible for Mr. Rezaian’s detention, who may hope to use his case to block any U.S.-Iranian detente. But Mr. Obama should look for other ways to make clear to Mr. Khamenei that he is serious about the commitment he made to the Rezaian family.

0,"Masih Alinejad is an Iranian journalist living in New York and creator of the My Stealthy Freedom campaign on Facebook.  During an interview last month with TV host Charlie Rose, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif asserted that Iran doesn’t “jail people for their opinions,’’ a comment that was met with howls of protests from Iranian activists and journalists who have tasted the hospitality of Iran’s prison system. A photoshopped image of Zarif with a long wooden nose was circulated online. Journalist Bahman Ahmadi Amouei, who was jailed in the 2009 crackdown, challenged Zarif’s claim in an open letter on Facebook: “I testify that [President Hassan] Rouhani’s government and his foreign minister are lying about this issue,’’ he said, noting that he was subjected to psychological and physical torture while being held “because of his opinions and articles written in the country’s newspapers.” Stung by the reaction, Zarif offered an explanation on his Facebook page. He said his comments were only about Jason Rezaian, The Post reporter who has been imprisoned for more than nine months on espionage charges. He urged his critics to be fair and respect “national interests.’’ But whose national interests are we talking about? I’m an Iranian woman who was jailed at age 19, while pregnant, for helping to create a student newsletter — in other words, for having an opinion. Like too many others, I have been forced into exile, which has prevented me from seeing my family for six years, because of my opinions. At 30, I was barred from parliament for my work as a journalist exposing how much the lawmakers were paying themselves. After I became a columnist, I lost my position for a while for criticizing then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Such reprisals are not suprising to Iranian journalists, who are used to being threatened or called in for questioning. It’s a part of the job that creates internal red lines; if we express our opinions, there are consequences. I cannot even express an opinion in how I dress. Iranian women are required to wear a hijab headscarf. Last year, more than 3.6 million women received warnings from the police for wearing improper hijabs, according to officials. Through the My Stealthy Freedom campaign, I have connected with nearly a million people worldwide in an effort to challenge government-enforced hijab rules. For this, I’d unquestionably be jailed if I were to return to Iran. That’s what can happen in Iran when you express an opinion. And, as if to prove Zarif wrong, last week security agents arrested human rights activist Narges Mohammadi, the deputy director of the Defenders of Human Rights Center (DHRC), which was cofounded by Nobel Peace Prize recipient Shirin Ebadi. For what possible reason other than her views could she have been arrrested? This is not the first time Zarif has made comments that sound like an Ahmadinejad rant; in March 2014, for instance, he claimed that political executions do not take place in Iran. Zarif’s defenders will say that he’s one of the good guys. They argue that, for him to gather support from the hard-liners, he needs to secure a nuclear deal with the United States and to achieve his goal of ending sanctions and allowing Iran to rejoin the world, he has to lie every now and again. We all have to cut him some slack, they say. Privately and publicly, these supporters warn dissenters not to write in English so as not to undermine Zarif’s position. Nothing to see here, they say, let’s all move along. If you criticize Zarif, you are labeled a warmonger and a supporter of the sanctions. Let me shout out that I am against war and that these sanctions have devastated the lives of ordinary Iranians. But let me be frank: Zarif does what he is paid to do, which is protect the Islamic Republic of Iran. As a diplomat, he will defend the country’s unsavory human rights record. He will deny U.N. reports of abuse. He will back Iran’s judiciary as it keeps Rezaian and others in detention. He will defend the persecution of the Bahai religious minority. I’ve interviewed the families of dozens of protesters killed during peaceful demonstrations in 2009. I’ve interviewed the families of those executed for their political or religious beliefs. They — and too many others like them — are the ones who deserve sympathy and understanding. I’m against lies. Mr. Zarif, Iranians wish you success in your efforts to see sanctions removed and to reach a peaceful resolution to the nuclear question. But don’t expect us to applaud when you claim “national interests” trump human rights abuses against journalists, dissidents, religious minorities and women. We — the Iranian people — also want a negotiation to secure our rights and our freedoms.

0,"Washington Post reporter ­Jason Rezaian is scheduled to go on trial in Iran next week on “espionage” and other charges, his attorney said Tuesday, the latest step in a case that has drawn strong objections from President Obama and other U.S. leaders. Iran’s judiciary has set a May 26 trial date for Rezaian, The Post’s bureau chief in Tehran, who was imprisoned nearly 10 months ago. His detention has been sharply criticized by media watchdog groups and was raised by Secretary of State John F. Kerry at nuclear talks with Iranian diplomats. The Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, urged the court to open the trial to public scrutiny and denounced the “contemptible prosecution” of Rezaian. Since his arrest on July 22, 2014, at his home in Tehran, Rezaian has been allowed only a single meeting with his attorney — held in the presence of official interpreters. Iranian state TV, which also reported the trial date, did not specify whether the proceedings in a Revolutionary Court against Rezaian and two others — including his journalist wife — would be open to the public. The court, which hears cases involving state security, normally conducts its hearings in closed session. No charges against Rezaian were disclosed until April. The Associated Press, citing his attorney, Leila Ahsan, said the trial will include Rezaian’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, a correspondent for the National newspaper in Abu Dhabi, and a freelance photographer who worked for foreign media. The photographer’s name has not been made public. “The serious criminal charges that Jason now faces in Iran’s Revolutionary Court are not supported by a single fact,” Baron said in a statement. “The proceedings against him have been anything but fair and open — if they had been, Jason would never have been subjected to outrageous prison conditions, obstacles to selecting a lawyer, limited time to prepare a defense, and an inadequate window on the case that Iran plans to bring against him,” Baron added. “The absence of evidence against him should have led to dismissal of the case long ago.” Iranian officials have not publicly revealed the charges against Rezaian, 39, a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen. But Ahsan said last month that her client is accused of espionage and three other offenses against the state. She said authorities allege that the charges stem from inquiries and contacts he made as a journalist, but officials have given few details. Rezaian’s brother, Ali, said their mother, Mary, was allowed a meeting with him last week in Tehran’s Evin Prison but was denied a visit Tuesday despite pledges from the presiding judge that she could see her son on a “regular basis.” The reason for the refusal was not clear. At least two interrogators monitored the Thursday meeting, Ali Rezaian said. Jason exhibited no serious health issues but remains troubled by chronic problems stemming from high blood pressure, his brother said. Although no longer in solitary confinement, Jason has contact with only one other inmate and his jailers, Ali added. Their mother has sought permission to attend the trial, and the family has appealed for courtroom access for an observer from the Swiss Embassy, which represents U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran. “Even if the trial is closed, we want someone there watching on our behalf,” Ali said. Kerry has repeatedly raised the issue of Rezaian and other imprisoned Americans during months of negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has deflected questions about Rezaian, saying it is a judicial matter. A State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under agency protocol, urged Iran to “dismiss any and all charges” against Rezaian and allow openness in the proceedings. “We call on Iran to respect its own laws and abide by international standards of due process so that Jason can have a chance to refute any and all of the charges,” the official said. Rezaian, Salehi and two photojournalists were detained at the same time in July. Salehi was later released on bail, but Rezaian’s multiple requests for bail have been denied. The photojournalists also were later freed. “Against this backdrop of injustice, Iran must now belatedly demonstrate that it can act with openness and fairness,” Baron said in his statement. “The world will be watching, and we call on Iran to make these proceedings public and transparent.” Baron said that The Post has been seeking visas so a senior editor can attend the trial but that the requests “have gone unanswered.” “Any just proceeding would quickly acquit Jason and his wife Yeganeh Salehi of all allegations and grant them their freedom,” he said. Press freedom groups have denounced Iranian authorities for Rezaian’s detention. Last month, Reporters Without Borders called his arrest “completely illegal.” The judge assigned to the case, Abolghassem Salavati, has presided over several high-profile prosecutions, including anti-state charges against protesters arrested after widespread demonstrations in the wake of a disputed 2009 presidential election.

Iran’s judiciary has set a May 26 trial date for Rezaian, The Post’s bureau chief in Tehran, who was imprisoned nearly 10 months ago. His detention has been sharply criticized by media watchdog groups and was raised by Secretary of State John F. Kerry at nuclear talks with Iranian diplomats. The Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, urged the court to open the trial to public scrutiny and denounced the “contemptible prosecution” of Rezaian. Since his arrest on July 22, 2014, at his home in Tehran, Rezaian has been allowed only a single meeting with his attorney — held in the presence of official interpreters. Iranian state TV, which also reported the trial date, did not specify whether the proceedings in a Revolutionary Court against Rezaian and two others — including his journalist wife — would be open to the public. The court, which hears cases involving state security, normally conducts its hearings in closed session. No charges against Rezaian were disclosed until April. The Associated Press, citing his attorney, Leila Ahsan, said the trial will include Rezaian’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, a correspondent for the National newspaper in Abu Dhabi, and a freelance photographer who worked for foreign media. The photographer’s name has not been made public. “The serious criminal charges that Jason now faces in Iran’s Revolutionary Court are not supported by a single fact,” Baron said in a statement. “The proceedings against him have been anything but fair and open — if they had been, Jason would never have been subjected to outrageous prison conditions, obstacles to selecting a lawyer, limited time to prepare a defense, and an inadequate window on the case that Iran plans to bring against him,” Baron added. “The absence of evidence against him should have led to dismissal of the case long ago.” Iranian officials have not publicly revealed the charges against Rezaian, 39, a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen. But Ahsan said last month that her client is accused of espionage and three other offenses against the state. She said authorities allege that the charges stem from inquiries and contacts he made as a journalist, but officials have given few details. Rezaian’s brother, Ali, said their mother, Mary, was allowed a meeting with him last week in Tehran’s Evin Prison but was denied a visit Tuesday despite pledges from the presiding judge that she could see her son on a “regular basis.” The reason for the refusal was not clear. At least two interrogators monitored the Thursday meeting, Ali Rezaian said. Jason exhibited no serious health issues but remains troubled by chronic problems stemming from high blood pressure, his brother said. Although no longer in solitary confinement, Jason has contact with only one other inmate and his jailers, Ali added. Their mother has sought permission to attend the trial, and the family has appealed for courtroom access for an observer from the Swiss Embassy, which represents U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran. “Even if the trial is closed, we want someone there watching on our behalf,” Ali said. Kerry has repeatedly raised the issue of Rezaian and other imprisoned Americans during months of negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has deflected questions about Rezaian, saying it is a judicial matter. A State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under agency protocol, urged Iran to “dismiss any and all charges” against Rezaian and allow openness in the proceedings. “We call on Iran to respect its own laws and abide by international standards of due process so that Jason can have a chance to refute any and all of the charges,” the official said. Rezaian, Salehi and two photojournalists were detained at the same time in July. Salehi was later released on bail, but Rezaian’s multiple requests for bail have been denied. The photojournalists also were later freed. “Against this backdrop of injustice, Iran must now belatedly demonstrate that it can act with openness and fairness,” Baron said in his statement. “The world will be watching, and we call on Iran to make these proceedings public and transparent.” Baron said that The Post has been seeking visas so a senior editor can attend the trial but that the requests “have gone unanswered.” “Any just proceeding would quickly acquit Jason and his wife Yeganeh Salehi of all allegations and grant them their freedom,” he said.

0,"JASON REZAIAN, a journalist who was born and raised in California, moved to Iran in 2008 with the hope of promoting a better understanding of his father’s homeland. After joining The Post in 2012, he wrote about political and economic issues but also took on such subjects as Iranian baseball. He earned the respect of senior officials: Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, has called him “a friend” and “a good reporter.” Mr. Rezaian nevertheless is scheduled to go on trial Tuesday, along with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and a photographer, in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court. Arrested at home July 22, he has been held for 305 days as of Friday in the notorious Evin prison, where he has been subjected to harsh interrogations and suffered through long stretches of solitary confinement. The Post reporter appears to be a pawn in Iran’s internal power struggles or in the leadership’s attempt to show that a prospective nuclear accord will not alter its enmity toward the United States, or perhaps both. Very little about his case is transparent: His lawyer has been allowed to meet with him only once and said she learned of the trial date through the media. What is absolutely clear is that Mr. Rezaian is entirely innocent of the charges, including espionage, that have been lodged against him. The State Department and White House, which normally refuse to comment on spying cases, have described the allegations against Mr. Rezaian as ludicrous; President Obama has said that he is guilty of nothing more than “writing about the hopes and fears of the Iranian people.” As Post Executive Editor Martin Baron observed in a recent statement, the charges “are not supported by a single fact.” As we have observed before, the treatment of Mr. Rezaian raises disturbing questions about a regime that Mr. Obama is counting on to implement a complex and multifaceted accord limiting its nuclear activities. If a U.S. citizen recognized by senior Iranian officials as a reputable journalist can be abruptly imprisoned on spurious charges, what treatment will be accorded the international inspectors who have to determine whether Iran is respecting its commitments? If Mr. Zarif and President Hassan Rouhani either countenance or cannot stop such blatantly provocative behavior by the Iranian intelligence services and judiciary, how can they be expected to overcome the entrenched resistance to limiting Iran’s uranium enrichment? Since the preliminary nuclear deal was announced April 2, Iranian leaders have engaged in an aggressive campaign to bully the United States and its partners into weakening its terms. Tehran first insisted that all sanctions against Iran must be lifted immediately, notwithstanding an agreement that they would be relaxed gradually as Iran fulfilled its initial commitments. On Wednesday, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei declared that inspectors would not be allowed to visit military sites or interview nuclear scientists — two essential steps for completing a provision of the accord requiring Iran to explain its suspected work on nuclear warheads. Placing Mr. Rezaian on trial just 35 days before the deadline for completing the accord looks like yet another attempt at intimidation — one that relies on the blatant abuse of the human rights of an American journalist. If Mr. Khamenei were serious about defusing Iran’s confrontation with the West, he would instead release Mr. Rezaian — and offer him the apology he deserves.

0,"Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian will go on trial Tuesday on espionage charges in a Tehran courtroom that will be closed to the public, including his family. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, said in a statement released Monday that both Rezaian’s mother and his wife, a journalist who also faces related charges and will be tried separately, have been barred from attending. The Post tried to obtain a visa for an editor to be in Iran during Rezaian’s trial, but its inquiries were not answered, Baron said. In recent days, the State Department and the Committee to Protect Journalists have called on Iran to open the proceedings in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court to the public, to no avail. The court’s spokesman told reporters in Tehran that only the judge in the case can decide to make a trial public or comment on it. “This decision by the trial to be open to the public or closed is dependent on the judge’s decision based on the content of the file case, and no one else can comment on it,” he said. Baron called the treatment of Rezaian in the Iranian justice system “shameful” and “disgraceful.” “There is no justice in this system, not an ounce of it, and yet the fate of a good, innocent man hangs in the balance,” Baron said. “Iran is making a statement about its values in its disgraceful treatment of our colleague, and it can only horrify the world community.” The trial of Rezaian, The Post’s Tehran bureau chief who was born and raised in California and holds dual citizenship, is the climax of his 10 months in detention since he was arrested July 22. During months of nuclear negotiations with Iran, the State Department has repeatedly raised the case of Rezaian and two other Americans already convicted in Iran, former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati and pastor Saeed Abedini, as well as a missing former FBI agent, Robert Levinson. Rezaian’s case has attracted international condemnation, in part because several journalist organizations have campaigned on his behalf. “Iran must end this travesty of justice immediately,” said Sherif Mansour, Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. “After more than 300 days of unwarranted detention, the least Iran could do is to release Rezaian on bail and grant his employer entry to the country and access to the legal proceedings.” It is difficult to know exactly what the case against Rezaian is based upon, because the proceedings have been secretive. What is known comes mostly from sparse Iranian media accounts and from what Rezaian’s brother, Ali, has said. Rezaian has been held in Evin Prison, notorious as a place where political prisoners and journalists have been taken for interrogation. His initial months were spent in solitary, and he suffered health problems exacerbated by his lengthy confinement, although he eventually was allowed outside to see physicians. His case was assigned to a judge known for his harsh sentencing in the past, which has included the death penalty for anti-government protesters. Rezaian’s family had to seek out several lawyers before recently finding one who agreed to take the case and who the court would accept as counsel. They have met only once to discuss the case, for about 90 minutes. She has told the Iranian media that Rezaian is accused of four serious charges including espionage in what she said stemmed from his journalistic pursuits. “No evidence has ever been produced by prosecutors or the court to support these absurd charges,” Baron said Monday. “The trial date was only disclosed to Jason’s lawyer last week. And now, unsurprisingly but unforgivably, it turns out the trial will be closed.” Rezaian’s mother, Mary Rezaian, has been in Tehran for the past two weeks hoping to attend her son’s trial, but she will not be permitted in the courtroom, according to Baron. Nor will his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, an Iranian national who was arrested along with Rezaian and later released on bail.

0,"Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian went on trial Tuesday on espionage and other charges in a closed Tehran courtroom more than 10 months after he was imprisoned, but the proceedings were adjourned without any indication of when they would resume. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Abolghassem Salavati, a judge known for draconian sentences, read the four-count indictment in a two-hour session in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court. The semiofficial Mehr News Agency said Rezaian roundly denied having done anything outside the normal activities of a news reporter. “I am a journalist, and all of my activities have been conducted as a journalist, and all were legal,” Mehr quoted him as saying when the judge asked about his contacts with U.S. Consulate officials in Dubai, where Rezaian’s family says he was seeking a visa for his Iranian-born wife. It could not be determined from the Mehr account whether the news agency, which is affiliated with the government, had a reporter in the courtroom. Rezaian’s attorney, Leila Ahsan, told the family that the trial would continue “at a later session,” according to Rezaian’s brother, Ali Rezaian. It was not clear whether another court date has been set or whether Ahsan was not permitted to say more. Under Iranian law, it is illegal to reveal details about a closed-door hearing. The defendant’s mother, Mary Rezaian, and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, a reporter for the National newspaper in Abu Dhabi, were nearby during the proceedings. Rezaian may not have even been aware of their proximity. His mother traveled to Tehran two weeks ago hoping to attend his trial, but her request was denied. The women went to the courthouse Tuesday. However, they were not allowed access to the floor where the proceedings were held, Ali Rezaian said. After they waited for about five hours, he said, a clerk informed them that the proceedings had ended. They did not get to see Jason Rezaian, even from afar. He apparently entered and exited the courthouse through a back door, his brother said, based on Iranian news accounts and the few details Ahsan could share. “We have absolutely no idea what happened in court, other than the fact the indictment against Jason was read,” Ali Rezaian said. The closed-door nature of the trial has been condemned by journalism organizations, The Washington Post and the State Department. “It certainly adds to concerns, and it fits, unfortunately, into a pattern of a complete lack of transparency and lack of due process that we’ve seen since Jason was detained,” said Jeff Rathke, deputy spokesman for the State Department. “While we call for it to be open, we also maintain he never should have been held and tried in the first place.” Rathke said the State Department is “monitoring” the progress of Rezaian’s trial, a task he acknowledged is difficult because no outsiders are allowed in the courtroom.He called for “all of the absurd charges to be dropped and for Jason Rezaian to be released immediately.” Rezaian, 39, is The Post’s Tehran bureau chief. He was arrested July 22, along with his wife and two photojournalists. All but Rezaian have been released on bail. Rezaian was born and raised in California, but he holds Iranian as well as U.S. citizenship. The government in Tehran does not recognize dual nationality and contends that Washington has no legal standing to press for his release. Rezaian has been accused of espionage and propaganda against Iran. He faces four charges that carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The Post has vigorously protested his detention. During months of nuclear negotiations with Iran, the State Department has repeatedly raised the cases of Rezaian and two Americans already convicted in Iran: former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati and pastor Saeed Abedini, as well as a missing former FBI agent, Robert Levinson. The four Americans have been mentioned on the sidelines of the talks, however, and it does not appear that their release would be a condition for a nuclear deal with Iran.

0,"A piece of evidence introduced in the Tehran trial of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian is an online job application for a position in the Obama administration that the journalist submitted unsuccessfully in 2008, The Post’s executive editor said Thursday. In a statement, Martin Baron cited recent accounts in Iranian and U.S. news media that the Revolutionary Court where Rezaian is being tried on espionage and other charges is weighing correspondence between Rezaian and the administration after Obama was first elected. Rezaian at the time was working in Iran as a freelance journalist. Baron said that the reports were “incomplete” and that he wanted to set the record straight. “Shortly after the 2008 election of President Obama, more than three years before Jason began working for The Post, he applied online for a job in the incoming Obama administration, citing his familiarity with Iran and a wide cross-section of Iranian society,” Baron said. “Jason received an unsigned, form response by e-mail and was never hired. Instead, he continued his work as a freelance journalist in Tehran until he began reporting for The Post in 2012 as the newspaper’s full-time Tehran correspondent. Jason never wrote directly to President Obama and was never hired by the Obama administration.” Rezaian, who has been imprisoned in Iran since his arrest more than 10 months ago, is charged with being a spy and disseminating propaganda against the “establishment” in Iran. According to a report by the semiofficial Mehr News Agency on Tuesday, the day Rezaian’s trial officially started, the judge mentioned the correspondence as evidence that the Post reporter was acting on behalf of the U.S. government. The judge also questioned visits Rezaian made to the U.S. Consulate in Dubai to apply for a visa for his wife, an Iranian national, to come to the United States. Rezaian denied that he was serving as a government agent, saying he had only ever acted as a journalist in Iran, according to the Mehr report.

0,"The rebel group that has seized power in Yemen has taken at least four U.S. citizens prisoner, according to U.S. officials who said that efforts to secure the Americans’ release have faltered. One of the prisoners had been cleared for release in recent days only to have that decision reversed by members of the Houthi rebellion that toppled the U.S.-backed government earlier this year and now controls most levers of power in Yemen. The Americans are believed to be held at a prison in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, which has been bombed repeatedly as part of an air campaign led by Saudi Arabia aimed at dislodging the Houthis from power. The United States has provided intelligence support to that operation. The detention of the Americans has complicated U.S. efforts to navigate the chaotic aftermath of the Houthi takeover, which displaced a government that had cooperated extensively with the United States on drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations against a dangerous al-Qaeda affiliate in the country. U.S. officials said three of the prisoners worked in private­sector jobs and that a fourth, whose occupation is unknown, has dual U.S.-Yemeni citizenship. The officials said none of the four were employees of the U.S. government. The Washington Post is withholding some details about the prisoners at the request of U.S. officials and relatives who cited concerns for their safety. A fifth U.S. citizen, Sharif Mobley, is also in Houthi custody, in connection with terrorism­related charges brought against him by the previous government more than five years ago. Mobley’s incarceration has been previously reported. The recently detained prisoners are among dozens of U.S. citizens who were either unable to leave Yemen or chose to remain in the country after the U.S. government closed its embassy in February and began pulling out its employees and U.S. military personnel. Details of the Americans’ detention remain murky, including where they are being held and whether they are together. In part this lack of detail is because there is little if any direct exchange of information between the United States and the Houthi movement, which has frequently employed chants of “Death to America.” With no formal contact, U.S. officials said efforts to secure the prisoners’ release have gone mainly through intermediaries, including humanitarian groups that continue to have a presence in Sanaa. U.S. officials said there is no indication that the prisoners have been physically harmed or are being treated as hostages. Still, they expressed concern about the well-being of one of the prisoners, who began to behave erratically in recent days as efforts to arrange for his departure unraveled. The prisoner was initially detained “because he overstayed his visa,” a senior U.S. official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. But Houthi leaders early this week cleared him for release, with flights arranged by the International Organization for Migration. The Houthis abruptly withdrew that travel authorization on May 27, however, and accused the prisoner of having traveled without permission to “sensitive” regions in the country, the U.S. official said. Among those locations, the official said, was Abyan province in southern Yemen, which has been a stronghold for al-Qaeda fighters who are adversaries of the Houthis. After being returned to a Yemeni prison, the American “acted as if he were mentally unstable” and removed his clothes, the U.S. official said, citing reports from sources in the Yemeni capital. A member of the prisoner’s family declined to comment when reached by phone on Friday. The Houthis are part of a Shiite sect that receives backing from the government of Iran. The United States and Iran are engaged in tense negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program, and U.S. officials have denounced Iran’s detention and trial of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. But U.S. officials said there have been no contacts with Iran over the Americans being held in Yemen. Saudi airstrikes have reportedly killed more than 1,600 people in Yemen over the past several months. In telephone conversations with his lawyers, Mobley has said he is being held in an area of the capital that has been targeted repeatedly. The site appears to have been struck again this week, killing 40 people, according to a statement released Friday by the Reprieve organization, which has represented Mobley. “This raises some pretty disturbing questions about U.S. support for the bombing campaign,” said Namir Shabibi, a Reprieve official. Shabibi said that Reprieve has repeatedly asked U.S. officials to persuade the Saudis to avoid bombing Mobley’s location, but that “given the established Saudi record of hitting the same spot multiple times, there’s a high risk Sharif will be hit again.” Julie Tate contributed to this report.","The rebel group that has seized power in Yemen has taken at least four U.S. citizens prisoner, according to U.S. officials who said that efforts to secure the Americans’ release have faltered. One of the prisoners had been cleared for release in recent days only to have that decision reversed by members of the Houthi rebellion that toppled the U.S.-backed government earlier this year and now controls most levers of power in Yemen. The Americans are believed to be held at a prison in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, which has been bombed repeatedly as part of an air campaign led by Saudi Arabia aimed at dislodging the Houthis from power. The United States has provided intelligence support to that operation. The detention of the Americans has complicated U.S. efforts to navigate the chaotic aftermath of the Houthi takeover, which displaced a government that had cooperated extensively with the United States on drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations against a dangerous al-Qaeda affiliate in the country. U.S. officials said three of the prisoners worked in private­sector jobs and that a fourth, whose occupation is unknown, has dual U.S.-Yemeni citizenship. The officials said none of the four were employees of the U.S. government. The Washington Post is withholding some details about the prisoners at the request of U.S. officials and relatives who cited concerns for their safety.

1,"The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday called on Iran to release three Americans imprisoned there, including a Washington Post reporter, and provide information on a fourth who is missing. After hearing from relatives frustrated that the fate of the four is not a central part of nuclear negotiations with Iran, most committee members said they would not support an agreement without freedom for the jailed Americans. “Congress should get real serious,” said Rep. Randy Weber (R-Tex.). “No agreement, period, until Iran releases the hostages. I hope John Kerry, President Obama, everybody on their team comes to their senses and says if human rights is not the main thing with this regime, how can you trust them with anything else?” The hearing comes at a critical time in the Iran nuclear talks. Negotiators for Iran and six world powers, led by the United States, are racing to make a deal before a temporary accord expires June 30. The deadline hung over the testimony as the relatives said they feared pressure on Iran could slip away once the talks conclude. “We do worry that regardless of the outcome of the deal, [there] won’t be a sense of urgency to get any of our family members home anymore,” said Daniel Levinson, the son of Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007 while working as a contract employee for the CIA. Naghmeh Abedini, whose husband, Saeed Abedini, was sentenced to eight years in prison for conducting Bible-study gatherings, said June is a critical month for her husband’s fate. “If we don’t get the Americans out, I don’t know when we will have more leverage,” she said. “This is a very crucial time.” Some committee members said Iran was showing contempt for the United States by putting Post reporter Jason Rezaian on trial last month. The Post’s Tehran bureau chief was arrested more than 10 months ago, and his trial started May 26, then was abruptly adjourned. His older brother, Ali Rezaian, said the court-appointed lawyer has been informed that the trial on espionage and other charges will resume Monday. Committee members said the timing of Rezaian’s trial was no coincidence. “We hope at this crucial junction, with less than a month to go before an agreement with Iran, this is the time to bring forward the cases,” said Rep. Eliot L. Engel of New York, the senior Democrat on the committee. “That they dare to put someone on a show trial, it just infuriates me.” Ali Rezaian praised the committee for highlighting the plight of the four Americans. “Let me be very clear,” he said. “The charges against Jason are false. Jason did sometimes write about Iran’s domestic and foreign policy, but this is perfectly legal conduct and recognized the world over as practicing journalism.” Some of the family members laid out the mathematics of their predicament. Ali Rezaian noted that his brother had been in prison for 315 days. Daniel Levinson said 3,007 days had passed since his father’s disappearance. Sarah Hekmati said the trial of her brother, Amir Hekmati, on an accusation of spying lasted 15 minutes before he was given a death sentence, which was commuted on appeal to 10 years. Unlike some of the relatives testifying beside her, Sarah Hekmati had not waged an ambitious public campaign drawing attention to her brother’s almost four years in prison. She said Iranian and U.S. officials initially advised her family not to publicly discuss her brother, a former Marine arrested four years ago on his first visit to the country where his parents were born. Officials in both countries told the Hekmatis that talking to the news media would politicize Amir’s case and place him in danger, Hekmati said. “Our family has learned that our silence allowed him to suffer the worst torture imaginable,” she said. The State Department has raised the plight of the Americans at virtually every round of talks, but always on the sidelines, not in the formal negotiations. State Department officials have said the talks about curbing Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for easing sanctions are for the global good, and they have resisted calls in Congress to make the prisoners’ release a precondition for a deal. Several members of the committee, and some of the family members, criticized that strategy. “Why we’re here now is not about centrifuges, PMD or snapbacks,” said Rep. Theodore E. Deutch (D-Fla.), citing some of the technical terms involving nuclear weapons and sanctions. “It’s about respect for human rights, it’s about dignity, and it’s about justice.” Asked what she would say to Iranian officials, Abedini said: “No more discussions till you first release the Americans. Then we’ll talk further.” The language used to describe Iran was frequently harsh. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) likened Iranian diplomats to the students who held American diplomats hostage during the 444-day occupation of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran that ended in early 1981. “The only difference is today the terrorists and thugs wear suits and give the illusion of being international diplomats,” he said.","The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday called on Iran to release three Americans imprisoned there, including a Washington Post reporter, and provide information on a fourth who is missing.

0,"Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian faced an Iranian court to defend himself against charges, including espionage, during a second closed-door session in Tehran on Monday. Rezaian, who has been detained since July, has strongly rejected the allegations in previous statements made public via his family and Iranian media accounts. Iran’s semi-official Tasnim News Agency said Rezaian, a California native who has dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship because his father was born in Iran, presented part of his defense in English during the hearing in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court. His statements were translated for the judge. No reporters were in court, and the media accounts from Tehran provided no details of Rezaian’s statements in court. His attorney, Leila Ahsan, said she cannot publicly discuss the court proceedings. Under Iranian law, it is illegal to reveal details about a closed-door hearing. “The second hearing in the trial of Jason Rezaian was held today examining the charges against him. Jason was in good spirits,” Ahsan told the Rezaian family, according to the reporter’s brother, Ali Rezaian. Only a few, sparse details have emerged from the legal proceedings against Rezaian, 39, The Post’s Tehran bureau chief. And legal authorities appear to be trying to crack down on reporting on the case. The Iranian Students News Agency on Monday quoted Iran’s prosecutor general, Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei, as saying that his office plans to investigate and prosecute another news agency that described parts of Rezaian’s first closed-door court appearance last month. The semi-official Mehr news agency quoted Rezaian professing his innocence in court and reported that among the evidence against him was a visit he made to a U.S. consulate seeking a visa for his Iranian-born wife and a letter he wrote to President Obama in 2008 — material that was apparently taken from his confiscated laptop. It is not known how Mehr obtained information from a court session from which the media and public were barred. “Based on the current laws, making public the events of even a public trial is illegal,” Ejei said. “Not to mention that [Rezaian’s] trial is closed-session.” There is no indication that anyone from Mehr has been called to the prosecutor’s office. Many other Iranian news agencies, all of which have ties to the government, have published some details about the case, and none has been prosecuted or ordered to stop reporting. Monday’s session finished after about three hours, and it is unclear whether a third hearing has been scheduled. Rezaian’s mother, Mary Breme Rezaian, described her son as “very tired, very distressed.” Rezaian’s mother has been in Tehran for nearly a month and has been allowed to see her son twice during brief and monitored visits, the family said. She was not allowed in the courtroom Monday. Iran’s official Islamic Republic News Agency said two other suspects appeared in court with Rezaian. Their identities were not immediately known. Rezaian’s wife — Yeganeh Salehi, also a journalist — and a photographer have been charged on related allegations. But Salehi accompanied Rezaian’s mother on Monday, the Associated Press reported. The closed-door trial has been condemned by journalism organizations, The Post and the State Department. Deane reported from Rome and Murphy from Washington.

0,"Washington’s Newseum on Monday inducted the newest members into a club that none of us would want to join: journalists who died covering the news around the world. The Class of 2014 in the museum’s Journalists Memorial includes my colleague Michel du Cille, who died of an apparent heart attack while photographing the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, and two men, freelancers James Foley and Steven Sotloff, beheaded by the barbarians of the Islamic State after they were taken hostage in Syria. There were 14 inductees in all, representing the larger number (61, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists) killed last year. Associated Press reporter Kathy Gannon, her arm bandaged, spoke about AP photographer Anja Niedringhaus, gunned down in Afghanistan by a police commander who also severely wounded Gannon. The parents of Sotloff read from a note from him, smuggled home to them by a released captive. “Everyone has two lives,” he wrote. “The second one begins when you realize you only have one.” I went to the Newseum ceremony in part to mark another event occurring Monday that neither I nor any other journalist could cover: the resumption of a secret trial in Iran of The Post’s Tehran bureau chief, Jason Rezaian. Rezaian, an Iranian American guilty of nothing other than being a journalist, has been imprisoned since last summer and is being tried in Revolutionary Court on unspecified — but obviously false — charges related to espionage. Even Rezaian’s family members aren’t allowed to witness the proceedings, overseen by a judge known for imposing harsh sentences, lashings and sometimes death for political defendants. God willing, Iran will prove itself more civilized than the Islamic State and the other terrorist organizations and lawless states that have sent scores of names to the etched-glass panels of the Journalist Memorial in recent years. On the glass panels that climb a sun-filled atrium at the Newseum are the names of 2,271 journalists who have died reporting the news since 1837. Listed there is Danny Pearl, my friend and successor in the Wall Street Journal London bureau who was murdered by al-Qaeda in Pakistan in 2002. So is Anthony Shadid, who worked at The Post and later died in Syria on assignment for the New York Times. Others in the memorial I knew — David Bloom, Michael Kelly, Elizabeth Neuffer — died in Iraq, and Brad Will, my college roommate’s kid brother, was gunned down while reporting in Mexico. We’re blessed to live in a country where political disagreements are almost always resolved peacefully — and as a political reporter I’ve not had an assignment more dangerous than standing between Chuck Schumer and a microphone. I have the highest admiration for my colleagues who risk not only their lives and safety but also — more than ever — their freedom. Though killings of journalists fluctuate year by year, the number of imprisoned journalists has been rising. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports 221 were imprisoned in 2014, the second-worst year after 2012. One of them was Rezaian, whose trial is so secret that even his court-assigned lawyer isn’t allowed to say what’s happening. The only available account comes from the state’s semiofficial Tasnim news Agency. “He is being accused of being a master spy when all he was doing was reporting on a country that he loves,” his mother, Mary Breme Rezaian, told the AP at the courthouse in Tehran. Superficially, Rezaian’s circumstances have little in common with those of Anja Niedringhaus, a veteran war photojournalist who had been thrown from a car struck by a grenade in Kosovo and who was hit by a sniper’s bullet in Sarajevo and injured by shrapnel in Afghanistan before she was killed in that country last year. But I saw the similarity between Rezaian and Niedringhaus when listening to Gannon, who narrowly survived the attack that killed Niedringhaus. Selflessly, Gannon praised the sacrifices of journalists “far from conflict zones” whose reporting on crime and corruption put their homes, reputations and families at risk. “Still others are sitting in jail,” she said, “wondering what tomorrow will bring — all because they shout through their stories, photographs and videos to make us more aware and more understanding of the world.” This is the noble calling that landed so many names on glass panels at the Newseum — and Jason Rezaian in an Iranian jail.

0,"An Iranian court will hold a third hearing for a Washington Post journalist facing a closed-door trial on charges that include espionage, an Iranian report said Tuesday. The official Islamic Republic News Agency, citing a source within Iran’s judiciary, did not give a date for the next court session for Jason Rezaian, whose more than 10-month detention has drawn denunciations from press freedom groups and the State Department. Rezaian, who has dual U.S. and Iranian nationality, has strongly denied the allegations. On Monday, he offered a direct defense to the judge in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court, Iranian news agencies reported. Rezaian’s attorney, Leila Ahsan, is barred under Iranian law from revealing details about closed-door proceedings. The lack of public access to Rezaian’s trial — which began in late May — has been sharply criticized by The Post and others. The claims against Rezaian appear to include a visit he made to a U.S. Consulate seeking a visa for his Iranian wife and a letter he wrote seeking a job in the new Obama administration in 2008 — material that was apparently taken from his confiscated laptop. The 39-year-old Rezaian, the Tehran bureau chief for The Post, was taken into custody last July along with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, a correspondent for The National newspaper in Abu Dhabi. Salehi was later released on bail. A photojournalist also faces charges related to the case. Rezaian’s mother, Mary Breme Rezaian, has been in Tehran for nearly a month and has been allowed to see her son twice during brief and monitored visits, the family said. She was not allowed in the courtroom Monday.

0,"A LAWSUIT challenging Virginia’s automatic use of solitary confinement for death row inmates is on track after a federal judge refused the state’s request for dismissal. It is good this issue will get the hearing it demands. Even better would be for the state to take to heart the judge’s admonition about “changing moral and legal standards” and voluntarily end a practice that is unnecessarily punitive and of questionable efficacy. “I do not understand why the commonwealth is insisting on maintaining this level of these conditions,” District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema said in urging Virginia officials to “give some serious thought to trying to work this case out.” The suit brought by four death row inmates claims that isolation in small cells with no human contact for “nearly every hour of every day” violates the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Judge Brinkema had previously ruled automatic solitary confinement unconstitutional, but the case turned on the issue of due process and the ruling was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. Legal precedents may well be on the state’s side. But growing evidence about the harmful effects of long periods of solitary confinement and questions about its costs and usefulness should prompt state officials to rethink the practice. There is no question that safety in prisons must be a priority but, as attorneys for the inmates point out, studies have shown that inmates sentenced to death are no more dangerous than others convicted of violent crimes. A group of former corrections officers argued in another case that solitary is actually counterproductive to institutional safety. Some states — including Missouri, North Carolina and Colorado — have abandoned automatic solitary confinement for those on death row without significant problems. As for the argument that those on death row deserve no consideration, we can’t help but think of the cases of those convicts who have been exonerated but, once freed, have had to deal with the mental-health effects of solitary confinement. Federal prison officials have begun a review of confinement policies, The Post’s Matt Zapotosky has reported. Advocates for inmates argue for individual screening to determine if a prisoner poses a security risk that would require isolation. Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) should follow the lead of federal officials and order a review of a practice that will lead to more reasonable treatment of those on death row.

0,"The State Department said Thursday that Iran practices “cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment” of its citizens, part of a a harsh critique of the country’s human rights abuses that was released on the eve of a final round of negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program. The annual human rights report  was issued four months beyond the legal requirement for its publication, a deadline that is often breached but never before by so long. Critics had questioned whether the State Department was delaying the release to avoid embarrassing Iran until after the June 30 deadline for a potential deal to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the easing of sanctions. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) had proposed docking the State Department’s budget as a fine for every month of delay. The State Department has said the delay was the result of Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s heavy travel schedule. This year’s report also noted a sharp increase in abuses by non-state actors, such as the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and Boko Haram in Africa. It also described the role played by technology in both combating and committing human rights abuses, such as the imprisonment of bloggers who were tried in Saudi Arabian courts created for terrorists. A senior State Department official, speaking anonymously under rules set by the department, said it underscores the fact that government partners in the fight against non-state actors such as the Islamic State, also known as ISIL, will also be condemned for their abuses. “Going after ISIL in particular, we have to partner with a number of countries that have problematic human rights records,” the official said. “We want to be clear that this is not intended as Global War on Terror 2.0. We have learned the lessons of the past, and we want to do this in a balanced way.” Kerry said the United States was not being sanctimonious in its criticism of other countries. “We couldn’t help but have humility when we have seen what we have seen in the last year in terms of racial discord and unrest,” he said. “So we approach this with great self-awareness.” He noted that some of the countries cited in the report were allies and advised their leaders to read the report. “No country can fulfill its potential if its people are held back, or more so, if they are beaten down by repression,” he said. Every year, the report offers a hard judgment of Iran’s human rights record, and this one was no exception. Because Washington does not have an embassy in Tehran, it drew on reports by the United Nations that at least 895 political prisoners are incarcerated in Iran. Among them were at least 30 journalists, the report said. It did not specifically mention Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter who has been detained in Iran for more than 11 months and who is being tried for espionage and other related charges. But it did say one of the journalists arrested in 2014 was his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who was later released on bail. The report singled out Iran’s Evin Prison, “notorious for cruel and prolonged torture for political opponents of the government,” where it said the government used “white torture,” including extreme sensory deprivation and isolation. It said Iran executed 721 people last year, many without due process. That was far more than the 268 executions Iran announced. The State Department also cited reports that the government was responsible for arbitrary and unlawful killings. Globally, the report said 2014 will be remembered for atrocities committed by a number of extremist groups. “For far too many people, 2014 was defined by suffering and abuse perpetrated by terrorist groups exploiting religious discourse and divisions to advance their totalitarian ideology, or by governments, such as Syria, sometimes acting in the name of combating terrorism,” Kerry said in the introduction.","The State Department said Thursday that Iran practices “cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment” of its citizens, part of a a harsh critique of the country’s human rights abuses that was released on the eve of a final round of negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program.

0,"Jason Lifton and Jenna Steinberger made a lasting connection in January 2013 while waiting for their luggage at Reagan National Airport’s baggage claim. Jason first noticed Jenna and her younger sister, Jess, back in Palm Beach, Fla., at the gate waiting to board the same U.S. Airways flight. They had all spent the winter holidays with their families at vacation homes in southern Florida and were headed back to Washington. He recalls thinking: “Two cute girls on the plane, yes! I hope I can sit next to one of them.” Instead, to his disappointment, he was seated in a faraway section next to a not-as-cute neighbor. After the flight, Jason noticed the pair again at baggage claim. Realizing this would probably be his last chance to strike up a conversation, he walked over and asked whether they knew at which baggage carousel their luggage would be arriving. “No idea,” Jenna cheerfully replied. She noticed that the friendly, outgoing stranger was wearing a George Washington University sweatshirt. Her interest was piqued; she was a GWU doctoral graduate and physical therapist at GWU Hospital. She queried him and learned he also was a graduate and then-chief of staff to one of the university’s associate provosts. When their bags arrived, the two were still rapt in conversation, discussing work, family and friends. “He was really cute and really dorky. I liked it,” Jenna says. “They say you should never talk to strangers, but this time it paid off,” quips Jason, a development analyst for Urban Investment Partners in Washington. Jenna was hoping he would ask for her number. Although he was interested, given their short visit, he simply parted with “I’ll see you around at the Whole Foods!” “I have no game, clearly,” he says now with a laugh. That night, they both Googled each other. Jason was unsuccessful, but Jenna found him on Facebook. When she saw that his main photo featured another girl (who she would later learn was his sister), she decided to let it go. But Jason was still determined. The next day, over dinner with a friend, he lamented the fact that he hadn’t asked for Jenna’s number. “I met this really cute Jewish doctor at baggage claim, but I didn’t even get her number,” he said. Turns out, his friend was headed to a physical therapy appointment at GWU the next morning and offered to track Jenna down. Sure enough, his friend’s physical therapist was a colleague of Jenna’s. As Jenna recalls, “She called me in the middle of the day and said, ‘Did you meet a guy at the airport yesterday?’ I stopped dead in my tracks and turned bright red. All my colleagues were staring at me.” She passed along her number, and Jason called the next day. For their first date a week later, they planned to squeeze in drinks at Lincoln restaurant in downtown Washington before Jason had to meet friends at a GWU basketball game. The date went so well that he skipped the game and the two talked for nearly five hours. “I had a gut feeling that this was going to work on our first date,” Jenna says. “It was just really fun and comfortable. We were so compatible.” Two weeks later, on their third date, Jason felt a similar instinct. He offered to cook Jenna chicken Parmesan at his home in Foggy Bottom. Everything was going well until he opened an expired can of pasta sauce, which exploded and left Jenna covered head to toe in sauce. “When she laughed about it and didn’t flip out, I thought, ‘This is a good sign. . . . This [one] may be a keeper,” Jason says. A relationship quickly developed over the next several weeks, and the two moved in together in December. It didn’t take long before they were discussing marriage. In August 2014, on a beach trip to Margate, N.J., Jason surprised Jenna with a proposal at the Margate Dairy Bar Ice Cream Shop. “Ice cream, the beach and diamonds [are] three of Jenna’s favorite things,” he says. “So I figured the chances of her saying yes with those things present would be pretty good.” Jason’s mom had sneaked over to the parlor early and tipped them off to her son’s plan. She requested that they make whatever dessert Jenna ordered massive. “Her ice cream sundae was at least two feet tall,” Jason says, laughing. Distracted by her Hulk-size treat, she didn’t notice that Jason had tiptoed behind her and dropped to a knee. He tapped her on the back, she turned around and he asked: “Would you be interested in more than just some ice cream?” She was. Jenna Steinberger, 30, and Jason Lifton, 26, exchanged vows May 30 before 250 friends and family members at the St. Clair Country Club in Upper St. Clair, Pa. “I got very caught up in the ceremony,” Jason recalls. “When the cantor said, ‘Do you, Jason . . .’ I jumped in [early] and said, ‘I do!’ ” At the reception, guests dined on a breakfast buffet and, instead of wedding cake, burnt-almond torte and mini milkshakes. The couple spent their honeymoon in French Polynesia and, upon their return, made sure to snap a photo at National Airport’s baggage claim — “where it all began,” Jason says. “I love telling people the story of how we first met,” Jenna said after the wedding. “I’ve always wished my life was like a romantic movie or a musical, and now I feel like it is.”  Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Jenna’s sister, Jess, as her older sister. She is her younger sister. The story also incorrectly stated that Jason interrupted a rabbi during his vows. It was a cantor.

0,"VIENNA — Negotiators are on the threshold of finalizing a historic nuclear deal with Iran, diplomats said Sunday as they tried to reach consensus on a few outstanding issues that have caused the talks to drag on past one deadline after another. Diplomats from several of the six countries negotiating with Iran said they could announce a deal as early as Monday. They cautioned that last-minute obstacles could get in the way, though virtually everyone involved has been showing signs of fatigue. But political figures in the Middle East, Europe and Washington appeared to be preparing for an agreement that would restrict Iran’s nuclear program for more than a decade, lift international sanctions that have battered its economy and potentially alter the way Iran interacts with the rest of the world. In the most telling indication that a comprehensive agreement was at hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived late Sunday. He joined U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who have been mainstays of the negotiations. The senior diplomats from France, Germany and Britain have been here off and on for a week. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was reported preparing to come, too. “We have come a long way,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in Tehran. “We need to reach a peak, and we’re very close.” As negotiators moved into the apparent end game of their talks, Ali Rezaian released a statement Sunday saying that the trial of his brother, Washington Post Tehran bureau chief Jason Rezaian, who has been held in Iran for nearly a year and is charged with crimes including espionage, is scheduled to resume Monday. It will be the third session before Iran’s Revolutionary Court since he was detained. Meanwhile, as diplomats gathered in the Austrian capital, where the latest round of talks kicked off June 26, some final disagreements stood in the way of a 100-page draft agreement being sent to the capitals for approval. Zarif, taking a break at sunset on the third-floor balcony of the Coburg Palace, the hotel where the talks were conducted, said more work was needed, and he held up a sheaf of white papers that he was reading through. The State Department tamped down speculation that a deal was ready Sunday. “We have never speculated about the timing of anything during these negotiations, and we’re certainly not going to start now — especially given the fact that major issues remain to be resolved in these talks,” said a senior State Department official, speaking anonymously under ground rules for talking to reporters. There were other, smaller tells that most of the dickering is at the negotiators’ backs. Kerry, who on Saturday attended back-to-back meetings that stretched over 15 hours and lasted past midnight, left his hotel late Sunday morning to attend Mass at St. Stephen’s Cathedral. And afterward, instead of rushing to meetings, he strolled through the historic center of Vienna like a typical tourist, stopping to visit a house where Mozart once lived. “I think we’re getting to some real decisions,” Kerry said before entering his limousine. “So I will say, because we have a few tough things to do, I remain hopeful. Hopeful.” French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said an end to a year and a half of intense negotiations was at hand. “I hope that we are finally entering the last phase of this negotiation,” he told reporters outside the Coburg Palace. Some of the delay is bureaucratic — reading through a draft, getting it approved at home and coordinating rollout announcements. “Even if an agreement is finalized, it will take hours to check and clean up all the paperwork,” an Iranian official said Sunday afternoon. “It only requires political will at this point.” Sunday marked the 16th straight day of high-level talks that began with the expectation that an agreement could be reached by the deadline of June 30, or shortly after. The talks have been extended three times since then, most recently until midnight Monday. Reports from Tehran said business had virtually ground to a halt as people waited for word of the outcome. The city’s police chief announced that his force was ready to provide security for celebrating Iranians. And the speaker of Iran’s parliament, Ali Larijani, said that a comprehensive agreement deal was likely. Some of the anticipation was more wary than gleeful. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized what he called a “parade of concessions” to Iran that he contrasted to vitriolic statements against the United States and Israel emanating from Tehran. On Saturday, for example, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the United States the “embodiment of global arrogance” — even though Khamenei has given his blessing to the negotiations. “Iran does not hide its intention to continue its murderous aggression even against those with whom it is negotiating,” Netanyahu said in his weekly cabinet meeting. “Perhaps there is someone among the great powers who is prepared to capitulate to this reality that Iran is dictating, which includes its unending calls for the destruction of Israel. We will not pay the price for this.” On CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, expressed doubts about Kerry’s negotiating skills with Iran and said, “I’m concerned about where we’re going.” “You know, likely, Iran will cheat by inches, meaning they will just cheat, cheat, cheat,” he said. “And over time, it’s like boiling an egg. They end up with a nuclear weapon.” Corker was instrumental in compromise legislation under which Congress will get 60 days to review any deal and ultimately vote to approve or reject it. It would need 67 votes to withstand a presidential veto, however. Critics of the deal could marshal support if the final text of an agreement shows the United States and its negotiating partners had agreed to lift a U.N. embargo on conventional weapons trade — as Iran has insisted and Russia has publicly supported. The United States opposes it in part because Washington is concerned that the arms could end up helping Iran expand its regional influence by backing Syrian President Bashar Assad and groups such as the Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (Md), the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, who worked with Corker on the review legislation, seemed to suggest that Democrats may turn a wary eye on the deal. “There is no trust when it comes to Iran,” he said in a statement. “In our deliberations we need to ensure the negotiations resulted in a comprehensive, long-lasting and verifiable outcome that also provides for snap-back of sanctions should Iran deviate from its commitments.” Ruth Eglash in Jerusalem contributed to this report.","VIENNA — Negotiators are on the threshold of finalizing a historic nuclear deal with Iran, diplomats said Sunday as they tried to reach consensus on a few outstanding issues that have caused the talks to drag on past one deadline after another.

And afterward, instead of rushing to meetings, he strolled through the historic center of Vienna like a typical tourist, stopping to visit a house where Mozart once lived. “I think we’re getting to some real decisions,” Kerry said before entering his limousine. “So I will say, because we have a few tough things to do, I remain hopeful. Hopeful.” French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said an end to a year and a half of intense negotiations was at hand. “I hope that we are finally entering the last phase of this negotiation,” he told reporters outside the Coburg Palace. Some of the delay is bureaucratic — reading through a draft, getting it approved at home and coordinating rollout announcements. “Even if an agreement is finalized, it will take hours to check and clean up all the paperwork,” an Iranian official said Sunday afternoon. “It only requires political will at this point.” Sunday marked the 16th straight day of high-level talks that began with the expectation that an agreement could be reached by the deadline of June 30, or shortly after. The talks have been extended three times since then, most recently until midnight Monday. Reports from Tehran said business had virtually ground to a halt as people waited for word of the outcome. The city’s police chief announced that his force was ready to provide security for celebrating Iranians. And the speaker of Iran’s parliament, Ali Larijani, said that a comprehensive agreement deal was likely. Some of the anticipation was more wary than gleeful. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized what he called a “parade of concessions” to Iran that he contrasted to vitriolic statements against the United States and Israel emanating from Tehran. On Saturday, for example, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the United States the “embodiment of global arrogance” — even though Khamenei has given his blessing to the negotiations. “Iran does not hide its intention to continue its murderous aggression even against those with whom it is negotiating,” Netanyahu said in his weekly cabinet meeting. “Perhaps there is someone among the great powers who is prepared to capitulate to this reality that Iran is dictating, which includes its unending calls for the destruction of Israel. We will not pay the price for this.” On CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, expressed doubts about Kerry’s negotiating skills with Iran and said, “I’m concerned about where we’re going.” “You know, likely, Iran will cheat by inches, meaning they will just cheat, cheat, cheat,” he said. “And over time, it’s like boiling an egg. They end up with a nuclear weapon.” Corker was instrumental in compromise legislation under which Congress will get 60 days to review any deal and ultimately vote to approve or reject it. It would need 67 votes to withstand a presidential veto, however. Critics of the deal could marshal support if the final text of an agreement shows the United States and its negotiating partners had agreed to lift a U.N. embargo on conventional weapons trade — as Iran has insisted and Russia has publicly supported. The United States opposes it in part because Washington is concerned that the arms could end up helping Iran expand its regional influence by backing Syrian President Bashar Assad and groups such as the Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (Md), the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, who worked with Corker on the review legislation, seemed to suggest that Democrats may turn a wary eye on the deal. “There is no trust when it comes to Iran,” he said in a statement. “In our deliberations we need to ensure the negotiations resulted in a comprehensive, long-lasting and verifiable outcome that also provides for snap-back of sanctions should Iran deviate from its commitments.” Ruth Eglash in Jerusalem contributed to this report."
0,"An Iranian court on Monday held a third hearing for a Washington Post journalist facing charges, including espionage, in a trial that has drawn sharp criticism from press freedom groups and the State Department. The attorney for Jason Rezaian, The Post’s bureau chief in Tehran, said the charges were reviewed during the closed-door session in the Revolutionary Court. But the lawyer, Leila Ahsan, could give no further details about the session. She is barred from publicly discussing the proceedings against Rezaian, who has been detained for nearly a year. “Jason was in good spirits and answered some questions about the charges,” Ahsan was quoted as saying by Rezaian’s family. No date has been set for a possible next hearing. “Jason Rezaian’s unjust detention on espionage and other charges trumped up by Iranian authorities has now, almost inconceivably, stretched into nearly a full year,” said The Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron. Baron called on Iranian authorities to “deliver a speedy, fair and impartial judgment in Jason’s case — one that could only result in his acquittal, immediate release and a long-overdue reunion with his family.” “It is long past time to bring an end to the nightmare,” he added. Top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State John F. Kerry, have raised concerns about Iran’s detention of Rezaian and several other Americans. But the issues have remained separate from ongoing talks seeking to limit Tehran’s nuclear program. A statement from Rezaian’s brother, Ali, repeated the family’s insistence that Rezaian — a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen — worked in Iran only as a journalist. “There is no evidence that Jason created or spread any propaganda against Iran,” and he never had access to sensitive documents or sites, including those involved in Iran’s nuclear program, Ali Rezaian said. “Jason’s continued detention is as baseless as it is cruel and unjust,” the statement said. “We ask the Iranian judiciary to put an end to the delays in his trial, release Jason and allow him to reunite with his family.” The Revolutionary Court held two sessions in Rezaian’s trial in May and June. The charges against him include espionage and distributing propaganda against the Islamic republic. Rezaian, his Iranian wife and two photojournalists were detained July 22, 2014, in Tehran. His wife, Yeganeh Salehi, a correspondent for the National newspaper in Abu Dhabi, was later released on bail. One of the photojournalists also faces charges related to the case. The claims against Rezaian, 39, appear to include a visit he made to a U.S. consulate seeking a visa for his wife and a letter he wrote seeking a job in the Obama administration in 2008 — material that was apparently taken from his confiscated laptop. Rezaian’s mother, Mary Breme Rezaian, and his wife have been at the court for each hearing, but they have not been allowed to attend the sessions. On Monday, his mother made a direct appeal to judicial authorities to release her son on bail under a new legal code that she says sets a maximum limit for detention at one year for those awaiting trial or facing ongoing proceedings. “This law is intended to protect Iranian citizens. Since Iran is making charges against Jason based on his Iranian citizenship, then this law must also apply to him,” she told The Post. “We demand his immediate release on bail so he can be reunited with his family.” Read more: Marking off the days of Rezaian’s detention Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world","An Iranian court on Monday held a third hearing for a Washington Post journalist facing charges, including espionage, in a trial that has drawn sharp criticism from press freedom groups and the State Department.

0,"JUST AS negotiators were completing an agreement on Iran’s nuclear program on Monday, Post reporter Jason Rezaian was summoned to a Tehran court for another session of his secret, irregular and blatantly political trial. We find it hard to believe this was a coincidence. Mr. Rezaian, a 39-year-old California native who was arrested just under a year ago, has been cruelly forced into an auxiliary role in the long negotiations between Tehran and a U.S.-led coalition — a pawn used by hard-liners to undermine goodwill, or perhaps to demonstrate that any accord Iran strikes with the West will not alter its repressive domestic regime or its anti-Western policies. The ordeal has inflicted untold physical and psychological suffering on a journalist who moved to Iran with the ambition of improving Americans’ understanding of its people and culture. Enough. Now that the nuclear deal is completed, it is past time for Iranian authorities to release Mr. Rezaian, along with two and possibly three other Americans imprisoned in the country, including pastor Saeed Abedini and retired U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati. President Obama and Secretary of State John F. Kerry have spoken hopefully of charting a new course in relations between the countries. If that is to happen, the release of the prisoners must be the first step. Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister who also has hinted at a new era of cooperation, ought to understand this imperative. He has called Mr. Rezaian a “friend” and “a good reporter”; he is clearly aware that there is no basis for the espionage charges brought against him. During the negotiations, Mr. Zarif dodged questions about the Post reporter and at one point even suggested, absurdly, that he might have been duped into wrongdoing. Now he and President Hassan Rouhani should be obliged to put a stop to a travesty that is showing them to be powerless to control the domestic hard-liners who seek to sabotage the nuclear agreement. An opportunity for clemency is imminent. According to Mr. Rezaian’s mother, Mary Breme Rezaian, her son should soon be eligible for release on bail. A law sets a detention limit of one year for Iranian detainees whose trials have not been completed. Mr. Rezaian is regarded by Iran as a citizen, so the provision should apply to him. He was taken from his home on July 22 along with his Iranian wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who is also on trial but has been released on bail. Though U.S. officials have raised Mr. Rezaian’s case and Mr. Obama publicly called for his release, his case and those of the other Americans were not part of the nuclear negotiation. While that may have been appropriate, Mr. Rezaian’s release should be a condition for any further improvement in relations.

0,"An Iranian court could be nearing the end of its trial of a detained Washington Post journalist on charges that include espionage, his lawyer said Monday, amid increasing calls for his release after nearly a year in custody. The international media freedom group, the Committee to Protect Journalists, joined The Post’s executive editor in separate demands to end Jason Rezaian’s detention and halt the prosecution. Rezaian, The Post’s Tehran correspondent, will mark one year in custody Wednesday as he faces a closed-door trial in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court on allegations that include spying-related claims — charges he has strongly denied. The 39-year-old Rezaian, who holds dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, had his third hearing before the court last week. The next session has not been scheduled, but his lawyer, Leila Ahsan, said court officials told her it will “almost certainly” be the last. “Still, it’s not clear how long it will take for the court to issue a verdict on the case after the last session,” Ahsan told the Associated Press in Tehran. She declined to comment further and is barred from publicly discussing details of the proceedings. Rezaian could face between 10 and 20 years in prison if convicted. “It is long past time for the Iranian authorities to bring this process to an end,” Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, said in a statement. “There can be no reason for further delay.” Baron called the Iranian charges “grave” but said they “could not be more ludicrous.” “Any fair outcome would clear Jason of these manufactured charges so that he can be released and reunited with his family,” Baron said. In a separate letter, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists appealed to the head of Iran’s judiciary, Sadegh Larijani, to intervene to ensure that the case “is resolved immediately and that Jason returns to his family.” “Never before has an international journalist been held for so long in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” said the letter, sent on behalf of the group’s board of directors. “Our colleague has been denied any real opportunity to defend himself against the charges.” Top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State John F. Kerry, have raised concerns about Iran’s detention of Rezaian and several other Americans.

1,"President Obama vowed Tuesday that his administration is “not going to relent” until Iran releases three Americans held in custody, including a Washington Post journalist reaching the one-year mark of his detention. Obama also demanded clear information from Tehran to assist in finding the whereabouts of a former FBI agent and CIA contractor last seen in Iran. The comments echo previous statements by Obama and other top U.S. officials pressing for the release of the detained Americans. But Obama and his allies now face added backlash from critics who complain last week’s accord to limit Iran’s nuclear program did not include specific demands to free the Americans. “We are not going to relent until we bring home our Americans who are unjustly detained in Iran,” Obama said in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Pittsburgh. Obama listed by name each of the Americans. “Journalist Jason Rezaian should be released. Pastor Saeed Abedini should be released. Amir Hekmati, a former sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps, should be released,” Obama said. “Iran needs to help us find Robert Levinson.” Rezaian, the Post’s Tehran correspondent, marks a year in custody on Wednesday.

The statement joined separate demands from the Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, for Rezaian’s immediate release and dismissal of charges Baron described as “ludicrous.” Abedini, a Christian pastor who has been in Iranian custody since September 2012, was convicted of security-related charges that include claims of proselytizing. Hekmati, held since 2011, was convicted in early 2012 for espionage and other charges. An original death sentence was later reduced to 10 years in prison, according to the family’s Web site. All three are of Iranian ancestry. Levinson was last seen publicly in March 2007 on the Iranian resort island Kish, where he was investigating cigarette smuggling on behalf of a client.

0,"On July 22, 2014, Iranian authorities crashed into the Tehran home of Washington Post Iran correspondent Jason Rezaian and arrested him and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, also a journalist. Rezaian was taken to Iran’s infamous Evin Prison, where he was put in solitary confinement for months, without a word of explanation to his family or to the outside world. Salehi, an Iranian citizen, was released on bail last fall. Iran released Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, according to U.S. officials. Along with Rezaian, three other detained Americans are being released in a swap for seven people imprisoned or charged by the United States. Rezaian’s incarceration was the longest, by far, for a Western journalist in Iran since the 1979 revolution that brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power. Throughout his captivity, the 39-year-old California native has been subjected to grueling interrogations and repeated deprivations, forced to stay for weeks in a bare cell without a mattress or even a toilet, family members said after they were allowed to speak with him. Rezaian has been periodically deprived of medicine for his high blood pressure, family members said, and his physical condition has deteriorated, with dramatic weight loss, back pain and chronic eye and groin infections. Top U.S. officials, including President Obama and Secretary of State John F. Kerry, have repeatedly demanded Rezaian’s release, echoing similar calls by other Western governments, human rights groups and Washington Post leadership, which has asserted the correspondent’s innocence. July 25, 2014  :  Iran confirms that Rezaian has been detained. July 29, 2014: Wendy Sherman, undersecretary of state for political affairs, tells the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States formally called for the immediate release of Rezaian, his wife and two other U.S. citizens detained the same night.  Aug. 6, 2014 :  Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Hassan Ghashghavi, says the detention is “an internal matter” and says the country does not acknowledge Rezaian’s U.S. citizenship.  Aug. 20, 2014: A photojournalist who worked with Rezaian and Salehi and also was detained is released on bail.   Sept. 17, 2014:  In an interview with NPR, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says Rezaian is “facing interrogation in Iran for what he has done as an Iranian citizen” but declines to name any crime. He says Iran’s judiciary “has no obligation to explain to the United States why it is detaining one of [Iran’s own] citizens.” Douglas Jehl, The Post’s foreign editor, responds in a statement that Rezaian and his wife are “fully accredited journalists, and we remain mystified by their detention and deeply concerned about their welfare.” Ali Rezaian, Jason’s older brother, says in a statement: “Neither I nor my mother have been permitted any communication with Jason. We remain concerned about their health and implore the Iranian authorities to release them in compliance with Iran’s existing laws and constitution.”  Oct. 5, 2014: Ali Rezaian says Salehi was released on bail during the previous week and was permitted one visit with her husband.  Dec. 6, 2014: After nearly five months of detention, Rezaian is charged after a 10-hour court proceeding that is closed to the public. He is denied legal representation and is accompanied by a government-appointed Farsi translator. He is denied bail.  Dec. 11, 2014: Mary Rezaian appears on video and pleads for her son’s release.   Jan. 14, 2015:  Jason Rezaian’s case is transferred to a branch of the Revolutionary Court, which is closely aligned with Iranian intelligence services.  Feb. 1, 2015: Judge Abolghassem Salavati is picked to preside over the trial, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. He is one of six judges who are leading a crackdown on journalists and political activists in Iran, according to human rights groups. He formally charges Rezaian, then prohibits his chosen attorney from representing him.  Feb. 8, 2015: At a Munich Security Conference session, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius asks Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, about Rezaian. “I hope that he will be cleared of the charges in a court of law,” Zarif answers, “and that will be a good day for me.”  Feb. 12, 2015: Ali Rezaian says that Iranian prison authorities have let his brother leave jail briefly to get medical treatment and have permitted his wife to visit and bring books, food and warmer clothes.  March 12, 2015: Boxing legend Muhammad Ali calls for Jason’s release: “During his time as the Washington Post bureau chief in Tehran, Jason used his gift of writing and intimate knowledge of the country to share the stories of the people and culture of Iran to the world. To my knowledge, Jason is a man of peace and great faith, a man whose dedication and respect for the Iranian people is evident in his work.”  April 20, 2015: Leila Ahsan, Rezaian’s new attorney, holds her first substantive meeting with him and releases a statement in Farsi “based on the indictment” that indicates he is being charged with four crimes: espionage, collaborating with hostile governments, collecting and distributing information about foreign policies “with malicious intent” and “conducting propaganda against the establishment.” Each carries a maximum prison term of 10 to 20 years.   April 25, 2015:  Obama, in remarks at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner in Washington, notes that journalists have been murdered “for nothing more than trying to shine a light into some of the world’s darkest corners.” He added: “We remember the journalists unjustly imprisoned around the world, including our own Jason Rezaian. For nine months, Jason has been imprisoned in Tehran for nothing more than writing about the hopes and the fears of the Iranian people, carrying their stories to the readers of The Washington Post in an effort to bridge our common humanity. As was already mentioned, Jason’s brother, Ali, is here tonight, and I have told him personally we will not rest until we bring him home to his family, safe and sound.”   April 29, 2015  :  Foreign Minister Zarif, in an interview with Ignatius at New York University, refers to Jason Rezaian as “my friend” and reiterates his hope that the journalist will be “cleared in a court. But he will have to face a court. He is an Iranian citizen.”  May 11, 2015: The Senate unanimously passes a resolution calling on Iran to release Rezaian and other Americans believed to be detained and calling on Obama to “undertake every effort using every diplomatic tool” at his disposal to gain their release.   May 26, 2015:  Rezaian’s trial begins and is adjourned after one day. His wife and mother are not permitted to attend the hearing, held outside of public view.  June 8, 2015: A second closed-door hearing ends after three hours. No details are released, including whether Rezaian’s attorney was able to present evidence or cross-examine government witnesses.

Post Executive Editor Martin Baron calls on authorities to “deliver a speedy, fair and impartial judgment in Jason’s case — one that could only result in his acquittal, immediate release and a long-overdue reunion with his family.”  July 14, 2015: After a marathon 17 days of talks, the United States and negotiating partners from Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union reach a historic agreement with Iran to limit the country’s nuclear program.  July 17, 2015: Speaking on MSNBC, Secretary of State John F. Kerry says: “There was not a meeting that took place, not one meeting that took place — believe me, that’s not an exaggeration — where we did not raise the issue of our American citizens being held. And in fact, it was the last conversation that I had with the foreign minister at the Vienna Center, right before we went out publicly. I talked to him the last time about that.”  July 20, 2015: Ahsan tells the Associated Press that Revolutionary Court officials have told her that Rezaian’s next court session, as yet unscheduled, will “almost certainly” be the last. “Still, it’s not clear how long it will take for the court to issue a verdict on the case after the last session.”  July 20, 2015: The U.N.

Iran needs to help us find Robert Levinson.”  July 22, 2015: As Rezaian enters his second year of custody in Evin Prison, The Post petitions the United Nations for “urgent action” to help secure his release. The petition accuses the Iranian government of “flagrant violations of international law” during a year of “arbitrary and unlawful” detention.    
(Michael Cavna/Washington Post)  AUG. 10, 2015: An Iranian court holds its final hearing in Rezaian’s trial but does not give a clear indication on when a verdict will be reached.  AUG. 14, 2015: U.N. human rights experts issue statements calling for the release of Rezaian. “The arrest, detention and secret trial of Mr. Rezaian violate his rights and intimidate all those working in the media in Iran,” said David Kaye, the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression.  OCT. 9, 2015: This marks the 444th day of Rezaiain’s improsonment in Iran. He will now “have been held for the same amount of time as U.S. government employees during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1981.”  OCT. 12, 2015: Iranian state television reported that Rezaian has been convicted. No other details were available.  NOV. 25, 2015: The Washington Post further expands efforts for Rezaian’s release and files supplementary petition with the U.N Working Group on Arbitrary Detention calling for the Post reporter’s immediate release.  DEC. 3, 2015: This marks 500 days since Rezaian’s arrest.  Jan. 16, 2016: Iran announces the release of Post correspondent Jason Rezaian through an exchange deal with the United States. The other detained Americans released by Iran, according to Iranian media, included Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati. Hekmati is a U.S. Marine veteran and Arizona native with dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship. He was serving a 10-year sentence after his conviction in a closed trial on charges of “cooperating with hostile governments.” Abedini, an Iranian-born Christian pastor who lived in Idaho, was also released. He was imprisoned since 2012, allegedly for seeking to start churches in private homes. A fourth person named Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari was also released, though his detention was not previously publicized. Less is known about the fate of Robert Levinson, a retired FBI agent who was last seen on Iran’s Kish Island in 2007 after traveling to the country on a CIA contract. An unidentified group released a video of Levinson in an orange prison jumpsuit in 2011, but Iranian officials have repeatedly denied any knowledge of his whereabouts.

Rezaian was taken to Iran’s infamous Evin Prison, where he was put in solitary confinement for months, without a word of explanation to his family or to the outside world. Salehi, an Iranian citizen, was released on bail last fall. Iran released Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, according to U.S. officials. Along with Rezaian, three other detained Americans are being released in a swap for seven people imprisoned or charged by the United States. Rezaian’s incarceration was the longest, by far, for a Western journalist in Iran since the 1979 revolution that brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power. Throughout his captivity, the 39-year-old California native has been subjected to grueling interrogations and repeated deprivations, forced to stay for weeks in a bare cell without a mattress or even a toilet, family members said after they were allowed to speak with him. Rezaian has been periodically deprived of medicine for his high blood pressure, family members said, and his physical condition has deteriorated, with dramatic weight loss, back pain and chronic eye and groin infections. Top U.S. officials, including President Obama and Secretary of State John F. Kerry, have repeatedly demanded Rezaian’s release, echoing similar calls by other Western governments, human rights groups and Washington Post leadership, which has asserted the correspondent’s innocence. July 25, 2014  :  Iran confirms that Rezaian has been detained. July 29, 2014: Wendy Sherman, undersecretary of state for political affairs, tells the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States formally called for the immediate release of Rezaian, his wife and two other U.S. citizens detained the same night.  Aug. 6, 2014 :  Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Hassan Ghashghavi, says the detention is “an internal matter” and says the country does not acknowledge Rezaian’s U.S. citizenship.  Aug. 20, 2014: A photojournalist who worked with Rezaian and Salehi and also was detained is released on bail.   Sept. 17, 2014:  In an interview with NPR, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says Rezaian is “facing interrogation in Iran for what he has done as an Iranian citizen” but declines to name any crime. He says Iran’s judiciary “has no obligation to explain to the United States why it is detaining one of [Iran’s own] citizens.” Douglas Jehl, The Post’s foreign editor, responds in a statement that Rezaian and his wife are “fully accredited journalists, and we remain mystified by their detention and deeply concerned about their welfare.” Ali Rezaian, Jason’s older brother, says in a statement: “Neither I nor my mother have been permitted any communication with Jason. We remain concerned about their health and implore the Iranian authorities to release them in compliance with Iran’s existing laws and constitution.”  Oct. 5, 2014: Ali Rezaian says Salehi was released on bail during the previous week and was permitted one visit with her husband.  Dec. 6, 2014: After nearly five months of detention, Rezaian is charged after a 10-hour court proceeding that is closed to the public. He is denied legal representation and is accompanied by a government-appointed Farsi translator. He is denied bail.  Dec. 11, 2014: Mary Rezaian appears on video and pleads for her son’s release.   Jan. 14, 2015:  Jason Rezaian’s case is transferred to a branch of the Revolutionary Court, which is closely aligned with Iranian intelligence services.  Feb. 1, 2015: Judge Abolghassem Salavati is picked to preside over the trial, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. He is one of six judges who are leading a crackdown on journalists and political activists in Iran, according to human rights groups. He formally charges Rezaian, then prohibits his chosen attorney from representing him.  Feb. 8, 2015: At a Munich Security Conference session, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius asks Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, about Rezaian. “I hope that he will be cleared of the charges in a court of law,” Zarif answers, “and that will be a good day for me.”  Feb. 12, 2015: Ali Rezaian says that Iranian prison authorities have let his brother leave jail briefly to get medical treatment and have permitted his wife to visit and bring books, food and warmer clothes.  March 12, 2015: Boxing legend Muhammad Ali calls for Jason’s release: “During his time as the Washington Post bureau chief in Tehran, Jason used his gift of writing and intimate knowledge of the country to share the stories of the people and culture of Iran to the world. To my knowledge, Jason is a man of peace and great faith, a man whose dedication and respect for the Iranian people is evident in his work.”  April 20, 2015: Leila Ahsan, Rezaian’s new attorney, holds her first substantive meeting with him and releases a statement in Farsi “based on the indictment” that indicates he is being charged with four crimes: espionage, collaborating with hostile governments, collecting and distributing information about foreign policies “with malicious intent” and “conducting propaganda against the establishment.” Each carries a maximum prison term of 10 to 20 years.   April 25, 2015:  Obama, in remarks at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner in Washington, notes that journalists have been murdered “for nothing more than trying to shine a light into some of the world’s darkest corners.” He added: “We remember the journalists unjustly imprisoned around the world, including our own Jason Rezaian. For nine months, Jason has been imprisoned in Tehran for nothing more than writing about the hopes and the fears of the Iranian people, carrying their stories to the readers of The Washington Post in an effort to bridge our common humanity. As was already mentioned, Jason’s brother, Ali, is here tonight, and I have told him personally we will not rest until we bring him home to his family, safe and sound.”   April 29, 2015  :  Foreign Minister Zarif, in an interview with Ignatius at New York University, refers to Jason Rezaian as “my friend” and reiterates his hope that the journalist will be “cleared in a court. But he will have to face a court. He is an Iranian citizen.”  May 11, 2015: The Senate unanimously passes a resolution calling on Iran to release Rezaian and other Americans believed to be detained and calling on Obama to “undertake every effort using every diplomatic tool” at his disposal to gain their release.   May 26, 2015:  Rezaian’s trial begins and is adjourned after one day. His wife and mother are not permitted to attend the hearing, held outside of public view.  June 8, 2015: A second closed-door hearing ends after three hours. No details are released, including whether Rezaian’s attorney was able to present evidence or cross-examine government witnesses.   July 13, 2015:  A third closed-door hearing takes place. Ahsan, Rezaian’s attorney, is barred from publicly discussing the proceedings and is unable to report what occurred. Post Executive Editor Martin Baron calls on authorities to “deliver a speedy, fair and impartial judgment in Jason’s case — one that could only result in his acquittal, immediate release and a long-overdue reunion with his family.”  July 14, 2015: After a marathon 17 days of talks, the United States and negotiating partners from Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union reach a historic agreement with Iran to limit the country’s nuclear program.

1,"The ordeal started with a crash through the door as Iranian police stormed reporter Jason Rezaian’s house late at night. Within hours, The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent landed in a small cell where he was kept for weeks in isolation, denied a mattress, medicine or access to a bathroom. In the months that followed, he was subjected to a catalogue of physical mistreatment and psychological abuse while being refused basic legal rights — an “arbitrary and unlawful” confinement that violates Iran’s own constitution, lawyers for The Post said in papers they released Wednesday. The news organization provided new details of Rezaian’s treatment as it appealed formally to the United Nations for help in pressuring Iran’s government to release the 39-year-old American citizen, who on Wednesday began a second year of incarceration. A petition filed with the U.N. Human Rights Council decried the handling of Rezaian’s case by an Iranian judiciary system that one company official called “a poster child for bad behavior.” “Every aspect of his case — his incarceration, his trial, the conditions of his imprisonment — has been a disgraceful violation of human rights and a violation of common decency,” Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said, announcing the action at a news conference at Washington’s National Press Club. The Post raised the volume in its year-long protest over Rezaian’s imprisonment with its request for an expedited inquiry by the U.N. council’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, an independent body that investigates alleged human rights abuses. While company officials had hoped that Rezaian might be freed after last week’s conclusion of nuclear talks with Iran, the nuclear deal “sadly provided no resolution to the case,” Baron said. Rezaian, a California native and an Iranian immigrant’s son with dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, is being held in Iran’s notorious Evin Prison. His year-long incarceration is the longest for any Western journalist held by the Islamic republic since the 1979 revolution. The filing of the 40-page U.N. petition comes in a week when Iranian officials suggested that the trial phase of his incarceration was nearing an end. On Wednesday, a Iranian deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, acknowledged discussing Rezaian’s case with U.S. officials “as a humanitarian issue” on the sidelines of the recent nuclear talks. Araghchi made the comment unprompted at a Tehran news conference, the Associated Press reported. President Obama on Tuesday repeated a vow to win Rezaian’s release, telling U.S. war veterans in a speech that the United States is “not going to relent until we bring home our Americans who are unjustly detained in Iran.” U.S. officials are also seeking the release of two other detained Americans — Marine veteran Amir Hekmati and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini — as well as Iran’s cooperation in investigating the disappearance of retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, who vanished during a trip to Iran in 2007. The Post’s U.N. petition paints a portrait of sustained mistreatment of its Tehran correspondent, including months of solitary confinement, grueling interrogations and inadequate medical treatment for Rezaian’s deteriorating health. His Iranian captors also committed gross violations of international norms by refusing to publicly explain the reasons for Rezaian’s arrest or to allow him to review any evidence to support vague accusations of espionage against him, company officials said in papers filed Tuesday in New York. “These human rights violations are compounded by the fact that Rezaian’s detention appears to have been used as leverage by a certain faction of the Iranian Government in the long-running nuclear negotiations with the United States and other nations — a diplomatic dialogue wholly unrelated to Rezaian, and over which he has no control,” the petition states. Company officials said they hope an official finding by the U.N. council could amplify the pressure on Iran, even as The Post, family members and others pursue Rezaian’s release through other channels. “We believe the time has come to bring a very public, adversarial case against Iran,” said Jay Kennedy, a Washington Post vice president and general counsel. “Given the complete lack of evidence that Jason committed any crime, we expect the Working Group to conclude, as we have, that the government of Iran arrested and detained Jason for his work as a journalist and will find that detention unlawful.” Rezaian was arrested along with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, at the couple’s home in Tehran on July 22, 2014. At the time of his arrest, Rezaian had been working for two years as The Post’s Tehran correspondent and had been granted press credentials by the Iranian government. Although the Iranian Revolutionary Court, which is overseeing the case, has made no public pronouncement about the charges against Rezaian, Iranian news media have reported that the correspondent is being tried for espionage and engaging in “propaganda against the establishment” — accusations that Post officials have rejected as patently false. The papers filed by The Post on Tuesday indicated that Iranian authorities seized computers, notes, passports, books and other personal effects when they entered the couple’s home. Rezaian’s wife was later released on bail, as were two friends who were arrested the same evening. Rezaian eventually was taken to Evin Prison, a facility human rights groups have long associated with torture and abuse. There, he was kept in solitary confinement and “relentlessly interrogated” while being deprived of sleep and essential medical care, The Post’s petition asserts. “He has been humiliated, mistreated, and deprived of even the most basic facilities; at various points in his detention, he has even been denied access to a bathroom,” the document states. Iranian officials refused for weeks to allow Rezaian to have contact with outsiders, including his wife, other family members or Swiss diplomatic officials who represent U.S. consular interests in Iran. Long deprived of medicine for high blood pressure and other ailments, Rezaian began to suffer from chronic infections and lost nearly 50 pounds, The Post said, citing accounts from family members who were eventually permitted brief visits with him. “Rezaian’s psychological well-being and physical health have severely declined,” the petition states, “and his condition worsens with each day in confinement.” The news organization further accuses Iran of violating international treaties and its own constitution with an arrest and detention that were an “arbitrary deprivation of liberty.” As a signatory to the 1976 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Iran pledged to guarantee basic rights to those accused of criminal offenses, including the right to be informed of the reasons for an arrest and the right to a fair and speedy trial. “He has been deprived of due process and denied his rights to counsel of his choosing and to consular visitation,” The Post said in its petition to the Working Group, which investigates allegations of unjust detention. “Nearly five months of detention passed before Rezaian was charged with any crime, and to this day, the Government of Iran has failed to publicly disclose the charges against him.” Scholars and human rights experts familiar with Iran’s handling of high-profile detentions said last week’s nuclear accord may have helped lay the groundwork for Rezaian’s release. But still uncertain are how quickly he could be set free and whether the journalist’s confinement is re­lated to the nuclear dispute or some still-murkier conflict between Iranian factions. Haleh Esfandiari, an Iranian former journalist who spent 110 days in Evin Prison, said Rezaian’s arrest was probably an attempt by hard-line opponents of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to embarrass the moderate leader just as he sought rapprochement with the West. Now that the talks have ended, Rezaian could be freed, though perhaps not so quickly, she said. “Letting Jason go immediately would be seen as a sign of weakness, especially among the opponents of the nuclear deal in Iran,” said Esfandiari, director emerita of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Other Iran experts said exerting more international pressure on Iran could finally persuade Iran’s leaders to relent, though it still might take time to coax a decision from Iran’s famously opaque legal system. “You have a judicial process that is anything but fair or independent,” said Faraz Sanei, a researcher and Middle East expert with Human Rights Watch. “That — and not the official government line touting Iran’s supposedly fair and impartial administration of justice — is the ugly reality of the process Jason and many others have been subjected to.” Read more: A timeline of Jason Rezaian’s year in an Iranian detention Today's coverage from Post correspondents around the world","The ordeal started with a crash through the door as Iranian police stormed reporter Jason Rezaian’s house late at night.

0,"ONE YEAR ago on Wednesday, Iranian Revolutionary Guards broke into and ransacked the Tehran home of Post reporter Jason Rezaian and arrested him and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi. There began a blatant abuse of human rights and Iranian and international law that continues to this day. As a petition submitted by The Post Tuesday to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention summarizes it, “since his arrest, Rezaian has been harshly interrogated for days and weeks at a time, kept for long periods in solitary confinement, deprived of his rights to counsel and to consular visitation, and detained for almost a year without trial.” Ms. Salehi was released on bail but remains subject to charges. Since it finally began on May 26, Mr. Rezaian’s trial has been held in secret before a judge who previously was blacklisted by the European Union for his abuses. According to The Post’s petition, in the three court sessions held at irregular intervals so far, “there have been no live witnesses, no real evidence, and nothing to justify the charges, much less anything to prove that Rezaian is guilty of a crime.” Though Iran has never publicly disclosed the charges against Mr. Rezaian, his lawyer has said they include espionage and collaborating with hostile governments. Public reports indicate that the only purported evidence authorities presented are an online job application Mr. Rezaian submitted to the Obama administration’s transition team in 2008 and a message to a U.S. consulate about a visa for his wife. No wonder the State Department, which commonly refuses to comment on espionage cases, has called the charges against Mr. Rezaian “patently absurd.” Mr. Rezaian, 39, has now been detained in Iran longer than any other Western journalist. Born and raised in California, he moved to the country in 2008 with the ambition of promoting greater understanding between Iran and the United States. His reward was to be abruptly and unjustly confined to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where his physical and psychological health have undergone a steep decline. Hard-liners in the Iranian regime appear to be using him as a pawn to prevent the very improvement in relations that Mr. Rezaian hoped for. The Post’s petition spells out the multiple ways that Mr. Rezaian’s detention has violated Iran’s own laws, as well as international conventions. His prolonged solitary confinement was illegal: Though Iranian law limits such treatment to 20 consecutive days, Mr. Rezaian was held in solitary for 90 days or more. Also illegal was the failure to bring formal charges against Mr. Rezaian for more than five months and the severe restriction of his legal representation. Iranian law says no person may be detained for more than a year, unless charged with murder; yet Mr. Rezaian remains imprisoned. The petition asks for urgent action by the U.N. working group, including an opinion finding Mr. Rezaian’s detention to be a violation of treaties Iran has ratified. We hope the response will be swift. But what’s most needed is action in Tehran. On Wednesday, the country’s deputy foreign minister confirmed that there had been talks with the United States on the case of Mr. Rezaian and other imprisoned Americans for “humanitarian” reasons. Those considerations alone should justify Mr. Rezaian’s immediate release.

There began a blatant abuse of human rights and Iranian and international law that continues to this day. As a petition submitted by The Post Tuesday to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention summarizes it, “since his arrest, Rezaian has been harshly interrogated for days and weeks at a time, kept for long periods in solitary confinement, deprived of his rights to counsel and to consular visitation, and detained for almost a year without trial.” Ms. Salehi was released on bail but remains subject to charges. Since it finally began on May 26, Mr. Rezaian’s trial has been held in secret before a judge who previously was blacklisted by the European Union for his abuses. According to The Post’s petition, in the three court sessions held at irregular intervals so far, “there have been no live witnesses, no real evidence, and nothing to justify the charges, much less anything to prove that Rezaian is guilty of a crime.” Though Iran has never publicly disclosed the charges against Mr. Rezaian, his lawyer has said they include espionage and collaborating with hostile governments. Public reports indicate that the only purported evidence authorities presented are an online job application Mr. Rezaian submitted to the Obama administration’s transition team in 2008 and a message to a U.S. consulate about a visa for his wife. No wonder the State Department, which commonly refuses to comment on espionage cases, has called the charges against Mr. Rezaian “patently absurd.” Mr. Rezaian, 39, has now been detained in Iran longer than any other Western journalist. Born and raised in California, he moved to the country in 2008 with the ambition of promoting greater understanding between Iran and the United States. His reward was to be abruptly and unjustly confined to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where his physical and psychological health have undergone a steep decline.

1,"The lawyer for a Washington Post journalist facing trial in Iran on charges including espionage pressed Tuesday for his immediate release from prison following the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers, according to Iranian media. Her comments did not, however, include details of the next step in the closed-door proceedings against Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, who has been in Iranian custody for more than a year. He has denied all the allegations against him. Last week, President Obama said U.S. officials will not “relent” until Iran frees Rezaian and two other American citizens known to be detained there. Obama also demanded that Iran offer further information on the whereabouts of a former FBI agent who was last seen in that country in 2007. Rezaian’s lawyer, Leila Ahsan, was quoted by the semiofficial Tasnim and Fars Iranian news agencies as saying that the nuclear deal reached this month should spur Rezaian’s release from Tehran’s Evin Prison. The accord, which limits Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for the easing of international sanctions, still must clear several hurdles, including a review by U.S. lawmakers. Ahsan also alluded to new Iranian laws that Rezaian’s family has insisted prohibit holding someone in detention for more than a year on charges other than murder. “He has been jailed over a year and . . . keeping him in jail is illegal based on Iran’s new penal code,” she said. Ahsan did not suggest that an immediate release was likely. She said last week that she believes the next hearing in the case in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court could bring the trial to a close, but a date for that hearing has not been set. Ahsan was unavailable Tuesday for further comment. She is barred from discussing the case with journalists outside Iran. Rezaian, 39, The Post’s bureau chief in Tehran, was detained July 22, 2014, along with his Iranian wife and two photojournalists, and has reportedly been accused of espionage and engaging in “propaganda against the establishment.” His wife, Yeganeh Salehi, a correspondent for the National newspaper in Abu Dhabi, was later released on bail. One of the photojournalists also faces charges related to the case. Rezaian’s case has prompted worldwide appeals for his release, including a letter last week from media freedom group the Committee to Protect Journalists, asking the head of Iran’s judiciary to intervene to free Rezaian, a dual citizen of Iran and the United States. In a separate initiative, The Post submitted a petition to a U.N. panel on arbitrary detention that outlines what the Post described as Rezaian’s mistreatment, including long stretches of solitary confinement, and says Iranian authorities have produced “nothing to justify the charges.” The Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, also has repeatedly called for Rezaian’s release and has described the charges as groundless. Two other American citizens are held by Iran. Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor, has been in Iranian custody since September 2012. He was later convicted of security-related charges that include claims of proselytizing. Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine, was detained in August 2011 while on a family visit to Iran. He was convicted in early 2012 on espionage and other charges. A death sentence was later reduced to 10 years in prison, according to the family’s Web site. A former FBI agent and CIA contractor, Robert Levinson, was last seen publicly in March 2007 on the Iranian resort island of Kish, where he was investigating cigarette smuggling on behalf of a client. Iran denies knowledge of Levinson’s location or any involvement in his disappearance. A video circulated in December 2011 purported to show Levinson but offered no clear indication of his whereabouts. Iran denies that it is holding him.

0,"The drawn-out, closed-door trial of a Washington Post journalist detained in Iran on charges that include espionage could be nearing an end. A final hearing for Jason Rezaian in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court is expected to take place Monday, according to a statement from Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron. Baron said Rezaian’s attorney in Tehran, Leila Ahsan, has indicated that this will be the final hearing before a verdict is reached. It is not known how long the court will take to reach a finding. Rezaian, The Post’s Tehran bureau chief, has been in custody for more than a year on allegations related to spying, which he has strongly denied. His case has drawn widespread calls for his release. Last month, President Obama said his administration is “not going to relent” until Iran frees Rezaian and two other Americans being detained there. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists appealed to the head of Iran’s judiciary to ensure that the case is “resolved immediately and that Jason returns to his family.” On Saturday, Baron called for an end to a “sham trial.”   “This is a critical moment,” Baron said in his statement. “Iran has behaved unconscionably throughout this travesty of a case. It has imprisoned an innocent journalist for more than a year and subjected him to physical mistreatment and psychological abuse.” The Post has submitted a petition to a U.N. panel on arbitrary detention that outlines what the publication described as Rezaian’s ill-treatment, including long stretches of solitary confinement. Mark Toner, deputy spokesman for the State Department, addressed the matter Saturday. “We’re aware of the reports of another possible upcoming court appearance for Jason Rezaian,” Toner said. “We continue to call for his immediate release, as well as that of Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati. And for Iran to work with us to locate Robert Levinson, so that all may be returned to their families.” Rezaian was arrested July 22, 2014, in Tehran, along with his wife and two photojournalists. His wife, Yeganeh Salehi, an Iranian citizen and a correspondent for the National newspaper in Abu Dhabi, was later released on bail. One of the photojournalists also faces charges related to the case. Some of the claims against Rezaian, who holds U.S. and Iranian citizenship, appear to stem from a visit he made to a U.S. consulate seeking a visa for his wife and from a letter he wrote seeking a job in the Obama administration in 2008 — material that was apparently taken from his confiscated laptop. The two other Americans known to be held by Iran are Abedini, a Christian pastor, and Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine. Abedini, who has been in Iranian custody since September 2012, was convicted on security-related charges that include claims of proselytizing. Hekmati, detained in August 2011 during a family visit to Iran, was convicted in 2012 on espionage and other charges. A death sentence against him was later commuted to 10 years in prison, according to the family’s Web site. Levinson, a former FBI agent and CIA contractor, was last seen publicly in March 2007 on the Iranian resort island of Kish, where he was investigating cigarette smuggling on behalf of a client. Iran denies knowledge of Levinson’s whereabouts or any involvement in his disappearance. Monday’s hearing would mark only Rezaian’s fourth day in court since his trial started in late May. His brother, Ali Rezaian, of California, said he was encouraged that news of this final hearing came on what is celebrated in Iran as National Journalists’ Day.

0,"THE SIGNING of the nuclear deal with Iran last month touched off an unseemly rush by European governments and investors to cash in on a hydrocarbon-producing country with a deep need for investment and 80 million deprived consumers. The weekend after the end of the talks, Germany’s energy and economics minister was in Tehran with a delegation of business executives. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who struck a pose as skeptic of the deal before it was concluded, landed a few days later. Investors from Spain, Italy and Switzerland, among others, are joining what some are describing as an incipient gold rush. Most likely, the bracing reality of Iran will bring most back down to earth. Iran is No. 130 out of 189 nations on the World Bank’s ranking of ease of doing business. Corruption is rampant and many industries are controlled by the malignant Revolutionary Guard, whose leaders oppose any opening to the West. It remains to be seen whether even big oil companies such as France’s Total and Italy’s Eni, which worked in Iran before sanctions were imposed, will be offered sufficient incentives to invest in new production at a time of a global oil market glut. For investors on the fence, we have some advice: Before joining the crowd in Tehran, wait to see what happens to Post reporter Jason Rezaian. Three weeks after the nuclear deal was signed, Mr. Rezaian still sits in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where he has been held since his arrest on July 22, 2014. His continued detention violates multiple Iranian and international laws, including one very simple one: An Iranian statute says no suspect who has not yet been convicted may be held for more than a year, unless accused of murder. The charges against Mr. Rezaian have never been publicly announced, but according to his lawyer they include espionage and aiding a hostile government, not homicide. Only three sessions of his trial have been held since May 26, and no live witnesses or substantial evidence have been presented to support the charges, which the State Department has called “patently absurd.” Many analysts believe his prosecution has been orchestrated by hard-liners in the Revolutionary Guard and judiciary to undermine the nuclear deal and discredit its chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who has called Mr. Rezaian “a good reporter” and a “friend.” These circumstances should raise several questions for those contemplating investment in Iran. Can the government of Mr. Zarif and President Hassan Rouhani be relied upon when it makes promises about terms for Western companies — or will it be sabotaged by Revolutionary Guard commanders who wish to defend their corrupt economic interests and keep the West out? If there are legal disputes, can Iranian courts be relied upon to enforce even straightforward laws? And will Western business owners visiting Tehran be safe from the fate of Mr. Rezaian — a correspondent duly credentialed by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance who was abducted by security forces and held in solitary confinement for months without charge while being subjected to harsh interrogation?

0,"An Iranian court on Monday held its final hearing in the trial of a Washington Post journalist charged with espionage and other crimes, and a decision could come within the week, his attorney said. The move toward a possible verdict comes more than a year after Iranian authorities detained Jason Rezaian, The Post’s correspondent in Tehran. He has strongly denied the allegations against him, and the State Department, international media watchdog groups and others have pressed for his release. Some U.S. lawmakers have questioned why negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program did not include explicit demands for the release of Rezaian and other Americans held in the country. The Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, noted that no evidence had been presented against Rezaian in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court since the closed-door proceedings began in May. He urged Iran’s leaders to end the “nonsensical” prosecution and give back to Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, an Iranian journalist for the National newspaper in Abu Dhabi who faces similar charges, their “freedom and lives.” Rezaian’s attorney, Leila Ahsan, said the court has one week to deliver its verdict, according to a statement issued by Rezaian’s family. Ahsan, who is allowed to speak only to Iran-based media outlets, gave no other details. On Monday, the lawyer presented to the court “both verbal and written” briefs in which Rezaian “denied any wrongdoing” as he repeated his not-guilty plea, she was quoted as saying in the family statement. “There is no evidence that would support the charges against Jason,” the statement quoted her as saying. “I expect nothing but his full acquittal.” Ahsan also said she told the court that she “strongly objected” to secret evidence shared only between the judge and the prosecution. “By Iranian law, only evidence in the case file can be used against my client,” she told Rezaian’s family, according to the statement. Rezaian reportedly faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The charges against him include espionage and distributing propaganda against Iran. Rezaian, 39, a dual Iranian-American citizen, was detained in July 2014 with his wife and two photojournalists. Salehi was later released on bail. One of the photojournalists also faces charges related to the case. Some of the claims against Rezaian appear to stem from a visit he made to a U.S. Consulate seeking a visa for his wife and from a job application he sent to the Obama administration in 2008 — material that was apparently taken from his confiscated laptop. “After just four secret hearings in 10 weeks, the sham trial of The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian has ended in Tehran, but it remains unclear even to Jason’s lawyer what might happen next,” Baron said a statement. “No verdict was announced and Iran’s Revolutionary Court has offered no official indication of when such an announcement might come.” Baron added: “The process has been anything but transparent and just, and that pattern persists. The only thing that is clear is Jason’s innocence. He is a dedicated, law-abiding journalist and a good man who has been targeted with nonsensical, unsupportable, and entirely baseless allegations of espionage and other offenses. “He has been made to suffer physically and psychologically, and for that there is no excuse. His arrest, imprisonment, and now this sham trial contradict every standard required for the fair administration of justice, and they violate international law, Iran’s own laws, and fundamental human decency. “Now is the time for Iran’s senior leaders to end this ‘judicial process,’ with its sick brew of farce and tragedy. Jason and his wife, Yeganeh, who has been out on bail, deserve to be exonerated and to be given back their freedom and lives.” Family members and others have been blocked from attending the court sessions. Outside the courtroom, Rezaian’s mother, Mary Breme Rezaian, said her son was targeted by Iranian hard-liners and is “paying the price of the suspicion, the animosity and the paranoia between the two countries.” “Any verdict besides acquittal is a political verdict,” she told journalists. Ali Rezaian, who has been leading a U.S.-based campaign for his brother’s release, called Iran’s actions “unconscionable.” “My brother’s life has been cruelly interrupted for over a year for crimes he did not commit,” Ali Rezaian said in a statement. “His unlawful detention has carried on for far too long and he deserves to be vindicated and set free without further delay.” Read more: The risks of investing in Iran Post editor: Obama administration should ‘work harder’ for Rezaian’s release Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world","An Iranian court on Monday held its final hearing in the trial of a Washington Post journalist charged with espionage and other crimes, and a decision could come within the week, his attorney said.

Ali Rezaian, who has been leading a U.S.-based campaign for his brother’s release, called Iran’s actions “unconscionable.” “My brother’s life has been cruelly interrupted for over a year for crimes he did not commit,” Ali Rezaian said in a statement. “His unlawful detention has carried on for far too long and he deserves to be vindicated and set free without further delay.” Read more: The risks of investing in Iran Post editor: Obama administration should ‘work harder’ for Rezaian’s release Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world"
0,"U.N. human rights experts expressed grave concern Friday about Iran’s continued detention of Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian and called on authorities in Tehran to release him immediately. “The arrest, detention and secret trial of Mr. Rezaian violate his rights and intimidate all those working in the media in Iran,” said David Kaye, the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression. “His continued detention violates basic rules that not only aim to protect journalists, bloggers, human rights activists and others, but to guarantee everyone’s right to information.” Two other U.N. human rights experts, including the head of the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, backed calls for Rezaian’s release. Their statements came as the Working Group, a component of the U.N. Human Rights Council, considered an “urgent action” request that The Post submitted last month on the first anniversary of Rezaian’s arrest. Also reviewing the request were five U.N. special rapporteurs, two of whom joined Friday’s appeal to Iran to free Rezaian. The Post formally petitioned the U.N. Working Group for help in securing Rezaian’s release, accusing the Iranian government of flagrant human rights violations during the “arbitrary and unlawful” detention of the journalist. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, said in a statement that the independent U.N. experts have “sounded a powerful call for the government of Iran to uphold its international legal obligations in a case that has been anything but just.” “This call by three U.N. human rights experts comes at a critical moment, with Jason facing a verdict any day in Iran’s Revolutionary Court on nonsensical and unsupportable charges that include espionage,” Baron said. “The statement upholds our view that Iran’s conduct in this contemptible case has violated international law, Iran’s own laws, and fundamental human decency.” Baron added: “This is a call that Iran must heed. The experts, including the current head of the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, are independent, highly-regarded specialists from a variety of countries appointed by the United Nations to play leading roles on issues involving the freedom of opinion and expression, arbitrary detention and on human rights in Iran.” The U.N. human rights experts noted that Rezaian has been accused in secret proceedings of “espionage, collaboration with hostile governments, gathering classified information and disseminating propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran.” Rezaian “seems to have been detained for the simple fact of having exercised his rights to freedom of expression, association and political participation,” said Seong-Phil Hong, a human rights expert who heads the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. “His rights to legal counsel of his choice and to due process of law seem to have been forgotten.” Ahmed Shaheed, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, urged Iran to ensure that journalists do not face prosecution for their reporting. “Mr. Rezaian’s case is part of a broader crackdown on freedom of expression in Iran,” he said. “Journalists must be protected, not harassed, detained or prosecuted.” Shaheed and Kaye are among the five special rapporteurs who are reviewing The Post’s request for help. In their statement Friday, Shaheed, Kaye and Hong said Rezaian was placed in solitary confinement for five months and subjected to full-day interrogation sessions that caused significant physical and psychological strain, including dramatic weight loss, respiratory problems and chronic infections. “He has suffered unlawful treatment during his year-long incarceration,” Hong said. “We urge the Iranian government to release Mr. Rezaian as well as all those exercising their rights to expression who have been arbitrarily arrested, detained and prosecuted,” the human rights experts said in the joint release. The statement said the experts “are independent from any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity.” The Post hopes that the U.N. Working Group “will soon take further action in response to our petition and issue a separate urgent appeal to Iran . . . and demand that Iran immediately release him,” Baron said in his statement. “Against the backdrop of an impending verdict in so abominable a case, this important statement by United Nations’ human rights experts . . . should command Iran’s and the world’s attention,” he said. Rezaian, The Post’s bureau chief in Iran and a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen, was arrested along with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, when security forces raided their home in Tehran on July 22, 2014. She was released on bail in October, but Rezaian languished in Tehran’s Evin Prison for months without trial or even specific charges. He turned 39 there on March 15 and has spent more time in detention than any other Western journalist in Iran. Rezaian went on trial May 26 behind closed doors in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court on charges that included espionage. Three subsequent sessions were held, one of them a day before the conclusion of a July 14 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, including the United States. The court held its final hearing in the case on Aug. 10, and a verdict is expected soon, Rezaian’s lawyer said. Rezaian has denied the charges against him, which appeared to stem in part from a visit he made to a U.S. consulate regarding a visa for his wife and a letter he wrote seeking a job in the Obama administration in 2008. The letter was apparently taken from his confiscated laptop after his arrest. In a statement coinciding with the end of what he called the Revolutionary Court’s “sham trial,” Baron urged senior Iranian leaders to “end this ‘judicial process,’ with its sick brew of farce and tragedy,” and exonerate Rezaian and his wife. The Post’s petition to the U.N. Working Group said Iran has violated its own laws, as well as international law, in Rezaian’s case. It noted that under Iranian law, an accused person cannot be detained longer than the minimum term for the alleged crime and not longer than one year for any crime except death-penalty offenses. It said Rezaian’s detention — now nearly 13 months — violates both principles. The petition accused Iran of “arbitrarily depriving Jason Rezaian of his liberty and subjecting him to abusive treatment,” including physical mistreatment and psychological abuse. Citing what it described as his deteriorating physical and mental health, the petition said, “Absent immediate action, Jason is in danger of further, more serious physical and psychological harm and continued decline.” It said Rezaian was denied basic due-process rights; authorities allowed him only one brief meeting with his lawyer before trial. “His trial has also been a sham, as he has not had a genuine opportunity to present his case, or even to challenge any purported evidence or witnesses against him,” the petition said. Compounding the human rights violations in the case, the petition said, Rezaian’s detention appears to be related to a factional struggle within the Iranian government over the nuclear negotiations with the United States and five other world powers. Presiding over the trial has been Abolghassem Salavati, a hard-line judge known for imposing draconian sentences — including long prison terms, lashings and execution — on political prisoners and detainees deemed a threat to national security. Salavati has been under European Union sanctions since 2011.

0,"AMERICANS ARE asking the extent to which Iran can be trusted — in its arms control commitments, its regional behavior and its treatment of foreign investors. One way to answer that question is to examine the extent to which Iran’s regime obeys its own laws, on which subject several United Nations human rights experts had some relevant things to say on Friday. They were examining the unjust incarceration of Post reporter Jason Rezaian, and their conclusions were stark. “He has suffered unlawful treatment during his year-long incarceration,” said Seong-Phil Hong, who heads the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. Mr. Rezaian has been held in Tehran’s infamous Evin prison since his arrest on July 22, 2014. This alone would appear to violate Iranian law, which says no suspect may be held for longer than a year unless accused of murder. The charges against Mr. Rezaian have never been made public, but according to his lawyer they do not include homicide. Apparently they center instead on what the State Department has called “patently absurd” allegations of espionage and aiding a hostile government, though it’s hard to know: His “trial” has been conducted in secret, with not even his relatives allowed to attend, and no live witnesses or substantial evidence have been presented. “Mr. Rezaian seems to have been detained for the simple fact of having exercised his rights to freedom of expression, association and political participation,” Mr. Hong said. “His rights to legal counsel of his choice and to due process of law seem to have been forgotten.” A second U.N. expert, David Kaye, the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, also sharply criticized Iran’s handling of the Rezaian case. “The arrest, detention and secret trial of Mr. Rezaian violate his rights and intimidate all those working in the media in Iran,” said Mr. Kaye. “His continued detention violates basic rules that not only aim to protect journalists, bloggers, human rights activists and others but to guarantee everyone’s right to information.” Both experts, along with Ahmed Shaheed, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, urged Mr. Rezaian’s prompt release, along with that of “all those exercising their rights to expression who have been arbitrarily arrested, detained and prosecuted.” Indeed, it is the highly arbitrary treatment of Mr. Rezaian and the disregard of the law that ought to concern everyone weighing the proper contours for future relations with Iran. Conversely, Iranian authorities, who reportedly may issue a verdict in the Rezaian case as early as Monday, ought to keep in mind how anything but immediate release and exoneration will affect their standing in the world.

0,"Tuesday is visitors’ day for Jason Rezaian, the day that Iranian authorities permit the imprisoned Washington Post journalist to see his mother and his wife. As they have every Tuesday for the past few weeks, Mary Rezaian and Yeganeh Salehi arrived at Tehran’s Evin Prison in the morning and walked through a labyrinth of halls to a waiting car that drove them to another building housing a small salon furnished with chairs around a coffee table. There they met, the two women sitting on either side of Rezaian, each holding one of his hands. But this Tuesday’s visit was unlike any other over the past month and a half that Mary Rezaian has been in Iran for her son. They are waiting for an imminent verdict in the case against The Post’s Tehran bureau chief, who has been held for 13 months and is accused of espionage and other crimes. The judge’s verdict could be handed down Wednesday. Or it may be next week. They have no hint when it will come, but they fear Rezaian will not be coming home anytime soon. “It’s safe to say he’s steeling himself,” said Mary Rezaian in a phone call after the weekly visit. “He’s preparing himself to hear a verdict other than acquittal. A severe verdict, with a long sentence. We’re preparing ourselves for anything. It would be wonderful, a miracle, if he were acquitted, but I think it’s highly unlikely.” During months of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, the United States repeatedly pressed Tehran to release Rezaian, 39, and at least two other Americans of Iranian heritage imprisoned there, plus provide information on a fourth man who disappeared during a 2007 visit. U.N. human rights officials also have called for Rezaian’s immediate release, saying his arrest on July 22, 2014, his lengthy detention and the secret trial are intimidating to journalists working in Iran. Senior Post editors and Rezaian’s family have said that Rezaian is innocent and that he was acting solely as a journalist before his arrest. His final court hearing was Aug. 10, and Iranian authorities gave conflicting indications of when a verdict may come down. His lawyer said she expected it within a week. A judiciary spokesman said Sunday that it would be announced this week or next. But the head of Tehran’s justice department said that no verdict has been decided, and it may be some time before his fate is determined. The wait is excruciating. “The past week was the hardest for me,” said Mary Rezaian. “I see the stress within everybody, including myself. We get up, we go walking. We go around looking for books for Jason. We find ways to do something different. We’re trying to maintain as much sanity as we can.” Mary Rezaian and Salehi, a journalist who was arrested with her husband but was released on bond until her own case comes up, have been allowed twice-weekly contacts with Rezaian. Every Friday, each woman is permitted four minutes on a phone call with him, though Mary Rezaian said that the regularity of that depends to some degree on who the guard is on any given Friday. Then there are the Tuesday visits. When Mary Rezaian arrived in Iran early this summer, she initially was separated from her son by a glass window and could speak to him only on a telephone. About a month ago, the judge issued an order that they be allowed to meet in the visiting salon. Mary Rezaian said they know they are being watched and listened to. She said Jason frequently asks about his brother, Ali, who has put his life on hold as he campaigns for Iran to release Rezaian. “He lives for his contact with us,” Mary Rezaian said of Jason. “Most of the time we’re together, we try to talk about happy things. Friends I’ve been in contact with. He wants to know about Ali and his family. We know there are cameras in the room. We figure our conversations are picked up.” Although Rezaian has lost a lot of weight during his lengthy imprisonment, he is able to exercise regularly, “just trying to make himself healthy for when he’s released,” Mary Rezaian said. Asked if her son believes he will be released eventually, she said: “Hope springs eternal. He’s always been an optimistic person. It may not be this week, or next month. But he’s innocent, I know that.” Read more: U.N. human rights experts call for ‘immediate release’ of Post’s Rezaian A timeline of Jason Rezaian’s year in an Iranian detention Washington Post petitions U.N. to help free journalist held in Iran More coverage on Post correspondent Jason Rezaian","Tuesday is visitors’ day for Jason Rezaian, the day that Iranian authorities permit the imprisoned Washington Post journalist to see his mother and his wife.

0,"A senior Iranian diplomat said the country is working through third-country channels to seek the release of at least 19 Iranians jailed in the United States, according to a report Friday, even as U.S. officials press Tehran to free Americans held in custody. The comments by Hassan Qashqavi, a deputy foreign minister, did not identify the Iranians he claimed are being held in the United States, but he described them as “political prisoners,” Iran’s official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Last month, the head of the Iranian parliament’s foreign policy and national security committee, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, ­issued a letter urging Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to demand the release of “a considerable number” of Iranians he claimed had been “unfairly jailed” by U.S. authorities for alleged sanctions violations.

High-profile cases have included that of Mansour J. Arbabsiar, an Iranian American from Texas who received a 25-year sentence in 2013 after pleading guilty to charges that included attempting to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington. Qashqavi did not specify which country was serving as an intermediary between Tehran and Washington, but the Swiss represent U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran. The disputes over detained citizens were not part of the agreement reached last month seeking to limit Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for easing economic sanctions. But President Obama and other top U.S. officials have demanded the Americans’ release in separate statements. Among the Americans held in Iran is Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, who has been charged with espionage and other alleged offenses.

The Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, has appealed for Rezaian’s immediate release and described the case as “contemptible.” At least two other Americans are held in Iran: Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor imprisoned there for conducting Bible studies, and Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine accused of spying.

0,"The writer is secretary general of Reporters Without Borders. Jason Rezaian must be acquitted and freed immediately. As the final hearing in the Iranian trial of The Post’s Tehran correspondent was brought to a close Aug. 10, the international community waits for a verdict. Rezaian is an American Iranian journalist working for one of the most respected media organizations in the world. Iran has now illegally detained an innocent man for 13 months. His arrest by Revolutionary Guards was arbitrary and illegal, taking place in the middle of the night with no indication of the charges brought against him until months later. The conditions of his detention at Evin Prison are also illegal. Rezaian has been subjected to long periods of solitary confinement, a tactic that was designed to extract a forced confession. This practice is in direct violation of Article 38 of the Iranian constitution. How can Iran justify violating its own laws? As a result of these tactics, Rezaian has suffered psychological and physical stress, severe weight loss and respiratory problems. Maintaining his detention in these conditions is unacceptable. The charges against him have no factual basis. Nothing in his journalistic activities could ever be interpreted as spying, collaborating with hostile governments, or gathering confidential information or propaganda against the Islamic republic, as his charges allege. His trial has been closed to the public and the media, and contrary to international law, Rezaian has been given extremely limited opportunity to defend himself or present his defense. The State Department has called the charges against Rezaian “absurd,” and President Obama has called on Iran to release him. Respected international journalists such as Christiane Amanpour and Anderson Cooper have denounced his detention and called for his release. A few days ago, human rights expert David Kaye, the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, said Rezaian’s “continued detention violates basic rules that not only aim to protect journalists, bloggers, human rights activists and others but to guarantee everyone’s right to information.” Another human rights expert, Seong-Phil Hong, head of the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, added: “Mr. Rezaian seems to have been detained for the simple fact of having exercised his rights to freedom of expression, association and political participation. His rights to legal counsel of his choice and to due process of law seem to have been forgotten.” It is said that Rezaian is the victim of an internal power struggle between rival Iranian factions. The Revolutionary Guards, responsible for Rezaian’s arrest, have been using him as a pawn in an ideological battle with Iran’s more moderate members of government, including President Hassan Rouhani. But even Rouhani has failed to fulfill his election campaign promises to improve journalists’ situations and press freedom in Iran. It is unfortunate that the nuclear talks have not resulted in the release of all Americans unfairly detained in Iran. Indeed, the talks have been disappointing in their exclusion of human-rights issues. The Iranian authorities think they can put off releasing prisoners of conscience until some unspecified date. But every second they wait to release Rezaian is an affront to justice. The only true path to peace is indeed through a greater respect for human rights. This path will need to include more than just Rezaian’s release. Reporters Without Borders has records of 10 journalists and 23 citizen-journalists in Iran’s prisons. Atena Ferghdani, Mohammad Sedegh Kabodvand and Narges Mohammadi, to name a few of these prisoners, are victims of an overall crackdown on press freedom that needs to be stopped.

0,"THE ABSURDITIES in Iran’s prosecution of Post reporter Jason Rezaian on bogus espionage charges continue to pile up. The last of four sessions of his trial was held on Aug. 10, and a spokesman for the judiciary said Sunday it was the final session. Iranian law says a verdict must be issued within a week of a trial’s conclusion. It also says no suspect may be held for more than one year without conviction. Yet Mr. Rezaian remained in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison on Monday, 405 days after his arrest, and no verdict in his case has been announced. His lawyer says she does not know why; she speculates that a verdict may have been issued but not revealed even to her. The delay, secrecy and blatant violation of Iran’s own laws betray both the weakness of the charges against Mr. Rezaian and the use of the case for political purposes. The purported evidence in the case is a disgrace to the Iranian judiciary: It reportedly includes an unsuccessful 2008 online job application by Mr. Rezaian to President-elect Obama’s transition team and a visa application submitted to a U.S. consulate for his Iranian wife. Several of the developments in the case occurred in concert with the international negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program, prompting many analysts to conclude that hard-liners in the regime were persecuting Mr. Rezaian in an attempt to undermine Tehran’s chief negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who has called the Post journalist a “friend.” If that is true, then the fact that Mr. Rezaian remains imprisoned, in violation of Iran’s laws, suggests that Mr. Zarif and President Hassan Rouhani have been unable to gain control over factions whose cooperation will be essential if the nuclear deal is to be successfully implemented. That ought to be a red flag for the Obama administration as well as for the five other governments that are parties to the deal, and it should be given some weight by those in Congress still considering whether to support the accord. We concluded in July that the deal is preferable to the alternatives — but the failure to release Mr. Rezaian since then is deeply troubling. The Rouhani government has a clear opportunity in the next two weeks to rectify the injustice done to Mr. Rezaian and to reassure the international community of its readiness to honor the nuclear accord. The annual United Nations General Assembly session begins on Sept. 15, and the deadline for a congressional vote on a nuclear deal is days later. Tehran can send a clear signal to both bodies by releasing Mr. Rezaian and the other Americans it is holding before those events.

1,"The speaker of Iran’s parliament suggested Thursday that Americans imprisoned in Iran, including a Washington Post reporter, could be swapped for Iranians in U.S. jails. Though Iranian officials have hinted obliquely at prisoner swaps before, the comment by Ali Larijani, interviewed by NPR during a visit to New York, was the most explicit yet. National Public Radio reporter Steve Inskeep tweeted the news late Thursday. Larijani was asked if the Iranian government might release the Americans, mentioning Jason Rezaian, the Post’s Tehran correspondent, detained for more than 13 months and awaiting a verdict on his trial for espionage and other related charges. Three other Americans are imprisoned or missing in Iran. “There are practical ways, of course,” Larijani replied, according to a transcript provided by NPR. “For example, there is a number of Iranians in prison here [in the U.S.]. Definitely for matters of this sort, one can come up with solutions. I think your politicians know about those ways.” Asked if Larijani was talking about prisoner swap, he said: “That’s one way. There are other ways that the judiciary systems of the two countries can come up with.” Iranian officials have called for freeing 19 Iranian citizens jailed in the United States on what Iran claims are unfounded charges of violating sanctions. Rumors have periodically floated that Iran wants to swap them for Rezaian, but Iranian authorities have denied it. Larijani broached the idea a day after the White House got enough support in Congress to ensure the Iran nuclear deal cannot be defeated when lawmakers vote on it next week. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Thursday the Iranian parliament, or majlis, also will hold a vote on the nuclear deal.

1,"The brother of detained Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian urged a U.N. rights panel Tuesday to help obtain the journalist’s release from an Iranian prison where he awaits a verdict after a trial on charges including espionage. Ali Rezaian, speaking to the U.N. Human Rights Committee at its meeting in Geneva, said Iran has violated its international commitments and its own law in detaining his brother for nearly 14 months and trying him in closed-door sessions of the Revolutionary Court. Jason Rezaian, The Post’s correspondent in Tehran, has strongly denied the charges. The case has brought widespread denunciations from Post executives, press-freedom groups and high-level U.S. officials. “To the extent Jason is being held for domestic or international political leverage, such tactics are illegal and inhumane,” Ali Rezaian said. “He and other journalists must not be imprisoned for exercising their rights and doing their jobs.” The Human Rights Committee monitors how nations implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Founded as a forum for complaints about human rights abuses, it has no enforcement power, and critics say it lacks other leverage. But the timing of Rezaian’s plea to the committee is awkward for Iran. President Hassan Rouhani is preparing to travel to New York to attend the annual U.N. General Assembly this month, and he is planning meetings with scholars and journalists to present Iran’s views on the nuclear agreement recently reached with six world powers, including the United States. Though the Obama administration has secured enough support in Congress to ensure the deal’s implementation, opposition remains strong. Polls show that most Americans mistrust Iran and expect it to cheat on its commitment to not seek nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Many members of Congress have criticized the administration for negotiating with Iran without obtaining the release of Rezaian and two other Americans held in prisons there, or getting information on the whereabouts of a fourth American, who disappeared in Iran. In his statement to the committee, Ali Rezaian noted that his brother has been in custody for 420 days. He was not charged for almost five months and spent months in solitary confinement. “Jason has been mistreated and psychologically abused,” Rezaian said. “He has suffered serious untreated infections, lost [55 pounds], and struggled with respiratory and other complications. His mental health deteriorates daily in the face of prolonged isolation and intimidation.” The last court date for Jason Rezaian, 39, was in early August, and typically a verdict comes within a week. There has been no explanation of why a decision has not been handed down yet. As a member of the United Nations, Iran is bound by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. “Yet, in this case, Iran has repeatedly — and to this date with impunity — violated those laws,” Ali Rezaian said. The committee also heard from Thomas Hughes, executive director of Article 19, a group dedicated to freedom of expression. It takes its name from a section of the human rights declaration that enshrines that right. “Jason’s case is emblematic of the fact that arbitrary detention remains Iran’s primary tool to suppress freedom of expression,” Hughes said. “Iran’s trial procedures make a mockery of international standards and domestic law.” Hughes cited two other journalists imprisoned in Iran whose cases he said are similar to Rezaian’s. Yaghma Fakhshami, a political reporter for the Rouzan newspaper, has been jailed since December 2014 on unknown charges, and Sarajeddin Mirdamadi has been convicted of conspiracy.","The brother of detained Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian urged a U.N. rights panel Tuesday to help obtain the journalist’s release from an Iranian prison where he awaits a verdict after a trial on charges including espionage.

0,"NEW YORK — Iran’s president on Friday urged “quicker” efforts to free citizens held in both Iran and the United States, offering potential new signals on the fate of a Washington Post journalist and other Americans in Iranian hands. The comments by Hassan Rouhani, who is in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly, followed earlier suggestions from Iranian officials about the prospect of prisoner exchanges. Rouhani told journalists he “doesn’t want to talk about the word ‘exchange’ ” but said he could explore channels to “move the legal files forward” in Iran with an aim of the joint release of those detained in both countries. “It is important to me to find a way, if there is a way, to set them free quicker,” Rouhani said. “I wish to set as many people free as possible.” Although Rouhani has limited sway over Iran’s judiciary — which is controlled by the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — he said he could use unspecified leverage such as “suggestions and various legal actions.” The Post’s Tehran correspondent, Jason Rezaian, has been detained since July 2014 and was tried this year on charges including espionage. He is awaiting a verdict from Tehran’s Revolutionary Court. At least two other Americans are held in Iran: Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor imprisoned for conducting Bible studies, and Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine accused of spying. Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent, disappeared in Iran in 2007, but his whereabouts are unclear. Rezaian, 39, who has dual Iranian and American citizenship, has strongly denied the charges against him. His case has drawn appeals for his release by senior U.S. officials, media freedom groups and The Post. Earlier this month, the speaker of Iran’s parliament, Ali Larijani, dropped hints about a prisoner swap, telling NPR that there were “practical ways” to deal with Americans held in Iran and mentioning “a number of Iranians in prison” in the United States. Iranian officials have called for freeing 19 Iranian citizens in U.S. custody on what Iran claims are unfounded charges of violating sanctions. In a wide-ranging interview in New York with U.S. media outlets, Rouhani said a nuclear deal reached in July with the United States and other world powers has helped offer room for greater dialogue between Tehran and Washington. He said implementation of the pact can lead to other agreements. Rouhani also said Washington now sees that Iran can contribute in the fight against terrorism, especially against the Islamic State, whose behavior he described as “inhuman, subhuman.” Iran already has been helpful in Iraq, he said, asserting that Baghdad and the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, would have fallen to the Islamic State without Iranian assistance. “The nuclear issue is a big test within the framework of issues” between the United States and Iran, he said. If there is success in implementing the agreement, “then perhaps we can build on that.” He spoke of “great opportunities” in Iran for U.S. companies after the nuclear deal and said they would face no obstacles from Iran. Despite past U.S.-Iranian tensions, “we must all think about mutual interests,” Rouhani said. “Certainly . . . we cannot live in the past forever.” The two countries, he said, need to change their attitudes toward each other and leave “the heavy burden of this past” behind. In sharp contrast to Rouhani’s remarks, Khamenei, the supreme leader who wields ultimate political and religious authority in Iran, has vowed that the nuclear agreement would not change Iran’s policies toward the United States or facilitate negotiations on other matters. He has described the nuclear accord as an exception to his refusal to have any dealings with what he calls the “arrogant” government in Washington. Regarding that sort of hostility and the ubiquitous “Death to America” chants that are a staple of officially sanctioned demonstrations in Iran, Rouhani said: “The meaning is not that the people of Iran have animosity to the people of the U.S.” Americans could go to Iran as tourists and “will see the warmth with which they will be greeted,” Rouhani added. “The people in Iran are angry at the policies of the United States of America. They primarily are targeting with this slogan, the policies of the U.S.” Asked whether he might shake President Obama’s hand if they cross paths at the United Nations, Rouhani said there were more important things to focus on. “Sometimes, President Obama writes me letters,” he said. “Sometimes, I write him letters.” He suggested that they can discuss issues that way for now. Rouhani was sharply critical of U.S. senators and others who criticized Iran during congressional debate over the nuclear agreement. These critics are “living on another planet,” and their comments were “very comedic, very strange,” he said, adding that some of them could not find Iran on a map. At the same time, Rouhani said, people in Iran need a better understanding of the United States: “The truth of the United States must be made known to them.” William Branigin in Washington contributed to this report.

Rouhani told journalists he “doesn’t want to talk about the word ‘exchange’ ” but said he could explore channels to “move the legal files forward” in Iran with an aim of the joint release of those detained in both countries. “It is important to me to find a way, if there is a way, to set them free quicker,” Rouhani said. “I wish to set as many people free as possible.” Although Rouhani has limited sway over Iran’s judiciary — which is controlled by the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — he said he could use unspecified leverage such as “suggestions and various legal actions.” The Post’s Tehran correspondent, Jason Rezaian, has been detained since July 2014 and was tried this year on charges including espionage. He is awaiting a verdict from Tehran’s Revolutionary Court. At least two other Americans are held in Iran: Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor imprisoned for conducting Bible studies, and Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine accused of spying. Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent, disappeared in Iran in 2007, but his whereabouts are unclear. Rezaian, 39, who has dual Iranian and American citizenship, has strongly denied the charges against him. His case has drawn appeals for his release by senior U.S. officials, media freedom groups and The Post. Earlier this month, the speaker of Iran’s parliament, Ali Larijani, dropped hints about a prisoner swap, telling NPR that there were “practical ways” to deal with Americans held in Iran and mentioning “a number of Iranians in prison” in the United States. Iranian officials have called for freeing 19 Iranian citizens in U.S. custody on what Iran claims are unfounded charges of violating sanctions. In a wide-ranging interview in New York with U.S. media outlets, Rouhani said a nuclear deal reached in July with the United States and other world powers has helped offer room for greater dialogue between Tehran and Washington. He said implementation of the pact can lead to other agreements. Rouhani also said Washington now sees that Iran can contribute in the fight against terrorism, especially against the Islamic State, whose behavior he described as “inhuman, subhuman.” Iran already has been helpful in Iraq, he said, asserting that Baghdad and the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, would have fallen to the Islamic State without Iranian assistance. “The nuclear issue is a big test within the framework of issues” between the United States and Iran, he said. If there is success in implementing the agreement, “then perhaps we can build on that.” He spoke of “great opportunities” in Iran for U.S. companies after the nuclear deal and said they would face no obstacles from Iran. Despite past U.S.-Iranian tensions, “we must all think about mutual interests,” Rouhani said. “Certainly . . . we cannot live in the past forever.” The two countries, he said, need to change their attitudes toward each other and leave “the heavy burden of this past” behind. In sharp contrast to Rouhani’s remarks, Khamenei, the supreme leader who wields ultimate political and religious authority in Iran, has vowed that the nuclear agreement would not change Iran’s policies toward the United States or facilitate negotiations on other matters. He has described the nuclear accord as an exception to his refusal to have any dealings with what he calls the “arrogant” government in Washington. Regarding that sort of hostility and the ubiquitous “Death to America” chants that are a staple of officially sanctioned demonstrations in Iran, Rouhani said: “The meaning is not that the people of Iran have animosity to the people of the U.S.” Americans could go to Iran as tourists and “will see the warmth with which they will be greeted,” Rouhani added. “The people in Iran are angry at the policies of the United States of America. They primarily are targeting with this slogan, the policies of the U.S.” Asked whether he might shake President Obama’s hand if they cross paths at the United Nations, Rouhani said there were more important things to focus on. “Sometimes, President Obama writes me letters,” he said. “Sometimes, I write him letters.” He suggested that they can discuss issues that way for now. Rouhani was sharply critical of U.S. senators and others who criticized Iran during congressional debate over the nuclear agreement. These critics are “living on another planet,” and their comments were “very comedic, very strange,” he said, adding that some of them could not find Iran on a map. At the same time, Rouhani said, people in Iran need a better understanding of the United States: “The truth of the United States must be made known to them.” William Branigin in Washington contributed to this report.

1,"NEW YORK — Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday that he would work for the release of three Americans imprisoned in Tehran if the United States would free Iranians held in U.S. prisons for sanctions violations. “If we can help free folks who are detained there and they can take reciprocal steps, we’d welcome that approach,” he said through an interpreter at a reception that the Iranian mission to the United Nations held for scholars who specialize in the Middle East as well as some journalists. Rouhani mentioned the jailed Americans after he had spent almost 90 minutes answering questions submitted in writing and then posed by the interpreter. He said the United States is holding people who are not guilty of any crime except working to get around sanctions the United States imposed to prevent corporations and individuals from doing business with Iran. The sanctions will start to be lifted soon as part of a landmark deal forged between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, to get Iran to curtail its nuclear program. Those who broke the sanctions, Rouhani said, “tried to do something which they won’t be punished for now.” Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif are in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. They are spending part of their time meeting with officials to discuss steps being taken as outlined in the nuclear agreement reached in July. In several interviews Rouhani has granted recently, he has repeatedly raised the issue of a prisoner exchange — three Americans for 19 Iranians. Among the Americans is Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post correspondent in Tehran who was arrested more than 14 months ago. He has been tried on espionage and related charges in a secret Revolutionary Court trial that apparently ended six weeks ago. No verdict has been announced. Rezaian’s family, the State Department and senior Post editors have said that Rezaian was wrongly charged for activities that are normal for a journalist. When Iranian officials have been asked about Rezaian’s case previously, they have said that Iran has a judicial process and that they have no control over it. The other Americans are Amir Hekmati of Flint, Mich., a former Marine who has been in prison for four years, and Saeed Abedini of Boise, Idaho, a pastor who was arrested for establishing home churches. A fourth American, Robert Levinson, is a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007 and whose whereabouts are unknown.","NEW YORK — Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday that he would work for the release of three Americans imprisoned in Tehran if the United States would free Iranians held in U.S. prisons for sanctions violations. “If we can help free folks who are detained there and they can take reciprocal steps, we’d welcome that approach,” he said through an interpreter at a reception that the Iranian mission to the United Nations held for scholars who specialize in the Middle East as well as some journalists.

0,"THIRTY-FIVE years ago, Americans were transfixed by the drama of 52 U.S. diplomats and other citizens being held as prisoners in the U.S. embassy in Iran. Those hostages had been taken on Nov. 4, 1979, and were not freed until Jan. 20, 1981 — 444 days. On Friday, The Post’s Jason Rezaian, a U.S. citizen and journalist seized in his home on July 22, 2014, could spend his 445th day in detention. Held in violation of Iran’s own laws, not to mention international conventions, he has become another de facto hostage. The case of Mr. Rezaian is less spectacular, superficially, than that of the U.S. diplomats. They saw the Tehran embassy overrun by a mob of militant students, while Mr. Rezaian faces criminal charges — albeit false charges manufactured months after his arrest — and has been unlawfully imprisoned. Over time, the pretense of legal process attached to The Post reporter’s case, which was flimsy to begin with, has crumbled altogether. By Iranian law, Mr. Rezaian should have been released on bail after a year of detention, since he had not been sentenced for a crime; he wasn’t. He should have been informed of a verdict within one week of the end of his trial on Aug. 10, but nearly two months later, none has been announced. Since it was presented at a closed trial — once again, in violation of Iranian law — what we know of the “evidence” against Mr. Rezaian is scant. But what has been reported in the Iranian media has been beyond ludicrous. On Sunday, a spokesman for an Iranian parliamentary committee told the official Fars News Agency that an intelligence report by the Revolutionary Guard identified Mr. Rezaian as part of a conspiracy to bring down the Iranian government by the sinister means of improving bilateral relations. “Jason Rezaian has had the duty to exercise the thoughts of those people in the U.S. Senate who believe that if the U.S. can revive its pre-Revolution relations with Iran, the Iranian government can be overthrown easily,” Fars quoted the spokesman as saying. Last week in New York, President Hassan Rouhani suggested that Mr. Rezaian and two other Americans jailed in Iran could be exchanged for 19 Iranians imprisoned in the United States. In essence, Iran’s president is openly wielding an innocent 39-year-old journalist as a bargaining chip to free people whom Mr. Rouhani says were prosecuted for violating U.S. sanctions. Asked about Mr. Rouhani’s comment, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said he had “yet to hear directly” about an Iranian swap proposal, but “we’ve had some conversations.” We aren’t privy to those talks or to the identities of those Iran seeks to free. What we do know is that they would have been convicted by an independent judiciary in a public process under the rule of law. Mr. Rezaian, in contrast, is not only not guilty of any crime, but also has never been plausibly accused of one, or prosecuted according to Iran’s laws. His continued detention should be as intolerable to the United States as was the captivity of the American hostages 35 years ago.

0,"An Iranian judiciary spokesman said Sunday that a verdict has been reached in the espionage case of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, though he offered no details. It was uncertain what the verdict is and whether there is a sentence. “The ruling on this case has been issued,” Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei said in his weekly televised news conference with Iranian journalists. “There is still the possibility of this ruling being appealed, and it is not final.” Rezaian, The Post’s Tehran correspondent, has become a symbol of the lack of press freedom in Iran, and the capriciousness of its government, since he was arrested July 22, 2014. His closed-door trial on espionage and related charges ended two months ago, and the delay in a verdict has never been explained. The Post has vehemently disputed the allegation that Rezaian was a spy. Executive Editor Martin Baron has said that Rezaian was acting solely as a journalist, and he has called the trial a “sham” and “a sick brew of farce and tragedy.” It is not known when the verdict was reached or when a possible sentence will be announced. Rezaian has 20 days to appeal any ruling. Under the Iranian legal system, the prosecutor also has the right to appeal if there is an acquittal, an outcome that is considered unlikely. By mentioning that the verdict is not final, Ejei, a former prosecutor general, seemed to suggest that the Iranian government considers Rezaian a candidate for a prisoner swap. Last month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he would work for the release of three Iranian Americans detained in Iran, including Rezaian, if the United States would free Iranians held in U.S. prisons for violating sanctions against their country. Iranian officials have said that 19 Iranians fall into this category, but neither Iran nor the Justice Department has named the individuals who might be on Tehran’s list. Given the opacity of the Iranian judicial system, the initial reactions to Sunday’s terse statement announcing a verdict were cautious. “There was no notice of the announcement, and we have no additional details on the verdict,” Rezaian’s brother, Ali, said after speaking to the defense attorney. He said they had no prior knowledge of a verdict. In a written statement, Ali Rezaian later said the announcement was “just another sad chapter” in his brother’s 14-month imprisonment. “It follows an unconscionable pattern by Iranian authorities of silence, obfuscation, delay and a total lack of adherence to international law, as well as Iranian law,” he said. “The Iranian government has never provided proof of the trumped-up espionage and other charges against Jason, so today’s vague statement on a purported verdict, while certainly disappointing to our family, is not surprising.” Ali Rezaian also appealed to the government to release his brother. “Jason was simply a journalist doing his job and following all the rules when he was wrongly arrested and imprisoned in Tehran’s infamous Evin Prison,” he said. “He is an innocent man that has been kept under harsh conditions to the detriment of his health and well-being for nearly 450 days. There is worldwide condemnation for the Iranian government’s unlawful detention of Jason and calls from across the globe for his immediate release. We remain hopeful that Jason will soon be released and reunited with this family.” The State Department was equally mystified about news of the verdict. “We’ve seen the news reports concerning a verdict in the case of U.S. citizen Jason Rezaian but have not yet seen any official confirmation or details of a specific verdict from Iranian authorities,” said John Kirby, a spokesman for the department. “We’re monitoring the situation closely, and we continue to call for all charges against Jason to be dropped and for him to be immediately released.” Baron said The Post knew little more than the sparse description in the official statement. “We are aware of today’s televised announcement by the Iranian government that a ruling has been issued in the case of The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian but that the ruling is ‘not final’ and could be appealed,” he said in a statement. “We have no further information at this time, and it is not clear whether this ruling includes a verdict or a sentence — or even whether its contents have been communicated to Jason or his lawyer. “This vague and puzzling statement by the government of Iran only adds to the injustice that has surrounded Jason’s case since his arrest 15 months ago. Jason is a victim — arrested without cause, held for months in isolation, without access to a lawyer, subjected to physical mistreatment and psychological abuse. The only thing that has ever been clear about this case is Jason’s innocence. If indeed a ruling has been issued and is now being reviewed, this puts the onus on Iran’s senior leaders to demonstrate the fairness and justice that could only lead to Jason’s exoneration and release.’’ Rezaian has been held in prison longer than any journalist in Iran and, since last week, longer than the U.S. Embassy hostages held from November 1979 to January 1981. Today is his 447th day in custody . He holds dual citizenship, a status that Iran does not recognize. Although he was born and raised in California to a father who immigrated from Iran, the Tehran government has treated him as a full Iranian citizen. The case against him was apparently built on what U.S. courts would consider circumstantial evidence. Iranian officials cited an online job application he sent to the White House and a visit to the U.S. Consulate in Dubai, where he was seeking a visa for his Iranian wife. The State Department has repeatedly called for Iran to release Rezaian as well as two other Iranian Americans being held in Iranian prisons on charges that the U.S. government considers spurious. During the lengthy negotiations for a nuclear agreement with Iran that is about to be adopted, negotiators often raised the detainees’ cases in sideline discussions. Many U.S. politicians have questioned why Washington did not demand the release of the American detainees in exchange for signing off on the nuclear deal.

0,"Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, imprisoned in Tehran for more than 14 months, has been convicted following an espionage trial that ended in August, Iranian media reported Monday. The verdict — belated and opaque — was strongly condemned by the journalist’s family and colleagues, as well as the U.S. government. State-run TV and the Iranian Students’ News Agency both quoted Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, a spokesman for Tehran’s Revolutionary Court, as saying Rezaian, 39, had been found guilty. But ­Mohseni-Ejei offered no specifics on which charges were involved or whether a sentence had been imposed. “He has been convicted, but I don’t have the verdict’s detail,” said Mohseni-Ejei, a hard-liner and former prosecutor who criticized Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif for shaking hands with President Obama during a chance encounter at the United Nations last month, comparing the gesture to consorting with the enemy. Rezaian faced four charges — the most serious being espionage. The judge who heard the case is known for handing down harsh sentences, and Rezaian potentially faces a sentence of 10 to 20 years. Rezaian and The Post have strongly denied the accusations, and the prosecution has drawn wide-ranging denunciations, including statements from the White House and press freedom groups. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, called the guilty verdict “an outrageous injustice” and “contemptible.” “Iran has behaved unconscionably throughout this case, but never more so than with this indefensible decision by a Revolutionary Court to convict an innocent journalist of serious crimes after a proceeding that unfolded in secret, with no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing,” he said in a statement. Because there was no announcement of a sentence, the judgment led to speculation that Iran would press for a prisoner swap with the United States. In recent weeks, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has repeatedly floated the idea that the authorities in Tehran could free Rezaian and two other Iranian American prisoners if Washington reciprocated by releasing 19 Iranian citizens in U.S. custody for circumventing sanctions. The Iranians have declined to say which prisoners they are referring to, but a number of Iranians and Iranian Americans have been convicted of attempting to circumvent U.S. economic sanctions and export controls on Iran. U.S. officials have declined to discuss any possible swap. The state-run Islamic Republic of Iran News Network reported Monday that Rezaian was accused of “spying on Iran’s nuclear programs” and providing the U.S. government with information on people and companies skirting sanctions. “The information that Rezaian provided to the Americans resulted in many Iranian and international businessmen and companies being placed on America’s sanctions list,” the network reported on its Web site. Rezaian’s trial was held entirely behind closed doors, and his attorneys were barred from discussing the proceedings. The few details that have emerged have been in Iranian news reports. Ali Rezaian said his younger brother, whose physical and mental health is deteriorating in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison, knows that a verdict was announced but nothing more. Rezaian’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and his mother went to court Monday with a defense lawyer seeking more information but came away empty-handed, he said. “This follows an unconscionable pattern by Iranian authorities of silence, obfuscation, delay and a total lack of adherence to international and Iranian law,” he said. The State Department described the process as “incomprehensible.” “Regardless of whether there has been a conviction or not, we continue to call for the government of Iran to drop all charges against Jason and release him immediately,” said State Department spokesman John Kirby. Born in Marin County, Calif., to an Iranian father and an American mother, Rezaian, a dual national, moved to Iran in 2008 and worked as a journalist for various publications, including the San Francisco Chronicle. He joined The Post in 2012 and wrote stories that he hoped would give readers a deeper and more nuanced view of Iran; one of the last before his arrest recounted the travails of the country’s fledgling baseball team. Rezaian and his wife were arrested on July 22, 2014, when plainclothes police raided their apartment. Two Iranian American photojournalists were also arrested. The photographers were later released, and Salehi was freed on bail two months later. She still faces prosecution and is barred from working as a reporter for her employer, the National newspaper in the United Arab Emirates. Many of the conditions of Rezaian’s detention violate Iran’s own laws and constitutional guarantees. He spent months in solitary confinement. He was also denied bail, a translator and, initially, legal representation. Iran does not recognize dual nationality, and it barred any U.S. role in the case, including consular visits by diplomats representing U.S. interests. During months of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, State Department officials repeatedly urged Iran to release Rezaian and two other imprisoned Americans, Saeed Abedini of Boise, Idaho, and Amir Hekmati of Flint, Mich. The talks were always on the sidelines, however, because negotiators did not want Iran to use them as a lever to extract concessions in the nuclear negotiations. The nuclear deal, which led Iran to accept limits on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, is as controversial in Tehran as it is in Washington. Relative moderates such as Rouhani want to open the country to more international trade. Hard-liners fear it will make Iran vulnerable to foreign influence and undermine the 1979 revolution. Some analysts believe Rezaian became ensnared in this fierce domestic policy debate, with hard-liners who control the courts and the intelligence agencies seeking to undercut Rouhani before February elections. “This is politicized justice at its worst,” said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. Other analysts believe the verdict also telegraphs to Rouhani that his power is limited. “I think it is all part of an effort to send a message to Rouhani that the nuclear deal is a one-off and that he will not be able to satisfy the demands of his supporters for a more liberal social order,” said Barbara Slavin, a fellow with the Atlantic Council who makes frequent trips to Iran. “In a way, Jason is a victim of the success of the nuclear talks.” Outside Iran, few believe Rezaian was acting in any capacity other than as a journalist. “The reason they have been very secretive about the case is they are using him as a pawn in a fight for the government,” said Omid Memarian, an Iranian journalist and a friend of Rezaian’s who is now living New York. “The hard-liners know the world has asked Rouhani to do something for Jason. He has to tell the world he cannot do anything. That undermines his authority. What kind of president cannot defend the rights of [his] citizens?” Haleh Esfandiari, an Iranian scholar at the Washington-based Wilson Center, said that the announced verdict suggests the hard-liners who control the Revolutionary Court have concluded that no prisoner swap with the United States is likely. “One has to bring a tremendous amount of pressure on the government of Iran now. Iran needs a face-saving solution,” said Esfandiari, who was arrested and detained in Iran in 2007 and accused of endangering national security. “That is the nature of the regime.” Read more: Journalists and family of Jason Rezaian denounce guilty verdict Martin Baron on the Jason Rezaian conviction A timeline of Jason Rezaian’s detention and conviction in Iran Full coverage on Post correspondent Jason Rezaian","Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, imprisoned in Tehran for more than 14 months, has been convicted following an espionage trial that ended in August, Iranian media reported Monday. The verdict — belated and opaque — was strongly condemned by the journalist’s family and colleagues, as well as the U.S. government. State-run TV and the Iranian Students’ News Agency both quoted Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, a spokesman for Tehran’s Revolutionary Court, as saying Rezaian, 39, had been found guilty. But ­Mohseni-Ejei offered no specifics on which charges were involved or whether a sentence had been imposed. “He has been convicted, but I don’t have the verdict’s detail,” said Mohseni-Ejei, a hard-liner and former prosecutor who criticized Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif for shaking hands with President Obama during a chance encounter at the United Nations last month, comparing the gesture to consorting with the enemy. Rezaian faced four charges — the most serious being espionage. The judge who heard the case is known for handing down harsh sentences, and Rezaian potentially faces a sentence of 10 to 20 years. Rezaian and The Post have strongly denied the accusations, and the prosecution has drawn wide-ranging denunciations, including statements from the White House and press freedom groups. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, called the guilty verdict “an outrageous injustice” and “contemptible.” “Iran has behaved unconscionably throughout this case, but never more so than with this indefensible decision by a Revolutionary Court to convict an innocent journalist of serious crimes after a proceeding that unfolded in secret, with no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing,” he said in a statement. Because there was no announcement of a sentence, the judgment led to speculation that Iran would press for a prisoner swap with the United States. In recent weeks, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has repeatedly floated the idea that the authorities in Tehran could free Rezaian and two other Iranian American prisoners if Washington reciprocated by releasing 19 Iranian citizens in U.S. custody for circumventing sanctions. The Iranians have declined to say which prisoners they are referring to, but a number of Iranians and Iranian Americans have been convicted of attempting to circumvent U.S. economic sanctions and export controls on Iran. U.S. officials have declined to discuss any possible swap. The state-run Islamic Republic of Iran News Network reported Monday that Rezaian was accused of “spying on Iran’s nuclear programs” and providing the U.S. government with information on people and companies skirting sanctions. “The information that Rezaian provided to the Americans resulted in many Iranian and international businessmen and companies being placed on America’s sanctions list,” the network reported on its Web site. Rezaian’s trial was held entirely behind closed doors, and his attorneys were barred from discussing the proceedings. The few details that have emerged have been in Iranian news reports. Ali Rezaian said his younger brother, whose physical and mental health is deteriorating in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison, knows that a verdict was announced but nothing more. Rezaian’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and his mother went to court Monday with a defense lawyer seeking more information but came away empty-handed, he said. “This follows an unconscionable pattern by Iranian authorities of silence, obfuscation, delay and a total lack of adherence to international and Iranian law,” he said. The State Department described the process as “incomprehensible.” “Regardless of whether there has been a conviction or not, we continue to call for the government of Iran to drop all charges against Jason and release him immediately,” said State Department spokesman John Kirby. Born in Marin County, Calif., to an Iranian father and an American mother, Rezaian, a dual national, moved to Iran in 2008 and worked as a journalist for various publications, including the San Francisco Chronicle. He joined The Post in 2012 and wrote stories that he hoped would give readers a deeper and more nuanced view of Iran; one of the last before his arrest recounted the travails of the country’s fledgling baseball team. Rezaian and his wife were arrested on July 22, 2014, when plainclothes police raided their apartment. Two Iranian American photojournalists were also arrested. The photographers were later released, and Salehi was freed on bail two months later. She still faces prosecution and is barred from working as a reporter for her employer, the National newspaper in the United Arab Emirates. Many of the conditions of Rezaian’s detention violate Iran’s own laws and constitutional guarantees. He spent months in solitary confinement. He was also denied bail, a translator and, initially, legal representation. Iran does not recognize dual nationality, and it barred any U.S. role in the case, including consular visits by diplomats representing U.S. interests. During months of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, State Department officials repeatedly urged Iran to release Rezaian and two other imprisoned Americans, Saeed Abedini of Boise, Idaho, and Amir Hekmati of Flint, Mich. The talks were always on the sidelines, however, because negotiators did not want Iran to use them as a lever to extract concessions in the nuclear negotiations. The nuclear deal, which led Iran to accept limits on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, is as controversial in Tehran as it is in Washington. Relative moderates such as Rouhani want to open the country to more international trade. Hard-liners fear it will make Iran vulnerable to foreign influence and undermine the 1979 revolution. Some analysts believe Rezaian became ensnared in this fierce domestic policy debate, with hard-liners who control the courts and the intelligence agencies seeking to undercut Rouhani before February elections. “This is politicized justice at its worst,” said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. Other analysts believe the verdict also telegraphs to Rouhani that his power is limited. “I think it is all part of an effort to send a message to Rouhani that the nuclear deal is a one-off and that he will not be able to satisfy the demands of his supporters for a more liberal social order,” said Barbara Slavin, a fellow with the Atlantic Council who makes frequent trips to Iran. “In a way, Jason is a victim of the success of the nuclear talks.” Outside Iran, few believe Rezaian was acting in any capacity other than as a journalist. “The reason they have been very secretive about the case is they are using him as a pawn in a fight for the government,” said Omid Memarian, an Iranian journalist and a friend of Rezaian’s who is now living New York. “The hard-liners know the world has asked Rouhani to do something for Jason. He has to tell the world he cannot do anything. That undermines his authority. What kind of president cannot defend the rights of [his] citizens?” Haleh Esfandiari, an Iranian scholar at the Washington-based Wilson Center, said that the announced verdict suggests the hard-liners who control the Revolutionary Court have concluded that no prisoner swap with the United States is likely. “One has to bring a tremendous amount of pressure on the government of Iran now.

1,"FROM ITS beginning, the case of Jason Rezaian has been a showcase for the opacity, the brazen disregard for the rule of law and, ultimately, the sheer cruelty of Iran’s Islamic regime. Its latest twist is no different. On Sunday, Iranian state television reported that the 39-year-old Post reporter had been convicted in a trial that ended two months ago. Convicted of what? Punished with what sentence? We don’t know: The court’s spokesman told state television he didn’t have “the verdict’s details.” Nor, it appears, did Mr. Rezaian’s lawyer, who told the New York Times she had not been informed of the verdict and did not know whether Mr. Rezaian himself knew it. Mr. Rezaian, who was arrested with his wife in their home on July 22, 2014, was held for months in solitary confinement without charge, in violation of Iranian law. He was then subjected to a secret trial on several charges, reportedly including espionage, in which the prosecution presented no live witnesses and no substantial evidence. Now, well after the deadline set by law, he has been subjected to a secret verdict. His lawyer, Leila Ahsan, told the Times that while an appeal is possible, she can’t contest a judgment she hasn’t seen. “Now, I do not know what I am appealing against,” she was quoted as saying. This travesty ought to shame the Iranian government into releasing the journalist — if only to forestall questions from would-be international investors in Iran, who have to wonder whether their personnel will be vulnerable to similarly arbitrary arrests and secret trials. Instead, President Hassan Rouhani appears to hope that Mr. Rezaian can be used as a bargaining chip to obtain the release of 19 Iranians he says were imprisoned in the United States for violating sanctions. A state television report Monday may have been trying to advance this cause when it claimed that Mr. Rezaian had provided the U.S. government with information about individuals who engaged in sanctions busting. Add that to the constantly shifting array of ludicrous charges that have been advanced by Iranian media against Mr. Rezaian since his arrest. Last week it was reported that he had conspired with U.S. senators to improve U.S.-Iranian relations, a development supposedly calculated to bring down the regime. What’s true is that Mr. Rezaian, who was born in California but is of Iranian heritage, pursued journalism in part to improve Americans’ understanding of Iran. Most people would consider that a good thing. However, Mr. Rezaian never pursued any activity in Iran other than journalism, as the country’s senior officials well know. He was accredited by the government, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called him “a good reporter.” That he has been unjustly imprisoned for longer than the American hostages were held in Tehran in 1979-81 makes a mockery of Mr. Zarif’s claims that Iran wishes to improve its relations with the outside world. It reveals Iran as a country where the most basic norms of justice are still grotesquely flouted and where taking prisoners to use as pawns is still regarded as an acceptable form of diplomacy. Iran has done extraordinary injury to Mr. Rezaian over the past 14 months. But the longer it holds him, the more damage it does to its international standing.

1,"The consequences of President Obama’s passive foreign policy came close to home this week. My Post colleague Jason Rezaian, the paper’s Tehran bureau chief, has been languishing in an Iranian jail for 15 months on bogus charges of espionage. He was put on secret trial by a kangaroo court. On Sunday, Iranian state TV reported that he had been convicted. And Obama said . . . nothing. He didn’t go to the briefing room and make a statement. He didn’t even release a written statement. On Tuesday, his press secretary, in response to a reporter’s question at the briefing, responded with what might have been described as minor annoyance with the Iranian regime. “We’ve got a number of concerns,” the spokesman said, mentioning the “unjust” detention and “opaque” process. Where was the demand that Iran immediately release Rezaian and the two or three other Americans it is effectively holding hostage? Where was the threat of consequences if Tehran refused? How about some righteous outrage condemning Iran for locking up an American journalist for doing his job? Even if Obama’s outrage came to nothing, it would be salutary to hear the president defend the core American value of free speech. Officials who defend Obama’s detached approach say this is an example of his patient diplomacy, his belief in playing the long game. If the president were to speak out passionately about Rezaian, they argue, Obama would only make Rezaian more valuable to the Iranians as a bargaining chit. That’s why a demand for his (and the others’) release wasn’t a condition of the nuclear deal. But at some point patience becomes passivity; Obama’s game is so long that it often appears he isn’t playing at all. In my colleague’s case, it’s baffling that the administration won’t use the considerable leverage it has. With sanctions easing because of the nuclear deal, Iran is hungry for U.S. investment. Would it really hurt the president to warn — accurately — that U.S. businesses will be reluctant to set up shop in a country that kidnaps and locks up Americans for no reason? Perhaps the Europeans, eager to invest in Iran, could use a reminder of this, too; British and Canadian nationals have been treated similarly. That’s the view of Ali Rezaian, Jason’s brother, who is frustrated with the public quiescence. “The administration needs to make it clear that businesses aren’t going to be able to engage in a state that treats foreigners like this and treats innocents like this,” he told me. If a journalist is called a spy for doing his job, imagine how the Iranians will treat Americans working for, say, defense contractors such as Boeing or General Electric. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, to his credit, is doing much behind the scenes to try to secure Rezaian’s release. Officials figure the (relatively) moderate President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif will be in a stronger position to push the ayatollahs to release the Americans after the lifting of sanctions boosts the Iranian economy. The goal is some sort of prisoner swap in which Rezaian, and perhaps the other Americans, are freed in exchange for the release of those held in the United States for violating sanctions against Iran. But the public posture of the White House is baffling, even to some in the administration. Those inside and outside the administration I’ve talked with say the detachment follows a familiar pattern. On issue after issue, national security adviser Susan Rice and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, channeling Obama’s own skittishness, have resisted more engagement when advocated by the likes of Kerry or U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. Obama, afraid of owning a foreign policy fiasco the way George W. Bush owned the Iraq war, has instead erred on the side of doing and saying little about problems. His few attempts at decisive policy — the “red line” in Syria, for example — have ended badly. And so Obama disengages. He has been reluctant to take on Russian aggression in Ukraine or China’s expansionism, and he has been maddeningly vague about Syria. The silence, and the resulting ambiguity about the American position, only create more chaos — and increase the need for the very intervention Obama dreads. This summer, Obama was furious when Major Garrett of CBS News asked him why he was “content, with all of the fanfare around this [nuclear] deal, to leave the conscience of this nation, the strength of this nation, unaccounted for, in relation to [the] Americans” detained by Iran. Obama lectured Garrett: “That’s nonsense, and you should know better.” If only Obama were willing to speak so forcefully and passionately to the Iranian regime, Jason Rezaian might be a free man.

0,"The Iran nuclear deal moved closer to reality Sunday as the United States and the European Union laid the legal groundwork for the eventual lifting of sanctions against the Islamic republic. President Obama signed an order directing government agencies to prepare to issue waivers on sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program. The European Union announced legal actions that clear the way for the release of an estimated $100 billion in frozen Iranian assets. Those measures will not take effect for months, and then only if Tehran satisfactorily meets the conditions spelled out in a landmark nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers, including the United States. The legal steps were required under the deal signed in Vienna in July. Sunday was designated as the agreement’s “Adoption Day,” 90 days after it was endorsed by the U.N. Security Council. “This is an important day for all of us and a critical first step in the process of ensuring that Iran’s nuclear program will be exclusively for peaceful purposes,” said Secretary of State John F. Kerry in a statement from Madrid, where he is meeting with Spanish officials. It is now up to Iran to start dismantling significant parts of its nuclear infrastructure. It must remove and place into storage thousands of centrifuges, slash its uranium stockpiles and pour concrete into the reactor core of its plutonium processing plant at Arak. It also must account for the possible military dimensions of its past nuclear activity, thought to have been abandoned a decade ago. Iran, however, has always denied pursuing nuclear weapons and said its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes. On Monday, State Department officials will be in Vienna for the first meeting of a joint commission made up of the countries that signed the nuclear deal and established to work out issues that arise as the deal is implemented. Stephen D. Mull, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland, and Thomas A. Shannon Jr., a State Department counselor, will represent the United States. The joint commission is expected to release plans for how China will help Iran modify the heavy-water reactor at Arak. Sanctions can be lifted only when all the agreed-upon steps are verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency — which will be called “Implementation Day.” Iran is impatient to jump-start its faltering economy before parliamentary elections in late February, and President Hassan Rouhani has said the complicated work needed to lift sanctions is expected to be completed in just six to eight weeks. The United States, skeptical it can be done that quickly, estimates the work could take six months or longer. The E.U.’s adoption of the legislative framework for lifting sanctions was announced in a joint statement by the its foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. “It will take effect on Implementation Day, simultaneously with the IAEA-verified implementation of agreed nuclear measures by Iran,” the statement said. In the three months since the deal was endorsed by the United Nations, Iran has tested a long-range ballistic missile thought to be in violation of U.N. sanctions unrelated to nuclear issues. It has convicted a U.S. citizen, The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent, Jason Rezaian, following a closed-door trial on espionage charges that it has still not officially explained. And it intervened militarily in Syria against positions of the militant Islamic State group. Iran’s actions have hardened criticism of the deal. U.S. Rep. Edward R. Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a statement calling the Obama administration “more naive by the day.” “It’s sure tough to look at Iran’s actions over the last three months — let alone 35 years — and think Tehran will live up to its end of the nuclear bargain,” he said. “If this is what the last 90 days look like, the next few years look like a disaster.” Kerry said the agreement represents a “measurable step away” from nuclear proliferation. “If fully implemented, it will bring unprecedented insight and accountability to Iran’s nuclear program forever,” Kerry said. “As we move from Adoption Day now towards Implementation Day, I and my entire team will remain vigilant and mindful of not just how far we have come, but how much further we have to go in seeing that this deal is fully implemented.”","The Iran nuclear deal moved closer to reality Sunday as the United States and the European Union laid the legal groundwork for the eventual lifting of sanctions against the Islamic republic.

0,"AS THEY concluded the nuclear deal with Iran in July, President Obama and Secretary of State John F. Kerry repeatedly suggested that it could open the way to cooperation with Tehran in resolving regional conflicts, beginning with the civil war in Syria. They also promised the United States would push back if Iran instead stepped up its aggression. Just three months later, Iran’s most notorious general is overseeing a new offensive by thousands of Iranian, Iraqi and Lebanese fighters aimed at recapturing the Syrian city of Aleppo from rebel forces, including some backed by the United States. Mr. Obama shows no sign of responding. The Iranian-led offensive, which is supported by Russian air power, appears to be the mostaggressive intervention yet by Iran in the Syrian war. The Post reported that hundreds of troops from the elite Quds Force had been joined by thousands of Iraqi Shiite militiamen and forces from Lebanon’s Hezbollah, all under the command of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who previously directed attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq. Far from accepting appeals from Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry to help broker a diplomatic settlement, Iran has joined with Russia to entrench the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and help it to recapture Aleppo and other parts of the country. The attack is one of several provocative steps Tehran has taken as the nuclear deal has begun to come into effect. The same day the accord was debated by its parliament this month, the regime test-fired a nuclear-capable missile, violating a U.N. Security Council resolution. The White House acknowledged the infraction but pointed out that it was outside the bounds of the nuclear agreement. Also that day, Iranian television reported that The Post’s Jason Rezaian had been convicted on espionage charges after a closed trial. The administration condemned the verdict. On Sunday, the United States and its European partners began taking steps to implement the nuclear accord. Much is now required of Iran: It must place 12,000 centrifuges into storage, ship 12 tons of enriched uranium out of the country and demolish the core of a plutonium reactor before it can receive the more than $100 billion in assets frozen under sanctions. It could be that the missile test and unjust conviction of Mr. Rezaian are the regime’s demonstration that its nuclear concessions will not change its hostile stance toward the West or its military ambitions. If so, it is a cruel tactic that uses Mr. Rezaian, a professional journalist and American citizen, as a human pawn. But the Syrian offensive is certainly more than message-sending. If successful, it could eliminate the chance to construct a moderate, secular alternative to the Assad regime, and send hundreds of thousands more refugees across Syria’s borders. It was just such aggression that Mr. Obama acknowledged might be a byproduct of the nuclear deal — and that he vowed to resist. If he remains passive as Maj. Gen. Soleimani’s forces press forward, both Iranian and U.S. allies across the Middle East will conclude that there will be no U.S. check on an Iranian push for regional hegemony.

0,"Dueling narratives in the Iranian press last week over a jailed Washington Post journalist are bringing into sharper focus the country’s internal political struggles and how they could be playing out as the reporter’s case moves toward sentencing on charges including espionage. The contrasting accounts in rival media — one conservative and the other reformist — emerged a week after an Iranian court announced it had convicted Post correspondent Jason Rezaian following a closed-door trial that drew widespread condemnation. Critics including rights activists and press freedom groups as well as United Nations experts and the White House denounced the trial as unfair and the charges as politically motivated. While the opposing Iranian media reports differed over various allegations against the 39-year-old Rezaian — including a claim that he had insider access to Iran’s reformist government — the broader implications highlight the long-running ideological clashes within Iran between entrenched hard-line factions and opponents seeking to undercut their influence. Rezaian’s attorney, his family and The Post strongly denied the charges, saying that all his contacts and work reflected only normal news gathering. Such power wrangling in Iran is not new. It goes back to the shake-outs after the 1979 Islamic revolution and flared with greater intensity after the election in 1997 of reform-leaning President Mohammad Khatami. But the current battles have had deeper resonance since Iranian negotiators reached a nuclear deal with world powers in July. The accord was seen as a slap at hard-liners and a boost for President Hassan Rouhani’s policies of moderation and outreach to the West. The power struggle also comes amid regional pressures on Iran in parallel fights to weaken one powerful foe, the Islamic State, and prop up a key ally, the embattled government of Syria. Within Iran, meanwhile, the political clock is ticking toward February’s elections for parliament, which has limited policymaking powers but remains an important baro­meter of the country’s mood. A victory for Rouhani’s backers in the elections would be a significant blow to the reach of ultraconservatives and anti-Western factions, who share ties with the powerful Revolutionary Guard and many clerics within the ruling theocracy. “The tug of war between hard-liners and their opponents touches almost every aspect of Iran,” said Rasool Nafisi, an Iranian affairs expert at Strayer University. “The courts and high-profile trials are no exception.” Such infighting has been pushed onto the world stage in the past by cases involving detained foreigners, including three American hikers accused of straying over the border in 2009 who were later freed in a two-stage release mediated by Oman. The prosecution of Rezaian, an ­Iranian American dual citizen, has further potential as a lightning rod after suggestions from Tehran of a possible swap for Iranians held in the United States. The list, while not made public, apparently includes some Iranians charged with violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran, which would be eased under the nuclear accord. Last week, Iran’s Fars News Agency — which has close ties to the Revolutionary Guard — quoted a high-ranking parliament member as offering the most detailed rundown of the purported allegations against Rezaian, who has been detained since July 2014 and has had limited access to his family and legal counsel. In the report, Javad Karimi-Qoddusi, a member of the security and foreign affairs committee in Iran’s parliament, was quoted as saying that the panel asked Iran’s judiciary two months ago to reject proposals for a possible prisoner exchange until Rezaian faced trial. “Americans made efforts for his release, but did not succeed,” Karimi-Qoddusi said without offering details, according to the Fars report. U.S. officials have not made any direct comments on possible overtures on swaps, but they have repeatedly denounced the trial and have demanded Rezaian’s release and that of at least two other Americans held in Iranian custody. Although the charges against Rezaian have never been officially disclosed or explained publicly, his attorney, Leila Ahsan, said in April that he faced four charges, the most serious of which was espionage. Last week, the Revolutionary Court spokesman, Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, said Rezaian was convicted in a decision that was not made public until weeks after his trial ended. The judge who heard the case, Abolghassem Salavati, is known for handing down harsh sentences. Depending on the particular charges in Rezaian’s conviction, he could face as much as 10 to 20 years, according to Iranian media reports. It is unclear when the sentence could be announced. The Fars report includes claims by Karimi-Qoddusi that Rezaian “confessed” to having links with U.S. officials and Iranian protesters who joined mass demonstrations after the disputed reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009. But Post lawyers say Rezaian has never confessed to any crime, and Ahsan has repeatedly asserted his innocence. The lawmaker also alleged that Rezaian had contacts with a Foreign Ministry source who “provided him with all updates about the [nuclear] negotiating team.” But he did not explain how such contacts would constitute a crime, and there is nothing to indicate that Rezaian had unlawful access to protected information. Some hard-liners opposed the nuclear deal’s provisions as too great a concession. Under the pact, world powers agreed to ease sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on Tehran’s nuclear program. On Tuesday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, endorsed the deal, effectively silencing the dissenters. The Post and international media groups say Rezaian acted only as a journalist. “These are simply the latest false, ridiculous and unsubstantiated claims being circulated by hard-line members of Iran’s parliament,” said Douglas Jehl, The Post’s foreign editor. “The absurd allegations against Jason have shifted endlessly over many months. Now we have a fresh batch. The only thing missing now — and all along — has been actual evidence,” Jehl added. “Jason is innocent, and his treatment has been abhorrent. Jason needs at long last to be given back his freedom.” On Thursday, a reformist newspaper, Aftab-e Yazd, hit back at the claims in the Fars report in a further sign of the internal feuds. The newspaper quoted several parliament members as characterizing hard-liners as trying to use Rezaian’s case to discredit Rouhani and his inner circle, including the chief negotiator of the nuclear deal, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Hadi Shooshtari, also a member of the security and foreign policy committee in parliament, was quoted as saying he was “absolutely unaware” of any ties between Rezaian and Rouhani’s government. “Neither do I recall this issue being discussed at the committee with such details,” he said. Another lawmaker, Ebrahim Nekou, cast the claims against Rezaian as attempts at “political gains” by Rouhani’s opponents. Nekou accused hard-liners of trying to “launch a new scenario” after suffering a defeat over the nuclear deal. “After the government’s achievements on the international scene, the case of Jason Rezaian is raised to challenge the government,” Nekou said, according to Aftab-e Yazd. He dismissed the hard-liners’ assertions that Rezaian had “cozied up to the government,” calling the claims “ridiculous,” the paper said.

0,"A Lebanese-born technology expert whose group has a Washington branch has been arrested in Iran and accused of links to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, Iranian state TV reported Tuesday. The announcement was the first word from Iran on Nizar Ahmad Zakka, whose colleagues said he did not board a scheduled flight from Tehran on Sept. 18 after attending a conference. The reported arrest is the latest in recent weeks to target a visitor with U.S. ties. A Dubai-based businessman with dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, Siamak Namazi, was detained in early October on charges that have not been made public, according to a family member. The Arab ICT Organization, also known as IJMA3, where Zakka serves as secretary general, said in a statement Monday that Zakka was in Tehran at the invitation of the Iranian government to attend a conference on “women and sustainable development.” It said Zakka, 49, last made contact before leaving his hotel for Tehran’s airport to board a flight to Beirut. Iran’s state-run IRIB channel provided no specifics about the allegations against Zakka but quoted an unnamed official as saying that Zakka “has deep ties to the U.S. intelligence and military establishment,” the Reuters news agency reported. Zakka’s organization, an information and communications technology group that has offices in Lebanon, Iraq and Washington, did not immediately respond to inquiries seeking comment. His Beirut-based attorney, Antoine Abu Dib, said Zakka is not an American citizen but spends much of his time in the United States. Abu Dib declined to give details, pending a statement from Zakka’s family. He said he had no official information on Zakka’s reported arrest or whereabouts. Zakka’s Internet profile said he is based in Washington. IJMA3 said it seeks to promote and develop Web-based technology and access across the Middle East and North Africa. Iran holds at least three other Americans, including Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian , who was convicted last month on espionage and other charges after a closed-door trial. Rezaian’s family and attorney strongly deny the charges. Others in custody are retired Marine Amir Hekmati of Flint, Mich., who was accused of being a spy when he went to Iran to visit his grandmother and has been held since 2011; and Saeed Abedini, a pastor from Boise, Idaho, who was convicted in 2013 of threatening Iran’s national security by participating in home churches. Both deny the charges. Hugh Naylor and Suzan Haidamous in Beirut and Craig Whitlock in Washington contributed to this report.

0,"WE’VE ARGUED that the unjust arrest, secret trial and prolonged imprisonment in Iran of The Post’s Jason Rezaian raises the question of whether any Western company considering investment in the country can safely dispatch its personnel there. Now the danger has been underlined. In recent days the arrests of two businessmen visiting Iran — both with connections to the United States — have come to light. Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese information technology specialist and permanent U.S. resident, disappeared on Sept. 18 while attending a government-sponsored conference in Tehran. About a month later, Siamak Namazi, a Dubai-based oil industry consultant with dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, was arrested while visiting a friend in Tehran. That makes four Iranian Americans imprisoned by the regime, plus Mr. Zakka; a fifth American, retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, has been missing since disappearing on a 2007 trip to the country. None has been shown to be guilty of any crime — much less the extravagant and ridiculous charges of espionage that, in the case of Mr. Rezaian, have been reported in the Iranian media. On Tuesday, Iranian television broadcast a photograph of Mr. Zakka in uniform to back up its claim that he worked for U.S. military and intelligence agencies. It turned out the photo came from a reunion at his military high school in Georgia. Mssrs. Zakka and Namazi reportedly were seized by the intelligence service of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the state-within-a-state that operates beyond the control of the government of President Hassan Rouhani. Mr. Rouhani is hoping to revive Iran’s economy with Western investment in the wake of the recently concluded deal on Iran’s nuclear program. But that opening would threaten the ideological principles — and, more importantly, the corrupt business interests — of the IRGC leadership. The Wall Street Journal reported that Iranian businessmen associated with foreign companies had recently been detained and warned not to infringe on the monopolies enjoyed by the scores of companies controlled by the IRGC. That also could explain the arrests of the two businessmen. Mr. Namazi, a veteran of the Iranian oil business, has been a public advocate of improved relations between Iran and the West, while Mr. Zakka, who was based in Washington, was affiliated with a company that promotes Internet development around the Middle East. President Obama has frequently suggested that the nuclear deal would prompt a relaxation of barriers between Iran and the West. So far, the opposite appears to be happening. While anticipating the collection of up to $100 billion in frozen assets, Iran’s military and security services are acting to ensure that there is no further detente. In that they have the support of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who on Tuesday celebrated the anniversary of the seizing of hostages at the U.S. Embassy by proclaiming that the slogan “death to America” will live forever. The Obama administration has reacted to these provocations, including the new arrests, with the equivalent of a shrug. When asked about them, a State Department spokeswoman said, “This is something that we continue to have dialogue on.” Republicans, including House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Edward R.

0,"At the heart of President Obama’s foreign policy is a long bet: that American engagement with previously shunned regimes will, over time, lead to their liberalization, without the need for either a messy domestic revolution or a bloody U.S. use of force. By definition, it will be years before we know whether the policy works. It nevertheless is becoming clear that the regimes on which Obama has lavished attention have greeted his overtures with a counter-strategy. It’s possible, they calculate, to use the economic benefits of better relations to entrench their authoritarian systems for the long term, while screening out any liberalizing influence. Rather than being subverted by U.S. dollars, they would be saved by them. So far, the dictators’ bet is paying off. The latest evidence of that came Sunday in Burma, when the generals who still rule the country staged an election carefully structured to preserve their power. The constitution under which it was held bans opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from becoming president and reserves a quarter of parliamentary seats for the military. Obama might claim that the lifting of U.S. sanctions and the two trips he made to the country helped prompt this limited democratic opening. The generals see it another way: The restricted system, and the inflow of U.S. and European investment it enables, makes their political supremacy sustainable for the long term. As proof, they can point to the fact that they rebuffed U.S. appeals for constitutional reforms before the election with no consequence for the new economic relationship. That Iran’s supreme leader is pursuing a similar course became clear in recent days as the arrests of two businessmen with U.S. citizenship or residency came to light. Having allowed reformist president Hassan Rouhani to negotiate the nuclear deal with Obama, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard intend to pocket the $100 billion or so in proceeds while forcibly preventing what they call the “penetration” of Western influence that Obama hopes for. Hence the taking of more U.S. hostages. To the imprisonment of The Post’s Jason Rezaian and two other Iranian Americans, add Nizar Zakka, a U.S.-based Internet specialist, and Siamak Namazi, an Iranian American who has publicly advocated for better relations between the countries. The lack of any U.S. response means that the open season on Americans will continue in Tehran. Khamenei, however, doesn’t get the prize for the best jujitsu on Obama. That goes to Raú l Castro, the 84-year-old ruler of weak and impoverished Cuba, who has managed to transform the resumption of U.S.-Cuban relations into an almost entirely one-sided transaction. Since announcing the end of the 50-year freeze between the countries 11 months ago, Obama has twice loosened restrictions on U.S. travel and investment in Cuba. Thanks to that, tourism arrivals are up 18 percent this year, and billions in fresh hard currency are flowing into the regime’s nearly empty treasury. The White House has dispatched a stream of senior officials to Havana, including Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. The deputy secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas, last month paid court to the general who heads Castro’s repressive internal security apparatus. In response to this, Castro has done virtually nothing, other than reopen the Cuban Embassy in Washington and allow a cellphone roaming agreement . His answer to repeated pleadings from U.S. officials for gestures on human rights has been to step up repression of the opposition. According to the independent Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, there were at least 1,093 political detentions in October, the highest number in 16 months. Castro has meanwhile shunned offers from U.S. businesses and dramatically cut U.S. imports. Pritzker did not sign a single deal during her high-profile visit last month. Instead, Cuban officials are using the prospect of increased U.S. trade and investment as “chum” to strike bargains with other countries, according to a report by the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. While imports of U.S. food are down 44 percent this year, imports from China are up 76 percent. Remarkably, the administration appears happy to accept this. The latest high-level envoy, State Department senior adviser David Thorne, told Reuters in Havana last week: “The pace is really going to be set by the Cubans, and we are satisfied with how they want to do this.” What about the lack of progress on human rights? “As in other parts of the world,” Thorne grandly replied, “we are really trying to also say: Let’s find out how we can work together and not always say that human rights are the first things we have to fix before anything else.” So the message is: It’s okay to capture U.S. dollars while excluding U.S. business and cracking down on anyone favoring liberalization.

By definition, it will be years before we know whether the policy works. It nevertheless is becoming clear that the regimes on which Obama has lavished attention have greeted his overtures with a counter-strategy. It’s possible, they calculate, to use the economic benefits of better relations to entrench their authoritarian systems for the long term, while screening out any liberalizing influence. Rather than being subverted by U.S. dollars, they would be saved by them. So far, the dictators’ bet is paying off. The latest evidence of that came Sunday in Burma, when the generals who still rule the country staged an election carefully structured to preserve their power. The constitution under which it was held bans opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from becoming president and reserves a quarter of parliamentary seats for the military. Obama might claim that the lifting of U.S. sanctions and the two trips he made to the country helped prompt this limited democratic opening. The generals see it another way: The restricted system, and the inflow of U.S. and European investment it enables, makes their political supremacy sustainable for the long term. As proof, they can point to the fact that they rebuffed U.S. appeals for constitutional reforms before the election with no consequence for the new economic relationship. That Iran’s supreme leader is pursuing a similar course became clear in recent days as the arrests of two businessmen with U.S. citizenship or residency came to light. Having allowed reformist president Hassan Rouhani to negotiate the nuclear deal with Obama, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard intend to pocket the $100 billion or so in proceeds while forcibly preventing what they call the “penetration” of Western influence that Obama hopes for. Hence the taking of more U.S. hostages. To the imprisonment of The Post’s Jason Rezaian and two other Iranian Americans, add Nizar Zakka, a U.S.-based Internet specialist, and Siamak Namazi, an Iranian American who has publicly advocated for better relations between the countries. The lack of any U.S. response means that the open season on Americans will continue in Tehran. Khamenei, however, doesn’t get the prize for the best jujitsu on Obama. That goes to Raú l Castro, the 84-year-old ruler of weak and impoverished Cuba, who has managed to transform the resumption of U.S.-Cuban relations into an almost entirely one-sided transaction. Since announcing the end of the 50-year freeze between the countries 11 months ago, Obama has twice loosened restrictions on U.S. travel and investment in Cuba. Thanks to that, tourism arrivals are up 18 percent this year, and billions in fresh hard currency are flowing into the regime’s nearly empty treasury.

0,"ROME — Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country will raise the case of detained Washington Post Tehran correspondent Jason Rezaian during Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s visit to Rome on Saturday, saying a resolution of the matter would help build confidence in the wake of Iran’s landmark nuclear deal with world powers. Rezaian has been held for more than a year and was recently convicted of espionage and other charges, though The Post and international media groups say he is innocent and acted solely as a journalist. Iran also recently arrested Dubai-based Iranian American Siamak Namazi, which brought to four the number of Americans with dual citizenship being held there. In a lengthy interview with The Post, Gentiloni said he has already raised the issue of Rezaian’s detention with Iranian officials. The Italians, he said, will again bring up the case with Rouhani, who is making his first trip to Europe as president. Rouhani also will meet with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, with economic cooperation topping the agenda. On a trip being billed as the beginning of Iran’s emergence from economic isolation from the West, Rouhani will also meet with Pope Francis before moving on to a second leg in France. Italian and other European companies are scrambling to court Iran in anticipation of the lifting of international sanctions next year as part of the July accord to limit and strictly monitor Iran’s nuclear program. Gentiloni said that Italy was working on economic agreements with Iran but that they would be contingent on the lifting of sanctions. He said the resolution of outstanding humanitarian issues, including Rezaian’s detention, and Iranian cooperation on Syria, were crucial to building trust. Below are edited excerpts from the interview: Is Rouhani’s trip signaling Iran’s economic coming out? We certainly appreciate the fact that Iran is choosing our country as the first to be visited by President Rouhani after the nuclear deal. And I think this is also connected to the fact that Iran feels toward Italy a relation based on what I would call ancient civilizations, even going back to the relationship between ancient Rome and Persia. The nuclear deal and the opening of economic relations are connected, but it is also very, very well known that if things proceed in the right direction, as we sincerely hope and frankly believe, there will also be a sort of, to be frank, competition within Western economies. We are talking about a market of 80 million people, many of them well educated. If the two pillars of the deal function as they are imagined, we eliminate the threat of a military nuclear-armed Iran and create a framework for new economic relations. I think this could open opportunities in a very relevant market where the Italians have been present since the 1950s. The economic sanctions against Iran affected Italy hard? Yes. Not only Italy. Other European countries, as well. We are now at the first step, and . . . we are not yet even at so-called implementation day. To arrive there, we need the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] to verify a certain number of issues. We know that the process has a very clear track, and the visit of President Rouhani will be an opportunity to start to consolidate our economic and cultural cooperation. But implementation is connected to their progress. What are the potential sticking points? I think what is at stake is mostly political, rather than connected to technical details. In Iran, we know they have elections next February and the public debate could be dominated by two connected issues. One is economics, and the other, relations with the West and the United States. So I think that the problem is not this or that or another technical element connected to the IAEA, but that the political will of the leaders who decided this deal in Vienna remains on track.  What could help keep things on track? Obviously, there is something that could help to build more confidence. The minimum necessary is to respect what was signed, and that depends on political will. But apart from this, there is something else that could help build confidence and facilitate relations between the U.S. and Iran, or even between Iran, the U.S. and Europe. One issue is the situation concerning a certain number of American citizens. Your colleague Rezaian] and another two or three U.S. citizens. A solution of this issue could be not only a step in the right direction from a humanitarian point of view, but a contribution toward facilitating the whole process. If possible, European countries — Italy, as far as we are concerned — could try to help to not only raise this issue, but to try and find solutions. Will Italy raise Jason’s case with the Iranians this weekend? For sure. And we have already raised it before. We are raising these issues not to create a scandal but to try to make a contribution toward solving the problem. A solution not only for humanitarian reasons, but to create the right atmosphere. Another issue that could help is the potential of what is happening this Saturday in Vienna, where we will have the second round of negotiations on Syria. Will you be asking the Iranians to cooperate more on Syria? I think the Iranians could accept the idea that there is a possible transition, with an opening to a different governance from the one that we now have, and, at a certain point, arrive not at regime change, but to the fact that Bashar al-Assad is not the one in charge. They are not accepting this idea, but I hope for a compromise in the next negotiations. How do you interpret the recent signs that hard-liners in Iran are toughening their stance at home? I am not in a position to be accurate on news analysis. But what I firmly believe is that Iranian President Rouhani and the government have committed themselves to a process. I don’t think this process is about changing the principles of the Islamic republic, but it is about accepting a certain path of opening in the political and economic fields. This is what, from our point of view, is crucial. Isn’t there a chance that the hard-liners will simply reestablish themselves more strongly if there is less pressure on the Iranian economy?  I think we should bet against this question. What we are certain of is that the mechanism of the agreement on the nuclear program allows us to know, to be informed, to be aware if the agreement is not implemented. We will know it. We will have information. But my firm belief knowing the complexity of Iranian society is that the more we go on track with the agreement, the more we build economic ties, the more this will also help to stabilize Iran. You’ve used the word “gradual.” What’s your time line for a green light for investment? If the conditions are verified by the IAEA, it could begin for sure early next year. . . .The reality is that already I have visited Iran with many Italian companies, and similar efforts were made by many Western countries. This is to prepare for a potential future relationship, but with a clear connection to the fact that this future depends on the progress of the deal. And the Iranians are fully aware of this. You’ve been to Iran twice this year. What’s the atmosphere there like? There is a great expectation of the fact that the deal can create new opportunities. . . . For sure, there is a sympathy for Italians. It is not only an Iranian characteristic. Italy has no hidden agenda. They know this. Italy has no colonial past in Iran. We had no significant quarrels with them in the last 30 years. They know very well that we are allied with NATO and the U.S. This is something Iranians are perfectly aware of, but it cannot erase a feeling of closeness and mutual understanding. This deal has been very controversial, especially among some Republicans in the United States. How could that affect it? I think that the deal is totally acceptable because on one side you kill a military threat and on the other side you open an economic window. Obviously, if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. But if it doesn’t work, we will know. And the mechanism is there to make us aware of that fact if it doesn’t work. I would say that I respect the discussion in the United States, but I am very happy that at the end, the position of President Obama supporting the deal was accepted. I know some say that with a stronger economy the Iranians will be more threatening. But I think with a stronger economy, they will be more interested in relations with their partners.  The Saudis recently expressed their concerns to Italy about the deal? Yes. How do you envision Iran’s economy two or three years from now? Will Italy and other European countries be responsible for the modernization of the Iranian economy? The Iranian market will never again be for Europe the same as it was before. In the last years, China arrived there and other countries, too, and they are very competitive countries. But we know that Western know-how and capabilities and technology is something very strong. What agreement will be reached this weekend? We will see, because, as always, things are finalized in the last days. What should be clear is that they will be obviously submitted to these safeguard clauses, as was mentioned. There are two different aspects. There are some issues concerning the past. There have been negotiations between the Iranian oil company and [the Italian energy giant] ENI over some claims arising from previous contracts. The sanctions regime authorized ENI to be paid in oil. Not money but oil . . . and there could be some sort of memorandum concerning future relations.

0,"A prominent Iranian recently blasted the symbiotic relationship between state media and security forces, saying he can tell by reading the critical stories who is about to be arrested. That disgruntled Iranian was not some activist for press freedom but Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani. His unusual critique in a speech broadcast on state television last weekend demonstrates how much conflict within the Iranian government has spilled into the open in the wake of the country’s nuclear deal with the United States and five other world powers. Rouhani, a pragmatist, has repeatedly pushed back against a crackdown underway from isolationist hard-liners who control the judiciary and intelligence branches and who are working to undermine the nuclear deal. The hard-liners are signaling that Rouhani’s attempts to reestablish Iran’s place in the world can go only so far. Whichever side prevails in parliamentary elections scheduled for late February could determine the path Iran will take for years to come. For now, the crackdown will shadow Rouhani as he visits Italy and France this weekend to drum up trade deals. He is likely to face questions about the arrests of many journalists, activists, intellectuals, dual citizens of Iran and the United States, and even poets accused of “undermining” the Islamic republic. Many analysts say the flood of arrests was an inevitable consequence of the July agreement, in which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear capacity in exchange for relief from sanctions. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, backed the negotiations, but since the deal, he has repeatedly warned against “infiltrators” from the United States and Europe. The crackdown is one way to block any warming of relations between Iran and the United States, a country the hard-liners still call the Great Satan. “Ayatollah Khamenei wanted the agreement, but he didn’t want an opening,” said Ray Takeyh, a fellow in Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “He was concerned about the cultural infiltration that accompanies any potential opening. One way to protect the system and ideology would be to have a crackdown.” For many Iranians, the nuclear deal was never just about centrifuges and uranium stockpiles, which under the agreement will be reduced and monitored to prevent Tehran from getting enough material to build a nuclear weapon. It wasn’t even about lifting the yoke of sanctions. The negotiations were more about what kind of country Iran will be — isolated and pure, with a “resistance economy,” or more open to outside goods and the inevitable cultural changes they will bring. “For Iran’s deep state, the nuclear deal was merely a tactical, temporary compromise, not a strategic reorientation,” said Karim Sadjadpour, a policy analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Khamenei has seemingly given a carte blanche to Iran’s repressive apparatus to aggressively counter any political, social and economic change agents.” On Sept. 16, two months after the deal was finalized, Khamenei gave a speech to commanders of the Revolutionary Guard Corps in which he urged their intelligence organization to counter an “infiltration plot” concocted by Washington. “Economic and security infiltration is obviously dangerous and can have serious consequences, but political and cultural infiltration by the enemy is a much more dangerous issue,” he said. His remarks effectively were a thumbs-up to the Revolutionary Guard and the judiciary to steam ahead, weakening Rouhani and squashing anyone who might be an agent of reform — moderate journalists or Iranian American businessmen who could serve as intermediaries, for example, as well as Rouhani and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated the deal. “Conservatives and the IRGC forces who were not happy with the nuclear deal were waiting for an opportunity to go beyond just criticizing the deal, to embarrass Rouhani and Zarif and undermine the president,” said Haleh Esfandiari, a scholar with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Within days of Khamenei’s speech, a dozen members of parliament wrote a letter to the Ministries of Intelligence and of Culture and Islamic Guidance warning that Iran had been infiltrated by reformist media and “hundreds” of Western spies. The security and judicial forces have been operating at a clipped pace ever since. In mid-October, Iran’s judiciary announced that a guilty verdict had been reached in the purported espionage case of imprisoned Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, who has been detained since July 2014 and was tried in closed-door court. His family and senior editors at The Post have asserted that Rezaian is innocent and called the secret proceedings a “sham” trial. On Friday, Rezaian’s brother Ali released a statement urging European leaders who meet with Rouhani to advocate for the Post reporter’s release from prison. Shortly after Rezaian’s conviction, security agents arrested Iranian American businessman Siamak Namazi, a consultant based in Dubai who makes frequent trips to Iran. They also detained Nizar Ahmad Zakka, a Lebanese information-technology specialist who is a permanent resident in the United States. In early November, the commander of the Revolutionary Guard called the period after the nuclear deal a “fourth sedition,” following in the footsteps of the “seditions” that prompted crackdowns after the Iran-Iraq War, student uprisings in 1999 and post-election protests in 2009. In recent weeks, at least five Iranian journalists have been taken into custody, all of them representing what are considered reformist-oriented news or social-media outlets. According to Hadi Ghaemi, head of the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, many other Iranian journalists have been harassed and threatened by security agents. Crackdowns have taken place in Iran before, most recently ahead of the 2012 elections, which ushered in a hard-line parliament that has impeded Rouhani’s ability to get more moderate legislation passed. “They’re sending the same message” as in previous crackdowns, said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. “The Islamic republic isn’t going anywhere. The ideology won’t be modulated by this particular diplomatic agreement, and anyone who dabbles in building bridges — to the United States in particular — is at risk.” The parliamentary elections on Feb. 26 will be particularly crucial, at least if reformist contenders are not disqualified by the Guardian Council, which vets candidates. Not only will the elections demonstrate how Iranians feel about the openings stemming from the nuclear deal, they will also determine who sits on the Assembly of Experts. That is the panel that could be called on to pick a successor to the 76-year-old Khamenei, who reportedly underwent an operation for prostate cancer last year. That helps explain why Rouhani made a pitch for press freedom in his Nov. 8 speech, calling for media regulations that would shield journalists from a crackdown. “Transparent regulations will stop certain people picking up on a word or a sentence in a media outlet and putting their freedom at risk,” he said. And in a video he posted on his Instagram page Nov. 4, Rouhani suggested that the crackdown was related to the upcoming elections. “We should not senselessly go after one person or two people and take them from here or there, and say this is linked to infiltration and make this a big case in the country,” he said. He also pushed back on how the word “infiltration” is frequently aimed at political opponents. “We have to fight in a serious and real way any type of foreign infiltration, and a few should not toy with the word,” he said. Ghaemi said it is too soon to tell whether Rouhani’s back talk represents a turning point. “But after the deal, with the approaching February election, he wants to make sure the environment doesn’t close down completely, and he’s helpless in having mass communication channels,” he said. “Rouhani can’t work with this parliament. It’s gridlock.” Read more: 13 charts and maps that make the Iran deal a little easier to understand Historic deal reached with Iran to limit nuclear program A timeline of the Jason Rezaian case Full coverage on Post correspondent Jason Rezaian","A prominent Iranian recently blasted the symbiotic relationship between state media and security forces, saying he can tell by reading the critical stories who is about to be arrested.

One way to protect the system and ideology would be to have a crackdown.” For many Iranians, the nuclear deal was never just about centrifuges and uranium stockpiles, which under the agreement will be reduced and monitored to prevent Tehran from getting enough material to build a nuclear weapon. It wasn’t even about lifting the yoke of sanctions. The negotiations were more about what kind of country Iran will be — isolated and pure, with a “resistance economy,” or more open to outside goods and the inevitable cultural changes they will bring. “For Iran’s deep state, the nuclear deal was merely a tactical, temporary compromise, not a strategic reorientation,” said Karim Sadjadpour, a policy analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Khamenei has seemingly given a carte blanche to Iran’s repressive apparatus to aggressively counter any political, social and economic change agents.” On Sept. 16, two months after the deal was finalized, Khamenei gave a speech to commanders of the Revolutionary Guard Corps in which he urged their intelligence organization to counter an “infiltration plot” concocted by Washington. “Economic and security infiltration is obviously dangerous and can have serious consequences, but political and cultural infiltration by the enemy is a much more dangerous issue,” he said. His remarks effectively were a thumbs-up to the Revolutionary Guard and the judiciary to steam ahead, weakening Rouhani and squashing anyone who might be an agent of reform — moderate journalists or Iranian American businessmen who could serve as intermediaries, for example, as well as Rouhani and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated the deal. “Conservatives and the IRGC forces who were not happy with the nuclear deal were waiting for an opportunity to go beyond just criticizing the deal, to embarrass Rouhani and Zarif and undermine the president,” said Haleh Esfandiari, a scholar with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Within days of Khamenei’s speech, a dozen members of parliament wrote a letter to the Ministries of Intelligence and of Culture and Islamic Guidance warning that Iran had been infiltrated by reformist media and “hundreds” of Western spies. The security and judicial forces have been operating at a clipped pace ever since. In mid-October, Iran’s judiciary announced that a guilty verdict had been reached in the purported espionage case of imprisoned Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, who has been detained since July 2014 and was tried in closed-door court. His family and senior editors at The Post have asserted that Rezaian is innocent and called the secret proceedings a “sham” trial. On Friday, Rezaian’s brother Ali released a statement urging European leaders who meet with Rouhani to advocate for the Post reporter’s release from prison. Shortly after Rezaian’s conviction, security agents arrested Iranian American businessman Siamak Namazi, a consultant based in Dubai who makes frequent trips to Iran. They also detained Nizar Ahmad Zakka, a Lebanese information-technology specialist who is a permanent resident in the United States. In early November, the commander of the Revolutionary Guard called the period after the nuclear deal a “fourth sedition,” following in the footsteps of the “seditions” that prompted crackdowns after the Iran-Iraq War, student uprisings in 1999 and post-election protests in 2009. In recent weeks, at least five Iranian journalists have been taken into custody, all of them representing what are considered reformist-oriented news or social-media outlets. According to Hadi Ghaemi, head of the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, many other Iranian journalists have been harassed and threatened by security agents. Crackdowns have taken place in Iran before, most recently ahead of the 2012 elections, which ushered in a hard-line parliament that has impeded Rouhani’s ability to get more moderate legislation passed. “They’re sending the same message” as in previous crackdowns, said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. “The Islamic republic isn’t going anywhere. The ideology won’t be modulated by this particular diplomatic agreement, and anyone who dabbles in building bridges — to the United States in particular — is at risk.” The parliamentary elections on Feb. 26 will be particularly crucial, at least if reformist contenders are not disqualified by the Guardian Council, which vets candidates. Not only will the elections demonstrate how Iranians feel about the openings stemming from the nuclear deal, they will also determine who sits on the Assembly of Experts. That is the panel that could be called on to pick a successor to the 76-year-old Khamenei, who reportedly underwent an operation for prostate cancer last year. That helps explain why Rouhani made a pitch for press freedom in his Nov. 8 speech, calling for media regulations that would shield journalists from a crackdown. “Transparent regulations will stop certain people picking up on a word or a sentence in a media outlet and putting their freedom at risk,” he said. And in a video he posted on his Instagram page Nov. 4, Rouhani suggested that the crackdown was related to the upcoming elections. “We should not senselessly go after one person or two people and take them from here or there, and say this is linked to infiltration and make this a big case in the country,” he said. He also pushed back on how the word “infiltration” is frequently aimed at political opponents. “We have to fight in a serious and real way any type of foreign infiltration, and a few should not toy with the word,” he said. Ghaemi said it is too soon to tell whether Rouhani’s back talk represents a turning point. “But after the deal, with the approaching February election, he wants to make sure the environment doesn’t close down completely, and he’s helpless in having mass communication channels,” he said. “Rouhani can’t work with this parliament. It’s gridlock.” Read more: 13 charts and maps that make the Iran deal a little easier to understand Historic deal reached with Iran to limit nuclear program A timeline of the Jason Rezaian case Full coverage on Post correspondent Jason Rezaian"
0,"Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who has been held by the government of Iran for the past 16 months and was convicted on unspecified charges last month, has been sentenced to a prison term, the state news agency announced Sunday. Rezaian faced four charges, including espionage, according to his lawyer. But in announcing a conviction in October, Iranian authorities did not provide any details of the verdict. Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, a spokesman for Iran’s judiciary, confirmed the punishment in a statement posted on the official Islamic Republic News Agency’s Web site, according to the Associated Press. He did not say how long the prison term would be. “The verdict has been issued but has not been officially handed down to the accused or his lawyer,” Mohseni-Ejei said. “Given the fact that the verdict has not been officially handed down, I cannot reveal the details, but what I can say is that the accused has been sentenced to prison.” Referring to the possibility of an appeal, Mohseni-Ejei noted that the verdict was “not finalized,” the AP reported. Since Rezaian’s arrest, The Post has maintained that he is innocent and called for his immediate release. “We’re aware of the reports in the Iranian media but have no further information at this time,” said Douglas Jehl, The Post’s foreign editor. “Every day that Jason is in prison is an injustice. He has done nothing wrong. “Even after keeping Jason in prison 488 days so far, Iran has produced no evidence of wrongdoing,” Jehl added. “His trial and sentence are a sham, and he should be released immediately.” State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the government is aware of the sentence and called for Rezaian’s release. “We’ve seen the reports of a sentence in the case of U.S. citizen Jason Rezaian in Iran but cannot confirm the details ourselves at this time,” Kirby said. “If true, we call on the Iranian authorities to vacate this sentence and immediately free Jason so that he can be returned to his family.” Rezaian — who grew up in Marin County, Calif., and has dual American and Iranian citizenship — has been held in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison since his arrest on July 22 last year. He had been working as The Post’s Tehran correspondent since 2012. Rezaian was arrested with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and a photographer, both of whom were eventually released on bail. Rezaian’s lawyer, Leila Ahsan, told the Associated Press that she was not made aware of the verdict or any details surrounding the sentence. “I have no information about details of the verdict,” she said. “We were expecting the verdict some three months ago.” An indictment cited by Iran’s state media calls Rezaian an “American spy” and accuses him of gathering information about individuals and companies inside the country. The indictment also accuses him of leaking information to the U.S. government. His brother, Ali Rezaian, issued a statement Sunday that said, in part, “The Iranian judicial process around Jason’s case has been profoundly flawed from the outset. The confusion and lack of transparency throughout these proceedings has only made this situation more difficult for Jason and our family. My brother is an innocent man and a well-respected journalist. As our family gathers for Thanksgiving, we remain hopeful that Jason will soon be reunited with us.” Carol Morello in Boston contributed to this report.","Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who has been held by the government of Iran for the past 16 months and was convicted on unspecified charges last month, has been sentenced to a prison term, the state news agency announced Sunday.

0,"THE FRAUDULENCE of Iran’s prosecution of The Post’s Jason Rezaian is perfectly captured by the public statements of Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, the first deputy chief justice of the judiciary, who frequently holds news conferences in Tehran. Last July, Mr. Mohseni-Ejei was asked about the status of Mr. Rezaian’s trial, which was being held behind closed doors. “The trial will continue and when the verdict is issued we will announce it to people,” he said. Mr. Rezaian’s trial apparently ended Aug. 10. But to this day, no official verdict has been announced or communicated even to the U.S. journalist’s lawyer. Nor has a sentence been made public. Instead, Mr. Rezaian’s family has had to contend with confusing and contradictory statements by Mr. Mohseni-Ejei and other officials, which together demonstrate that nothing resembling a legitimate process — even under Iran’s laws — has taken place. For example, on Aug. 9, the day before Mr. Rezaian’s final known court appearance, the semiofficial Iranian Students’ News Agency (ISNA) quoted Mr. Mohseni-Ejei as saying that “this person has already been sentenced, but I don’t know the details of the verdict.” Six days later, he changed his story: The same news agency quoted Mr. Mohseni-Ejei as saying the court was still waiting for a written plea from Mr. Rezaian’s attorney. “I’m not allowed to give any details, but I assume that a judgment will be issued at the end of this week or next,” he said. Meanwhile, another judicial official, Gholam Hossein Esmaeili, was quoted the same day by the same agency as saying that no verdict was expected anytime soon. On Aug. 30, Mr. Mohseni-Ejei offered a third account: He didn’t know whether a verdict in the Rezaian case had been reached. “But the final session took place two weeks ago,” he offered. On Oct. 11, Mr. Mohseni-Ejei told reporters that a verdict had been “issued” but didn’t say what it was. Other Iranian reports said Mr. Rezaian had been convicted on charges of espionage. That, however, wasn’t the end of it. On Nov. 3, ISNA spoke again to Mr. Esmaeili, who said the case was not completed, and that a new hearing was scheduled for Nov. 16. “This case is still in court and the judiciary’s spokesman” — that would presumably be Mr. Mohseni-Ejei — “will make an announcement once it has come to a conclusion,” Mr. Esmaeili was quoted as saying. Nov. 16 came and went. But on Sunday, Mr. Mohseni-Ejei once again said that Mr. Rezaian had been “sentenced to prison ,” the same account he had offered on Aug. 9. He added that the verdict “has not officially been handed down” and was “not finalized.” Meanwhile, Mr. Rezaian’s lawyer, Leila Ahsan, told the Associated Press she had not been informed about a verdict or a sentence. What could explain this welter of misinformation? Possibly Mr. Rezaian is being dangled by the regime as bait for a prisoner exchange. Maybe he is a pawn in a power struggle between the hard-line judiciary and the government of President Hassan Rouhani. We don’t pretend to know.

He is held in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison, where political prisoners are kept; his principal companion is a cellmate who speaks neither English nor Persian, making communication difficult. Mr. Rezaian is no longer allowed contact with his lawyer nor fresh supplies of reading material. His exercise time was cut back after Iran finished negotiating its nuclear deal with a U.S.-led coalition over the summer. Though his trial on espionage charges ended Aug. 10, neither he nor his lawyer has been formally informed of the verdict or sentence against him. This outrage will have continued for 56 days longer than the hostage crisis of 1979-81, when 52 Americans were held captive at the U.S. Embassy. Though Iran has previously arrested journalists with foreign citizenship, Mr. Rezaian has been held far longer than any of them. His wife, Yeganeh Salehi, an Iranian citizen, also remains in limbo: Arrested with Mr. Rezaian on July 22, 2014, at their home, she was released after two months but has not been allowed to return to her work as a journalist and remains under threat of prosecution. The couple are allowed to meet every other Saturday for an hour, and Mr. Rezaian is also allowed a weekly meeting with Ms. Salehi and his mother. Otherwise, he is subjected to a cruel isolation. It has been widely speculated that Mr. Rezaian is a pawn in an internal Iranian power struggle. Hard-liners are said to be using him, and at least three other Americans they are holding, to block any further improvement in relations between the United States and the government of Hassan Rouhani.

Mr. Zarif has gone from describing him as a “friend” and “good reporter” to suggesting he might be guilty of wrongdoing, while Mr. Rouhani floated the idea that he should be traded for 19 Iranians being held in the United States. What seems clear is that the Obama administration has failed to create incentives for the regime to release Mr. Rezaian and other Americans. It continues to implement the nuclear deal; in a change of policy, it invited Iran to participate in political talks on Syria.

0,"The Washington Post and other supporters of journalist Jason Rezaian on Wednesday amplified demands for his release from Iranian custody, a day before the reporter marks 500 days since his arrest and subsequent closed-door trial on charges that included espionage. The new pressures, including updated filings by The Post with a U.N. panel, seek to boost international leverage on Iran after the reported conviction and sentencing of Rezaian, The Post’s correspondent in Tehran. The case has drawn widespread outrage from media-freedom groups and sharp criticism from senior Obama administration officials and U.S. lawmakers. The Post, meanwhile, has strongly denied any wrongdoing by Rezaian and has called the detention “cruel and arbitrary” treatment of a journalist who never strayed beyond the normal work of news gathering. “This isn’t a real case,” said David W. Bowker, an attorney at the firm of WilmerHale who is representing The Post, “but rather a case of political theater.” Iran, however, has not publicly clarified the allegations against Rezaian during sessions in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court, which barred his family and others from attending. Last month, Iranian state media reported that Rezaian — a dual Iranian American citizen — had been sentenced to a prison term after his apparent conviction in October but gave no other details. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, called the 500-day mark in Rezaian’s detention “the grimmest” of milestones — 56 days longer than the hostages held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran after the 1979 Islamic revolution. “Five hundred days robbed of his life, 500 days deprived of his family, 500 days denied any semblance of justice,” Baron said in a statement. “Jason has done nothing wrong,” he added. “Iran has never even bothered to produce any evidence against him. His so-called trial was a sham. Recent announcements, without details, of his supposed ‘conviction’ and ‘sentencing’ have only added new layers of cruelty.” The Post has filed a supplementary petition with the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, expanding on a July filing calling for Rezaian’s immediate release and appealing to the world body to intervene. The new documents, made public by The Post on Wednesday, list an array of concerns including the deteriorating heath of the 39-year-old Rezaian, who suffers from high blood pressure and other ailments as “Iran’s mistreatment of him has intensified.” The filing further outlines many failings in Rezaian’s trial, including lack of openness on the charges, barring Rezaian’s lawyer from examining evidence and witnesses, and the murky outcome of “farcical legal proceedings.” Rezaian’s attorney, Leila Ahsan, is prohibited from discussing the case with media outside Iran. The Post’s supplementary documents, filed with the United Nations on Nov. 25, also touch on speculation that Rezaian has become caught in a power struggle between Iranian hard-liners controlling the judiciary and reform-minded opponents including the government of President Hassan Rouhani. Such battles have flared for years on a range of disputes — most recently over the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers including the United States. There has been no clear declaration of an internal feud over Rezaian. But Iranian media on both sides have published contrasting narratives on the Rezaian case, including whether Iran is possibly seeking a swap of Rezaian for Iranians held in U.S. custody. Post attorney Bowker said he expects an advisory opinion from the U.N. group that could increase calls for Rezaian’s release. “Iran needs to hear the world’s outrage,” said Douglas Jehl, the foreign editor at The Post. On Thursday, Rezaian’s brother, Ali, plans to deliver a petition to Iran’s permanent mission to the United Nations containing more than 500,000 signatures calling for Rezaian’s “immediate and unconditional release.” He said additional initiatives are needed in tandem with possible diplomatic appeals by Washington, which does not have official relations with Iran but works through Switzerland and other intermediaries. “It’s very frustrating that he remains in jail,” said Ali Rezaian. “Whatever anyone is doing or trying to do, it isn’t working.” Rezaian was arrested July 22, 2014, along with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and two photojournalists. All but Rezaian were eventually released on bail. Salehi, an Iranian, is a correspondent for The National newspaper based in Abu Dhabi. It remains unclear whether Iran will seek to bring the others to trial. Three other American citizens are known to be held by Iran. Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor, has been in Iranian custody since September 2012. He was convicted of security-related charges that include claims of proselytizing. Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine, was detained in August 2011 while on a family visit to Iran. He was convicted in early 2012 on espionage and other charges. A death sentence was reduced to 10 years in prison, according to the family’s Web site. Last month, Siamak Namazi, a Dubai-based businessman, was arrested while visiting relatives in Iran, his family said. Any charges against him are unknown. A former FBI agent and CIA contractor, Robert Levinson, was last seen publicly in March 2007 on the Iranian resort island of Kish, where he was investigating cigarette smuggling on behalf of a client. Iran denies knowledge of Levinson’s whereabouts or any involvement in his disappearance. A video circulated in December 2011 purported to show Levinson but offered no clear indication of his location. Iran denies that it is holding him.

Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, called the 500-day mark in Rezaian’s detention “the grimmest” of milestones — 56 days longer than the hostages held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran after the 1979 Islamic revolution. “Five hundred days robbed of his life, 500 days deprived of his family, 500 days denied any semblance of justice,” Baron said in a statement. “Jason has done nothing wrong,” he added. “Iran has never even bothered to produce any evidence against him. His so-called trial was a sham. Recent announcements, without details, of his supposed ‘conviction’ and ‘sentencing’ have only added new layers of cruelty.” The Post has filed a supplementary petition with the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, expanding on a July filing calling for Rezaian’s immediate release and appealing to the world body to intervene. The new documents, made public by The Post on Wednesday, list an array of concerns including the deteriorating heath of the 39-year-old Rezaian, who suffers from high blood pressure and other ailments as “Iran’s mistreatment of him has intensified.” The filing further outlines many failings in Rezaian’s trial, including lack of openness on the charges, barring Rezaian’s lawyer from examining evidence and witnesses, and the murky outcome of “farcical legal proceedings.” Rezaian’s attorney, Leila Ahsan, is prohibited from discussing the case with media outside Iran. The Post’s supplementary documents, filed with the United Nations on Nov. 25, also touch on speculation that Rezaian has become caught in a power struggle between Iranian hard-liners controlling the judiciary and reform-minded opponents including the government of President Hassan Rouhani. Such battles have flared for years on a range of disputes — most recently over the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers including the United States. There has been no clear declaration of an internal feud over Rezaian. But Iranian media on both sides have published contrasting narratives on the Rezaian case, including whether Iran is possibly seeking a swap of Rezaian for Iranians held in U.S. custody. Post attorney Bowker said he expects an advisory opinion from the U.N. group that could increase calls for Rezaian’s release. “Iran needs to hear the world’s outrage,” said Douglas Jehl, the foreign editor at The Post. On Thursday, Rezaian’s brother, Ali, plans to deliver a petition to Iran’s permanent mission to the United Nations containing more than 500,000 signatures calling for Rezaian’s “immediate and unconditional release.” He said additional initiatives are needed in tandem with possible diplomatic appeals by Washington, which does not have official relations with Iran but works through Switzerland and other intermediaries. “It’s very frustrating that he remains in jail,” said Ali Rezaian. “Whatever anyone is doing or trying to do, it isn’t working.” Rezaian was arrested July 22, 2014, along with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and two photojournalists. All but Rezaian were eventually released on bail. Salehi, an Iranian, is a correspondent for The National newspaper based in Abu Dhabi. It remains unclear whether Iran will seek to bring the others to trial. Three other American citizens are known to be held by Iran. Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor, has been in Iranian custody since September 2012. He was convicted of security-related charges that include claims of proselytizing. Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine, was detained in August 2011 while on a family visit to Iran. He was convicted in early 2012 on espionage and other charges. A death sentence was reduced to 10 years in prison, according to the family’s Web site. Last month, Siamak Namazi, a Dubai-based businessman, was arrested while visiting relatives in Iran, his family said. Any charges against him are unknown. A former FBI agent and CIA contractor, Robert Levinson, was last seen publicly in March 2007 on the Iranian resort island of Kish, where he was investigating cigarette smuggling on behalf of a client. Iran denies knowledge of Levinson’s whereabouts or any involvement in his disappearance. A video circulated in December 2011 purported to show Levinson but offered no clear indication of his location. Iran denies that it is holding him.

0,"IRAN IS following through on the nuclear deal it struck with a U.S.-led coalition in an utterly predictable way: It is racing to fulfill those parts of the accord that will allow it to collect $100 billion in frozen funds and end sanctions on its oil exports and banking system, while expanding its belligerent and illegal activities in other areas — and daring the West to respond. Unfortunately, the Obama administration’s response to these provocations has also been familiar. It is doing its best to downplay them — and thereby encouraging Tehran to press for still-greater advantage. We’ve pointed out how the regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has unjustly sentenced Post correspondent Jason Rezaian to prison and arrested two businessmen with U.S. citizenship or residence since signing the nuclear accord. There have been no penalties for those outrageous violations of human rights. Now a United Nations panel has determined that Iran test-fired a nuclear-capable missile on Oct. 10 with a range of at least 600 miles, in violation of a U.N. resolution that prohibits such launches. Moreover, it appears likely that a second missile launch occurred on Nov. 21, also in violation of Security Council Resolution 1929. The U.S. response? “We are now actively considering the appropriate consequences to that launch in October,” State Department official Stephen Mull testified at a Senate committee hearing Thursday. In other words, there have so far been none — other than a speech by the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations blaming the Security Council for the lack of action. As for the second missile launch, the administration claims to be investigating it, though it likely has in its possession the intelligence necessary to make a judgment. It’s not hard to guess the reasons for this fecklessness. President Obama is reluctant to do anything that might derail the nuclear deal before Iran carries out its commitments, including uninstalling thousands of centrifuges and diluting or removing tons of enriched uranium. The same logic prompted him to tolerate Iran’s malign interventions in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, along with the arrest of Mr. Rezaian, while the pact was under negotiation. U.S. officials argue that Iran’s nonnuclear violations make it all the more important that the nuclear deal be implemented. But that ignores the clear connections between the missile launches and Tehran’s ambitions to become a nuclear power. The only practical military purpose of the missiles the regime is testing is to carry atomic warheads. And while missile launches are not prohibited by the nuclear pact itself, the separate resolution banning them remains in effect until the deal is implemented, after which a new resolution takes effect that calls on Iran not to develop such missiles for eight years. By flouting the U.N. resolutions, Iran is clearly testing the will of the United States and its allies to enforce the overall regime limiting its nuclear ambitions. If there is no serious response, it will press the boundaries in other areas — such as the inspection regime. It will take maximum advantage of Mr. Obama’s fear of undoing a legacy achievement, unless and until its bluff is called. That’s why the administration would be wise to take firm action now in response to the missile tests rather than trying to sweep them under the carpet.

0,"Daniel Levinson and his family run the website helpboblevinson.com and the Facebook page facebook.com/helpboblevinson.  American and European companies are drafting plans to begin doing business in Iran with the lifting of sanctions as part of this summer’s nuclear-weapons agreement, and Westerners are planning visits to the country. My family and I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous traveling to Iran remains. It is widely known that my father, Robert Levinson, was detained on Iran’s Kish Island on March 9, 2007. Iranian state media even reported as much at the time, though Tehran now denies knowledge of his whereabouts. Iran is holding four other U.S. citizens, including Post reporter Jason Rezaian. It temporarily detained 15 members of the British navy two weeks after my father’s detention and several U.S. and European citizens in the years since. Any foreign national considering a trip to Iranian-controlled territory risks arbitrary detention, potentially without access to any basic human rights or their loved ones for years to come. This is what happened to my father. My mother, my aunt and I went to Iran in late 2007 to retrace my father’s footsteps and meet with officials. We were treated well, and I was struck by the kindness of ordinary Iranians, their sympathy for our situation and the beauty of the country. I would love to return after my father’s case is resolved to see more of what Iran has to offer, but I couldn’t imagine doing so for “fun” anytime soon. We urge everyone to think twice before traveling there. My family has always advocated maintaining an open line of communication between Washington and Tehran, as we believe it can pave the way to improved relations and progress on key issues. We were optimistic about President Obama’s pursuit of direct talks with Iranian officials. In particular, we saw the nuclear talks as a golden opportunity to resolve my father’s case, so long as both sides were willing to negotiate. However, we were devastated that he was not released in the aftermath of the accord. Now we fear that the United States has squandered its best opportunity for leverage in ensuring my father’s safe return home. Of course, the Iranian government is ultimately responsible for my father’s suffering. If the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said four words — “Send Robert Levinson home” — this nightmare would end. But as is the case in matters of diplomacy, we can’t simply rely on Tehran’s goodwill to magically release him; there must be negotiations — give and take. Merely mentioning to Iranian officials that we would like some help in locating him — the official U.S. line for years now — won’t cut it. While Iran has an enormous opportunity to open a new chapter in its relationship with the United States and the world, it is unlikely to do so without incentives. Shortly after the nuclear deal was reached this summer, CBS News’s Major Garrett asked Obama why my father and the other Americans weren’t included in the deal. It was a fair question, but the ensuing media storm about the exchange focused on Garrett’s phrasing and the president’s response to that, rather than on the issue itself. Garrett explained in a follow-up interview, “In the final hours of this deal, the Iranians put other things on the table that hadn’t been previously discussed: the arms embargo on conventional weapons and ballistic missiles. If those could be introduced, it seems to me it’s reasonable to ask the commander-in-chief if other issues on the American side could have been introduced.” Obama insisted then he was not “content” as he “celebrate[s] with American citizens languishing in Iranian jails.” Yet in October, Roll Call reported, “Democrats threw a party to celebrate formal adoption of the Iran nuclear deal,” with several White House officials attending. There should be no celebrating. My father and four other Americans are still there, lost in the misguided euphoria over the nuclear deal. Their plights must never be forgotten, and officials have a responsibility to take immediate action to bring them home. At the same time, Iran should know that the release of my father and the other Americans would be an opportunity to reassure potential foreign partners — both governments and private enterprises — that the country is a welcoming and safe place for their citizens and employees to work. A retired FBI agent and CIA contractor, my father spent over three decades of his life serving the United States: taking on organized-crime families in New York, keeping drugs off our streets and preventing the spread of the Russian mafia to our shores, among other accomplishments in his heroic career. He has languished in isolation for almost nine years, living a nightmare away from everyone he knows and loves.

0,"Compensation for American Embassy personnel held hostage for 444 days in Iran more than three decades ago was hailed on Thursday by the former captives and the lawyers who for years fought Tehran and Washington to get a measure of vindication. A provision buried in a spending bill signed by President Obama last week will give up to $4.4 million to each of the 37 surviving hostages or the estates of 16 others who died in the years since their release. The sum works out to $10,000 for each day of their captivity and will come, in part, from a $9 billion penalty paid by the French bank BNP Paribas for violating sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan. “Iran is not paying the money, but it’s as close as you can get,” said Thomas Lankford, an attorney who represented the former hostages and their families in a lengthy battle that continued even after the courts and the U.S. government repeatedly denied their requests for restitution. Lankford called the restitution “gratifying after a long, long time.” The financial settlement also provides potential benefits for victims of other terrorist attacks, including the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in East Africa and for first responders to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. [The Tehran hostages’ endless siege: A quest for compensation] The compensation for the hostages seized at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held between November 1979 and January 1981 brought some closure to the victims of one of the defining foreign relations crises of the 20th century. It fractured relations between Iran and the United States and ultimately pitted the former hostages not only against the authorities in Tehran, but also against their own government. They were barred from taking legal action against Iran under the 1981 Algiers Accords, brokered by Algerian diplomats, that led to their release. U.S. courts, the State Department and presidents all opposed their attempts to sue, citing the deal reached in Algiers. So lawyers turned to Congress for help, but even those efforts failed time and again. Some hostages said they thought the push to reconsider their claims came after the Iran nuclear deal in July, which angered many members of Congress, and the 2012 Ben Affleck film “Argo,” a political thriller about the CIA’s rescue of six U.S. diplomats in Tehran. “I think ‘Argo,’ followed by the Iran nuclear accord, was very instrumental,” said Joe Hall, 66, who was an Army chief warrant officer and operations coordinator for the U.S. defense attache at the embassy. When Lankford told Hall and other hostages in a conference call that the compensation had been enacted, Hall said, “I had the phone on mute and sat in shock for a few minutes. It was an emotional moment, by myself in the woods.” The part of the bill that brought them vindication was introduced by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee who counts three former hostages, including Hall, among his constituents. He had introduced compensation legislation for the Iran hostages every year since 2013. The law, first reported by USA Today and signed by President Obama on the day he left for vacation in Hawaii, also authorizes payments of $600,000 for each spouses or child of a hostage. The $1.1 billion of the Paribas penalty set aside to repay victims of Iran and other terror attacks is not sufficient to cover all the claims, but the fund will remain open for 10 years so it can be replenished by future fines on sanctions violators and other offenders. Eventually everyone should be paid in full, said Alan Madison, another lawyer for the hostages. “The Iran hostages sacrificed mightily for our country, and I’m delighted that these brave men and women and their families are finally getting some semblance of justice and closure for what they went through,” Isakson said in a statement. Many of the hostages, held by student militants who overran the embassy on Nov. 4, 1979, were treated horribly. They endured mock firing squads and beatings with rubber hoses and were hung over elevator shafts and forced to run blindfolded into trees. The emotional toll on them, and their families, was severe, and in some cases they suffered depression and ruptured personal relations after their release on Jan. 20, 1981, as President Ronald Reagan was being sworn in to office.  One former hostage committed suicide, and there were several suicide attempts, according to Madison. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder “was not really well known back then,” Madison said. “When they came home, they had a big parade, a million and a half people on Broadway, then they were forgotten. No surprise, it altered the arc of their lives.” Deb Firestone, whose father, Bruce German, left his wife and three children a year after his release, said her mother did not expect to see a settlement in her lifetime. Firestone expressed relief at an overdue recognition of the lifelong grief the hostage crisis wrought. “I’m glad the government has finally realized the hostages deserve something,” she said.","Compensation for American Embassy personnel held hostage for 444 days in Iran more than three decades ago was hailed on Thursday by the former captives and the lawyers who for years fought Tehran and Washington to get a measure of vindication.

0,"Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post correspondent who has been held captive by the Iranian government for more than 500 days, was granted a small reprieve Friday when his captors allowed a Christmas Day visit from his wife and mother. “After several efforts, Yegi and I were able to secure permission from the court to meet with Jason for several hours today, Christmas,” Rezaian’s mother, Mary, said in an email to The Post. Yegi is Rezaian’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, an Iranian citizen who is a correspondent for the National, a newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates. “This is the first time in the year that I have been visiting him in Evin Prison that I could spend an extended time there and bring him his first home-cooked meal in months,” Mary Rezaian said in her email. “We had a wonderful time together reminiscing of holidays past.” The Post correspondent earlier this month marked more than 500 days in captivity. That’s longer than the 52 U.S. Embassy personnel who were held captive from November 1979 to January 1981. Rezaian, 39, was born in California and holds both U.S. and Iranian citizenships. He was quietly convicted in closed proceedings earlier this year after being charged with espionage and related allegations. Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron issued the following statement: “We are enormously pleased that our colleague Jason was permitted to spend extended time with his mother, Mary, and his wife, Yegi. It is a happy occasion for them and for all of us. And yet, we have to note, this visit is a rare exception in the 522 days of tragic, unjust imprisonment of a good, honorable and innocent man. “We welcome this act of basic humanity, and we encourage his jailers in Iran to follow up by doing all that justice and decency require: Release Jason from prison and allow him a return to life as a free man who can spend time with his family where and whenever he pleases.” Rezaian is being held in Evin Prison, which houses a number of high-profile political prisoners. A spokesman for Iran’s judiciary last month confirmed that a prison sentence was handed down in a statement on the state Islamic Republic News Agency’s website, according to the Associated Press. The length of the sentence has not been disclosed publicly. Mary Rezaian’s email included a message from her son: “Jason wants all his colleagues at The Post, the advertising department, cartoonists, everyone including the janitors to know how very much he appreciates their efforts, support and goodwill. He knows you all are working harder than any other entity to secure his release. And the knowledge of that is what gives him strength every day. “Jason is sending his warmest nondenominational season’s greetings to everyone at The Post and wishes for a very happy and productive new year.”","Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post correspondent who has been held captive by the Iranian government for more than 500 days, was granted a small reprieve Friday when his captors allowed a Christmas Day visit from his wife and mother. “After several efforts, Yegi and I were able to secure permission from the court to meet with Jason for several hours today, Christmas,” Rezaian’s mother, Mary, said in an email to The Post.

0,"One of the arguments for the Iran nuclear deal was that it would encourage greater openness and investment from the West. But Iranian hard-liners have been working in recent months to sabotage the proponents of economic globalization and change. The clearest example is the case of an Iranian American businessman named Siamak Namazi, 44, who was arrested around Oct. 14. Iran hasn’t announced any formal charges, but he has been accused in the Iranian press of being a tool of such institutions as the World Economic Forum, the National Endowment for Democracy, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. According to Iranian press accounts, Namazi is being held by the intelligence service of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in a special section of Evin Prison. News organizations close to the IRGC have published conspiracy stories that appear to be drawn from his interrogation and from information on his laptop . The allegations center, bizarrely, on Namazi’s status as a “Young Global Leader” under a program organized by the World Economic Forum. A story posted on the hard-line website Raja News describes the forum and its youth fellowships as part of a “Zionist” network that uses investment and trade as tools of political subversion. Another story, posted by Jahan News, links Namazi to the other think tanks and foundations that it claims are part of a Western “influence network.” The real target of the hard-liners may be President Hassan Rouhani, whose government has been a proponent of greater openness and economic integration with the West. Rouhani’s government had blessed a planned visit to Iran last June by 20 Young Global Leaders, arranged through Sorena Sattari, Iran’s vice president for science and technology. But the trip was canceled after it was criticized by hard-liners. The Namazi incident is a reality check for those who hoped that the nuclear agreement would be the prelude to a broader opening. Since the agreement was reached in July, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has repeatedly said that Iran won’t allow economic “infiltration” by a United States he described last month as a “deceitful, crafty, skillful, fraudulent and devilish enemy.” The imprisonment of Namazi in October came days after an Iranian court convicted Post reporter Jason Rezaian, also an Iranian American, on charges of espionage. Marty Baron, The Post’s executive editor, called the verdict “an outrageous injustice.” “Their message is that they are going to scare and intimidate Iranians abroad who want to return to Iran,” argued Bijan Khajehpour, an Iranian who hired Namazi in 1997 at Atieh Bahar Consulting, a Tehran firm that advised Western companies investing in Iran. Namazi left Atieh Bahar in 2007, and Khajehpour left the country in 2011 under pressure from the regime. He now operates a similar consulting firm in Vienna. There may be a class-warfare aspect to these political attacks. Like many Iranians who have prospered in the diaspora, Namazi is from a family that was prominent during the Shah’s time. His father was governor of Khuzestan province and left Iran after the revolution. Namazi graduated from Tufts University, returned to Iran to serve in the military, and then studied management at London Business School and urban planning at Rutgers University. The message from the hard-liners, whose IRGC-linked businesses have prospered since the revolution, is that they won’t give up economic or political power to the old elite, as sanctions are lifted and foreign investment grows in Iran. Just as the IRGC evidently hopes, the Namazi case has chilled some Iranian American business leaders who had considered investing in Iran. An example is a group called iBridges, which includes some wealthy Iranian Americans, such as Hamid Biglari, who was a senior executive at Citigroup. The technology group gathered Iranian entrepreneurs for a first iBridges meeting in 2014 in Berkeley, Calif.; it held a second, larger meeting with more than 1,000 participants in June in Berlin. But iBridges has been attacked in the Iranian press, and some of its members — who were enthusiastic just a few months ago about funding start-ups in Iran — are said to be reconsidering. Says one Iranian American who has pulled back from planned investments: “All this is a warning shot across the bow to the entire diaspora: Don’t even think about coming back to rebuild relations with the West.” Rouhani and other pragmatists argue that foreign investment will strengthen Iran and boost its national security. But hard-liners insist that Western money is a tool of the Great Satan that will undermine the revolution. This battle over foreign influence will be one of Iran’s fault lines in the year ahead.

0,"NEW YORK has joined several other states in promising to scale back solitary confinement, the institutionalized torture to which prisons across the country subject thousands of inmates every day. The excuse for extreme prisoner isolation is that it maintains order. The reality is that the punishment is wildly overused, and the conditions are often of the sort you’d expect to read about in a human rights report on a Third World dictatorship, a system seemingly designed to break people down, encourage mental illness and inflict deep misery and emotional desperation. New York has some 4,000 prisoners in solitary confinement, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union, which has been pressing a lawsuit against the state. Under a settlement the NYCLU struck with the state, about a quarter of those prisoners will move out of traditional solitary confinement. This group will include people who were isolated as punishment for minor offenses, prisoners who require intensive behavioral therapy, inmates who need drug treatment, people who are developmentally disabled, minors and prisoners who are set to be released directly from isolation back into their communities. Those who violate prison drug restrictions one time and those who break minor rules will also be ineligible for isolation. Solitary confinement is obviously inappropriate for all of these groups. New York will also reduce solitary confinement terms. The NYCLU says that the average stay in isolation is roughly five months. Now, the maximum term will be three months, except in a few circumstances. The most stringent term for most inmates in solitary for their first time will be 30 days. Officers will also have to explain in writing why they put a prisoner in solitary. These changes do not mean that inmates who pose special challenges, such as the mentally ill or the drug-addicted, should simply be thrown back into the general prison population. Programs need to addresses their needs, including various types of treatment to help inmates recover from their time in solitary confinement before they reenter the general prison population or hit the streets. They should have access to reading materials, group recreation time and other programming that’s likely to help them rather than incite or exacerbate mental illness, as the current solitary system can do. These steps won’t just be good for the prisoners themselves; they also could contribute to good order inside and outside New York’s prisons. Some prisoners inevitably will be too dangerous to keep around others. When prison violence is the alternative, these inmates can and should be set apart. But they shouldn’t be mistreated. The settlement, therefore, seeks to not just reduce the number of people relegated to solitary confinement but also improve conditions inside. Prisoners who must now spend 23 hours in a 6-by-10-foot concrete cell will have more opportunities for longer periods of out-of-cell recreation and, if it’s feasible, group interaction. They will be guaranteed access to radios and more reading material. They will be offered mental-health counseling. Isolated prisoners also will no longer have to choke down “the loaf” — a disgusting melange of bread, root vegetables and potatoes. New York’s move won’t put it in the top class of states reforming solitary confinement. But it’s a massive move simply because of the number of prisoners in the state — almost 60,000. Others should follow, whether or not they are facing a lawsuit.

1,"Iran freed four imprisoned Iranian-Americans on Saturday in exchange for seven Iranians held or charged in the United States, U.S. officials said. One of the four was Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. Rezaian, who is 39 and was the Washington Post’s chief reporter in Iran, had been in prison for 18 months. He was accused of spying, a charge that he, the Post and the U.S. government said was untrue. Rezaian was found guilty in a secret trial that ended in August. It was not announced how long he was to spend in prison. The deal took place as Iran, the United States and European nations were meeting in Vienna, Austria, about lifting sanctions, or penalties against doing business with Iran. The released Americans, who also included former Marine Amir Hekmati and pastor Saeed Abidini, were to be flown from Iran to Switzerland and then brought to a U.S. military base in Germany for medical treatment. The name of the fourth prisoner was not confirmed. In return, the United States agreed to either pardon or drop charges against seven Iranians — six of whom also have American citizenship — accused or convicted of violating U.S. sanctions. The United States and other Western nations created sanctions to try to stop Iran from building nuclear weapons. Iran agreed last summer to limit its nuclear programs if the West would lift sanctions. Both sides were in Vienna on Saturday to figure out whether Iran had made good on its promise. If so, sanctions were to end immediately.

1,"The leading Republican presidential candidates accused President Obama on Saturday of catering to a dangerous theocracy by offering clemency to seven Iranians as part of a deal freeing four Americans, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. Even as some of those candidates welcomed the release of the Americans, they said the deal encourages hostage-taking or took far too long to arrange. “This should have been done three, four years ago, when the deal was struck,” Republican front-runner Donald Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign rally. “I’m happy they’re coming back, but I will tell you it’s a disgrace that they’ve been there for so long. It’s a disgrace, remember that. A total disgrace.” Rezaian; Saeed Abedini, of Boise, Idaho; Amir Hekmati, of Flint, Mich.; and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari were freed Saturday. A fifth American, student Matthew Trevithick, was freed separately. U.S. and Iranian officials said the releases were in exchange for seven people imprisoned or charged in the United States, and both nations linked the agreement to the landmark nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers. Trump indicated that he did not agree with the terms of the four Americans’ release. He accused the Obama administration of further capitulating to Iranian demands by giving Iran $150 billion in sanctions relief under the nuclear deal. “So essentially they get ­$150 billion plus seven [offered clemency], and we get four,” Trump said. “Doesn’t sound too good. Doesn’t sound too good.” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), running second to Trump in major polls and a strong contender to defeat Trump in the Iowa caucus vote two weeks away, thanked God for the release but added a caveat about the terms of the arrangement. “We don’t know the details of the deal that is bringing them home, and it may well be that there are some very problematic aspects to this deal,” Cruz told reporters in Fort Mill, S.C. “But at least this morning I am giving thanks that pastor Saeed is coming home. It’s far later than it should have been, but we will be glad to welcome him home.” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said the deal to grant clemency to seven Iranians charged in the United States in exchange for the Americans’ release opens the door for other regimes to try to use captured Americans as bargaining chips. “The fact of the matter is that this tells us everything we need to know about the Iranian regime. That they take people hostage in order to gain concessions,” Rubio said while campaigning in Iowa. “And the fact that they can get away with it with this administration, I think, has created an incentive for more governments to do this around the world.” Rubio has previously expressed support for Rezaian by wearing a “Free Jason” pin, but like other Republican critics of the Obama administration, Rubio maintains that the jailed Americans should have been freed without conditions. “They shouldn’t have been in jail,” Rubio said. “This is hostage-taking.” The agreement came just as the United States and other world powers lift many international sanctions on Iran as part of the deal struck last year to curb Iran’s nuclear program. The Obama administration has previously maintained that while Secretary of State John F. Kerry and other officials raised the Rezaian case and others at their meetings and negotiations with Iranian officials, prisoner releases would not be part of the nuclear deal. The releases follow Obama administration agreements to win the release of an American from Cuba and an American soldier captured in Afghanistan by the Taliban. Republicans, including some running for president, have said both those deals reveal a fundamental weakness and naivete in Obama’s dealings with autocrats and terrorists. The Republicans have also roundly criticized the Iran nuclear deal as a risky gamble that endangers U.S. ally Israel. In all cases, the Obama administration counters that the deals are triumphs of diplomacy and statecraft, and were made with clear-eyed knowledge of the trade-offs. “You are incentivizing people to take Americans hostage and prisoner even if they’ve done nothing wrong,” Rubio said. “Governments are taking Americans hostage because they believe they can gain concessions from this government under Barack Obama. It’s created an incentive for more people to do this in the future.” Rubio also repeated his pledge to scrap the international nuclear deal on his “first day in office.” Trump railed against Iran, raising questions about its commitment to peace and the administration’s grasp of the situation. Referring to the high-profile temporary detention of 10 U.S Navy sailors by Iranian military officials last week, Trump panned the country for its response. “I don’t know what happened. I guess it sounded like they took a little shortcut through a big body of water. Okay, big deal. And they got locked in, and they dropped to their knees in a begging position. Hands up, guns to their heads,” Trump said, describing photos showing the sailors surrendering to Iranians. “And this is supposed to be our ally?” he added. Presumptive Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton was secretary of state in Obama’s first term, service she touts as preparation for real-world crises that none of her challengers, Democratic or Republican, possess. She participated in the initial outreach to Iran that led to the nuclear discussions, but the deal was struck after she left office. She supports the agreement but regularly says she would seek to strengthen it and would enforce it rigorously as president. She has said it is in the Iranian “nature” to try to cheat. Clinton welcomed the releases and implementation of the nuclear deal in a statement late Saturday. “But we shouldn’t thank Iran for the prisoners or for following through on its obligations. These prisoners were held unjustly by a regime that continues to threaten the peace and security of the Middle East,” she said. Clinton’s surging competitor, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, was the first 2016 candidate to issue a statement on the Americans’ release. “This good news shows that diplomacy can work even in this volatile region of the world,” Sanders said. Clinton’s campaign did not immediately react to the news. Some Republicans also welcomed the releases while criticizing the terms. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush suggested he would have threatened Iran. “I would say . . . ‘If you do not release them, that there’s going to be military action, that that’s an act of provocation, an act of war,’ ” Bush said in Amherst, N.H., according to CNN. “What I would do in January is recognize that Iran is not an ally. That’s how the Obama administration views this.” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he wants to know more about “the other side of the deal.” “We shouldn’t have to swap prisoners. These folks were taken illegally in violation of international law, and they should have been released without condition. But you know, the Iranians have treated this president with disrespect for years, and he continues to take it,” Christie said. “I would not take it as president.” Speaking to reporters at a tea party convention in Myrtle Beach, S.C., low-polling Republican candidate Mike Huckabee said the Americans “should have been released before we ever sat down at the negotiating table.” Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson applauded the Americans’ release but added that the nuclear deal presents a danger to U.S. national security interests. “The fact remains that President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran is fatally flawed and gravely jeopardizes the national security interests of the American people, our ally Israel and other peaceful nations in the Middle East and around the world,” Carson said. But Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) praised the decision to try to free the Americans, even at a cost. “Even though Iran is a country with very limited freedom, we were willing to negotiate,” Paul said. “It goes to temperament. All the other Republicans are telling you — rip up that agreement. I say: ‘Really?’ Don’t we want to see if it works first?” David Weigel, Ed O’Keefe and Jose A. DelReal contributed to this report.","The leading Republican presidential candidates accused President Obama on Saturday of catering to a dangerous theocracy by offering clemency to seven Iranians as part of a deal freeing four Americans, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said the deal to grant clemency to seven Iranians charged in the United States in exchange for the Americans’ release opens the door for other regimes to try to use captured Americans as bargaining chips. “The fact of the matter is that this tells us everything we need to know about the Iranian regime. That they take people hostage in order to gain concessions,” Rubio said while campaigning in Iowa. “And the fact that they can get away with it with this administration, I think, has created an incentive for more governments to do this around the world.” Rubio has previously expressed support for Rezaian by wearing a “Free Jason” pin, but like other Republican critics of the Obama administration, Rubio maintains that the jailed Americans should have been freed without conditions. “They shouldn’t have been in jail,” Rubio said. “This is hostage-taking.” The agreement came just as the United States and other world powers lift many international sanctions on Iran as part of the deal struck last year to curb Iran’s nuclear program. The Obama administration has previously maintained that while Secretary of State John F. Kerry and other officials raised the Rezaian case and others at their meetings and negotiations with Iranian officials, prisoner releases would not be part of the nuclear deal. The releases follow Obama administration agreements to win the release of an American from Cuba and an American soldier captured in Afghanistan by the Taliban. Republicans, including some running for president, have said both those deals reveal a fundamental weakness and naivete in Obama’s dealings with autocrats and terrorists. The Republicans have also roundly criticized the Iran nuclear deal as a risky gamble that endangers U.S. ally Israel. In all cases, the Obama administration counters that the deals are triumphs of diplomacy and statecraft, and were made with clear-eyed knowledge of the trade-offs. “You are incentivizing people to take Americans hostage and prisoner even if they’ve done nothing wrong,” Rubio said. “Governments are taking Americans hostage because they believe they can gain concessions from this government under Barack Obama. It’s created an incentive for more people to do this in the future.” Rubio also repeated his pledge to scrap the international nuclear deal on his “first day in office.” Trump railed against Iran, raising questions about its commitment to peace and the administration’s grasp of the situation. Referring to the high-profile temporary detention of 10 U.S Navy sailors by Iranian military officials last week, Trump panned the country for its response. “I don’t know what happened. I guess it sounded like they took a little shortcut through a big body of water. Okay, big deal. And they got locked in, and they dropped to their knees in a begging position. Hands up, guns to their heads,” Trump said, describing photos showing the sailors surrendering to Iranians. “And this is supposed to be our ally?” he added. Presumptive Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton was secretary of state in Obama’s first term, service she touts as preparation for real-world crises that none of her challengers, Democratic or Republican, possess. She participated in the initial outreach to Iran that led to the nuclear discussions, but the deal was struck after she left office. She supports the agreement but regularly says she would seek to strengthen it and would enforce it rigorously as president. She has said it is in the Iranian “nature” to try to cheat. Clinton welcomed the releases and implementation of the nuclear deal in a statement late Saturday. “But we shouldn’t thank Iran for the prisoners or for following through on its obligations. These prisoners were held unjustly by a regime that continues to threaten the peace and security of the Middle East,” she said. Clinton’s surging competitor, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, was the first 2016 candidate to issue a statement on the Americans’ release. “This good news shows that diplomacy can work even in this volatile region of the world,” Sanders said. Clinton’s campaign did not immediately react to the news. Some Republicans also welcomed the releases while criticizing the terms. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush suggested he would have threatened Iran. “I would say . . . ‘If you do not release them, that there’s going to be military action, that that’s an act of provocation, an act of war,’ ” Bush said in Amherst, N.H., according to CNN. “What I would do in January is recognize that Iran is not an ally. That’s how the Obama administration views this.” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he wants to know more about “the other side of the deal.” “We shouldn’t have to swap prisoners. These folks were taken illegally in violation of international law, and they should have been released without condition. But you know, the Iranians have treated this president with disrespect for years, and he continues to take it,” Christie said. “I would not take it as president.” Speaking to reporters at a tea party convention in Myrtle Beach, S.C., low-polling Republican candidate Mike Huckabee said the Americans “should have been released before we ever sat down at the negotiating table.” Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson applauded the Americans’ release but added that the nuclear deal presents a danger to U.S. national security interests. “The fact remains that President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran is fatally flawed and gravely jeopardizes the national security interests of the American people, our ally Israel and other peaceful nations in the Middle East and around the world,” Carson said. But Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) praised the decision to try to free the Americans, even at a cost. “Even though Iran is a country with very limited freedom, we were willing to negotiate,” Paul said. “It goes to temperament. All the other Republicans are telling you — rip up that agreement. I say: ‘Really?’ Don’t we want to see if it works first?” David Weigel, Ed O’Keefe and Jose A. DelReal contributed to this report."
0,"As the families of Americans celebrate the release of their loved ones held in Iran, the authorities in Tehran said they would not be freeing a businessman arrested in October and were silent on the fate of a former FBI agent who disappeared in the country. It was unclear why Siamak Namazi, 44, an Iranian American based in Dubai, was arrested in October while visiting a friend in Tehran where he had done consultant work over the previous decade. Namazi is the son of a prominent family in Tehran who couldn’t be reached. Namazi immigrated to the United States in 1983, and he later returned to Iran after graduating from college to serve in the Iranian military. “I don’t know what’s going on,” said Ahmad Kiarostami, a friend. “I’m still hopeful he’s going to be released in the next few days. That’s what I hope.” Kiarostami said he had traded Facebook messages with Namazi’s family in Iran, but they didn’t know anything. He said it was a “big surprise” when Namazi wasn’t freed with the others. U.S. officials said Saturday that they would continue to talk with Iran to secure the release of Namazi as well as to obtain information about the whereabouts of Robert Levinson, 67, who went missing on an Iranian island in March 2007. News that Levinson had not been freed left his family distraught. “Of course we are happy for those families, but angry and devastated,” Suzanne Halpin, the sister of Levinson’s wife, said in an email. The Levinsons have hoped for years that their father would eventually be released after a deal was reached to limit the Iranian nuclear program. The family thought the United States had “squandered its best opportunity for leverage in ensuring my father’s safe return home,” Levinson’s son, Daniel, wrote late last year in The Washington Post, after Iran and six world powers struck a nuclear deal. It was an ominous sign that he wasn’t released with other the Americans, officials said. “They were given every opportunity to save face,” a U.S. intelligence official said Saturday. “We are still not giving up.” The Iranians have never acknowledged holding Levinson, and some former and current U.S. intelligence officials fear that he might be dead. “Discussions with the Iranians have focused on trying to discern his whereabouts and bring him home,” said a senior administration official, speaking on anonymity guidelines set by the administration. “We weren’t able to do that in that time frame and we have agreed with the Iranians that we will continue to use the channels that [now] exist for that purpose.” A second administration official said that agreement over the other prisoners provides “an opportunity to focus specifically on identifying [Levinson’s] whereabouts. . . . We recognize that his family has endured the hardship of his disappearance for over eight years now, and we will not cease our efforts” until he is returned home. Levinson joined the FBI’s New York field office in 1978 after spending six years with the Drug Enforcement Administration. He was an expert on the New York mob’s five families. Eventually, he moved to the Miami office, where he tracked Russian organized-crime figures and developed a reputation for developing sources. After retiring from the FBI in 1998, Levinson worked as a private investigator and as a CIA contractor. Levinson was supposed to produce academic-like papers for the agency but was operating more like a spy, gathering intelligence for the CIA and writing numerous well-received reports, officials said. Levinson traveled the globe. He went to Turkey and Canada, among other countries, to interview potential sources, sometimes using a fake name. But CIA station chiefs in those countries were never notified of Levinson’s activities overseas, even though the agency reimbursed him for his travel, a violation of the rules. On March 8, 2007, Levinson flew from Dubai to the Iranian island of Kish and checked into a hotel. He entered Iran to gather information about government corruption. He met with Dawud Salahuddin, a fugitive wanted for the murder of an Iranian dissident and diplomat who was shot at his house in Bethesda, Md. Levinson thought Salahuddin could supply details about the Iranian regime, perhaps information that could interest the CIA, according to officials who have reconstructed some of his movements. Levinson spent hours talking to Salahuddin. The next morning, Levinson checked out of his hotel and vanished, officials said. The United States suspected the Iranian security services were behind his abduction, according to a diplomatic cable disclosed by WikiLeaks. The FBI has offered $5 million for information leading to his safe return. The CIA ultimately concluded that it was responsible for Levinson while he was in Iran and paid $2.5 million to his wife, Christine, former U.S. intelligence officials have said. The CIA leadership disciplined 10 employees, including three veteran analysts who were forced out of their jobs, the officials said, because Levinson was run by people who had no authority to manage operations overseas. The last proof of life came about three years ago when the Levinson family received a 54-second video of him and later pictures of him shackled and dressed in an orange jumpsuit similar to those worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. “I have been held here for 3

1,"President Obama offered clemency to seven Iranians charged with violating U.S. trade sanctions against Iran as part of a historic prisoner agreement with Iran that freed four Americans Saturday, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. The Iranians, six of whom are dual U.S.-Iranian citizens, were imprisoned or were pending trial in the United States. The U.S. government dismissed charges against 14 other Iranians, all outside the United States, after assessing that extradition requests were unlikely to be successful, according to a U.S. official. The official also said that Iran has committed to continue cooperating with the United States to determine the location of retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, who disappeared in Iran more than nine years ago. Iran’s semiofficial Fars News Agency released names of the seven individuals. The Department of Justice declined to confirm their identities. Joel Androphy, an attorney for one of the Iranians — Bahram Mechanic — said his client was offered a full pardon. Androphy also worked closely with the attorneys for two of the other men who were pardoned, Tooraj “Roger” Faridi, and Khosrow Afghahi. The three men are Iranian American businessmen who were indicted last year and accused of illegally exporting microelectronics to Iran that could aid the country’s nuclear program. “They’re ecstatic,” said Androphy, who said the men were told Wednesday that Obama was pardoning them. Mechanic and Afghahi were being held without bail in a federal detention facility in Houston. Faridi, who lives in Houston, was not in custody, Androphy said. The released Iranians were on a long list that Tehran initially gave the U.S. government early in the negotiations, a list eventually whittled down to the seven, according to a senior U.S. official who briefed reporters under a condition of anonymity set by the administration. The official said that Obama insisted that none of the individuals be “people who have been prosecuted for offenses related to terrorism . . . or violent crime.” All, the official said, were convicted or accused of “crimes related to violating our trade embargo or sanctions.” The April 2015 indictment against Mechanic, Faridi, and Afghahi, for violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, alleges the men and their Houston-based company, Smart Power Systems, were members of an Iranian procurement network operating in the United States. The men, who pleaded not guilty and said their business consisted of buying parts in other countries to build surge protectors for computers, were charged as part of a larger scheme involving individuals and companies in Turkey and Taiwan. They had not yet gone to trial. “They feel victimized by the government,” Androphy said. “People should be happy that both countries did the right thing by releasing people that were unfairly confined.” He said his clients were “victims of disputes between countries, not people who’ve committed any horrific crimes.” Androphy said his clients, who were born in Iran and naturalized more than five years ago, are now free to travel and would remain in the United States with their families. Mechanic will drop his lawsuit against the United States for unlawfully seizing his business in Tehran, and he plans to travel to Iran to continue his business there, Androphy said. Another Iranian who will be released is Nader Modanlo, a Montgomery County businessman who prosecutors said used his aerospace expertise and connections with Russia to help Iran launch a satellite for the first time. Modanlo, a U.S. citizen born in Iran and living in Potomac, was sentenced in 2013 to eight years in prison for conspiring to illegally provide satellite-related services to Iran, in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Iran trade embargo. Modanlo, then 52, was also convicted of money-laundering and obstruction of bankruptcy proceedings. Maryland U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein said at the time that, partly as a result of Modanlo’s actions, an Iranian Earth-observation satellite equipped with a camera was launched into space from Russia on Oct. 27, 2005. “Modanlo violated the law by helping Iran launch communications satellites,” Rosenstein said. A jury convicted Modanlo, finding that he illegally facilitated a satellite deal between Iran and Russia and received a $10 million brokering fee. “Mr. Modanlo has been fighting to clear his name for nearly a decade,” Modanlo’s attorney, Lucius Outlaw III, said after the trial in federal court in Greenbelt. “Unfortunately, the fight will have to continue.” Also in 2013, Rosenstein announced that Ali Saboonchi, then 32, a U.S. citizen living in Parkville, Md., had been indicted on charges of conspiring to export and exporting U.S.-manufactured industrial products and services to Iran. In a five-count indictment, Saboonchi, who has been imprisoned in Petersburg, Va., was charged with creating a business, Ace Electric, for the purpose of obtaining goods to be sent to Iran. An attorney now representing Modanlo, Kelly Kramer, declined to comment. Outlaw, who now represents Saboonchi, said in an e-mail about 6 a.m. Sunday that Saboonchi has been released. He and another attorney, Elizabeth Oyer, said in a statement: ""Ali Saboonchi is a beloved and hard-working family man and American. He was born in the U.S. and is proud to be raising his young family here. His arrest and incarceration were devastating to his many friends and family. Ali is thrilled and grateful for his release and return to his family. Ali's release shows that he poses no danger to the American people. He has a bright future ahead."" Another Iranian national who was granted clemency is Nima Golestaneh, 30, who pleaded guilty in December to charges of wire fraud and unauthorized access to computers related to the October 2012 hacking of a Vermont-based engineering consulting and software company. Golestaneh conspired with others to hack the network and computers at Arrow Tech Associates to steal company software and business information, according to the plea agreement. Golestaneh acquired servers in other countries for his co-conspirators to use remotely to launch computer intrusions into companies, including Arrow Tech. The seventh Iranian is Arash Ghahreman, 45, a naturalized U.S. citizen and former Iranian national who was convicted in April by a federal jury in San Diego of violations of U.S. export and money-laundering laws linked to his involvement in a scheme to purchase marine navigation equipment and military electronic equipment for illegal export to Iran. “The defendants used a front company to illegally send U.S. goods and technologies, including those used in military applications to Iran,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin said after the conviction. Ellis M. Johnston III, Ghahreman's attorney, said Ghahreman was released from a federal prison camp about 6 a.m. Sunday. Johnston said Ghahreman -- who wasn't pardoned, but rather, had his sentence commuted -- planned to spend some time with his aunt and her family on the East Coast, reunite with his girlfriend on the West Coast and ""hopefully visit his elderly parents in Iran, whom he hasn't seen in years since this case began."" ""Mr. Ghahreman and his family are extremely relieved by his release,"" Johnston said in an email. ""For my part, I'm obviously happy for Mr Ghahreman's release; he's a very kind, considerate man who poses no threat to the United States and who, if given the chance despite his felony conviction (which still stands because he wasn't pardoned; his sentence was only commuted), will succeed professionally here, abroad, or wherever he chooses."".

0,"Three of the four Americans released from Tehran’s Evin Prison on Saturday as part of an exchange were all men with dual citizenship who traveled to Iran for deeply personal reasons. Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, 32, a former U.S. Marine from Flint, Mich., was visiting an ailing grandmother. Saeed Abedini, 35, an evangelical pastor from Boise, Idaho, was working on building an orphanage with his wife. And Jason Rezaian, 39, a Washington Post reporter raised in Marin County, Calif., was writing about the rapid changes in his father’s homeland, including a surprising new enthusiasm for baseball. The stories of their imprisonment — which collectively spanned about nine years and nine months — captured the public’s attention around the world and created tremendous outrage against Iran. Little is known about the fourth American, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, whose detention had not been previously publicized. Iranian state television described him as a businessman. On Saturday, the men’s families expressed their gratitude to the Obama administration for working on the deal, but their statements appeared to be tempered by anxiety and mistrust of the Iranian government. “We thank everyone for your thoughts during this time,” Hekmati’s family said. But, they cautioned, “There are still many unknowns. At this point, we are hoping and praying for Amir’s long-awaited return.” Hekmati is the longest-held American prisoner confirmed to have been held by Iran. Arrested in August 2011, he was accused of being a CIA spy. Both he and the U.S. government have denied the charges and maintained his innocence. He was initially convicted of espionage and sentenced to death, but a higher court overturned that ruling. He was then charged with “cooperating with hostile governments” and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Hekmati’s family has accused Iran of subjecting him to physical and mental torture and solitary confinement in a tiny cell. In December he launched a hunger strike to protest his captivity and lost weight and was having trouble breathing. Earlier this month, he was allowed to receive medical treatment at a hospital outside the prison for swelling in his neck and face — a concession that was taken as a sign that he might be considered for release. In a letter dictated to his mother over the phone while in prison, Hekmati described himself as a geopolitical pawn and vowed never to return to Iran. “It has become very clear to me that those responsible view Iranian Americans not as citizens or even human beings but as bargaining chips and tools for propaganda,” he said. Abedini, a convert from Islam to Christianity, was detained in July 2012 for organizing home churches. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. His case was the most high-profile religious persecution for Christians in recent years, regularly mentioned by evangelical pastors in pulpits across the country. His wife, Naghmeh Abedini, who grew up in Boise and lives there with the couple’s two children — Rebekka, 9, and Jacob, 7 — said Saturday that the deal “has been an answer to prayer.” In an interview, she recounted how she woke her two children at 7:30 a.m. to tell them of the news that their father had been released. “They were shocked,” she said. “You can probably hear them now, jumping up and down, asking ‘When are we going to see him?’ It’s been a time of rejoicing.” Naghmeh Abedini has been a high-profile advocate for her husband, posting updates on social media and speaking at Christian conferences across the country. Born and raised in Iran, Abedini became a U.S. citizen in 2010 but returned to Iran regularly. His wife said that he had been beaten and interrogated when he was first imprisoned and suffered internal bleeding but she does not know his current physical condition. She said that once he leaves Iranian soil, they will discuss whether she will fly and meet him somewhere or if they will meet when he returns to the United States. Naghmeh Abedini said it’s unclear whether her husband will continue to be a pastor, though it’s always been “his heart.” “I think he would have to deal with a lot of issues,” she said. “There will need to be a time of healing for him and his family.” A fifth American, identified as Matt Trevithick, was also released Saturday but was not part of the exchange. Trevithick’s parents said in a statement that he had been held for 40 days in Evin Prison. They did not describe any formal charges and referred to his captivity as a “detention.” Reached by phone, his sister said she wasn’t able to offer any more comments beyond that the family is “profoundly grateful to all those who worked for his release and are happy for all the families whose loved ones are also heading home.” Trevithick, who recently turned 30 and is from Hingham, Mass., near Boston, went to Iran in September for a four-month intensive-language program at a language center affiliated with Tehran University in order to work on his fluency in Dari, a language closely related to Farsi.

Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, 32, a former U.S. Marine from Flint, Mich., was visiting an ailing grandmother. Saeed Abedini, 35, an evangelical pastor from Boise, Idaho, was working on building an orphanage with his wife. And Jason Rezaian, 39, a Washington Post reporter raised in Marin County, Calif., was writing about the rapid changes in his father’s homeland, including a surprising new enthusiasm for baseball. The stories of their imprisonment — which collectively spanned about nine years and nine months — captured the public’s attention around the world and created tremendous outrage against Iran. Little is known about the fourth American, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, whose detention had not been previously publicized. Iranian state television described him as a businessman. On Saturday, the men’s families expressed their gratitude to the Obama administration for working on the deal, but their statements appeared to be tempered by anxiety and mistrust of the Iranian government. “We thank everyone for your thoughts during this time,” Hekmati’s family said. But, they cautioned, “There are still many unknowns. At this point, we are hoping and praying for Amir’s long-awaited return.” Hekmati is the longest-held American prisoner confirmed to have been held by Iran. Arrested in August 2011, he was accused of being a CIA spy. Both he and the U.S. government have denied the charges and maintained his innocence. He was initially convicted of espionage and sentenced to death, but a higher court overturned that ruling. He was then charged with “cooperating with hostile governments” and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Hekmati’s family has accused Iran of subjecting him to physical and mental torture and solitary confinement in a tiny cell. In December he launched a hunger strike to protest his captivity and lost weight and was having trouble breathing. Earlier this month, he was allowed to receive medical treatment at a hospital outside the prison for swelling in his neck and face — a concession that was taken as a sign that he might be considered for release. In a letter dictated to his mother over the phone while in prison, Hekmati described himself as a geopolitical pawn and vowed never to return to Iran. “It has become very clear to me that those responsible view Iranian Americans not as citizens or even human beings but as bargaining chips and tools for propaganda,” he said. Abedini, a convert from Islam to Christianity, was detained in July 2012 for organizing home churches. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. His case was the most high-profile religious persecution for Christians in recent years, regularly mentioned by evangelical pastors in pulpits across the country. His wife, Naghmeh Abedini, who grew up in Boise and lives there with the couple’s two children — Rebekka, 9, and Jacob, 7 — said Saturday that the deal “has been an answer to prayer.” In an interview, she recounted how she woke her two children at 7:30 a.m. to tell them of the news that their father had been released. “They were shocked,” she said. “You can probably hear them now, jumping up and down, asking ‘When are we going to see him?’ It’s been a time of rejoicing.” Naghmeh Abedini has been a high-profile advocate for her husband, posting updates on social media and speaking at Christian conferences across the country.

April 25, 2015: Obama, in remarks at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner in Washington, notes that journalists have been murdered “for nothing more than trying to shine a light into some of the world’s darkest corners.” He added: “We remember the journalists unjustly imprisoned around the world, including our own Jason Rezaian. For nine months, Jason has been imprisoned in Tehran for nothing more than writing about the hopes and the fears of the Iranian people, carrying their stories to the readers of The Washington Post in an effort to bridge our common humanity.

Kerry says: “There was not a meeting that took place, not one meeting that took place — believe me, that’s not an exaggeration — where we did not raise the issue of our American citizens being held. And in fact, it was the last conversation that I had with the foreign minister at the Vienna Center, right before we went out publicly. I talked to him the last time about that.” July 20, 2015: Ahsan tells the Associated Press that Revolutionary Court officials have told her that Rezaian’s next court session, which was unscheduled, will “almost certainly” be the last. “Still, it’s not clear how long it will take for the court to issue a verdict on the case after the last session.” July 20, 2015: The U.N. Security Council unanimously approves a legally binding resolution that creates the basis for lifting the United Nations’ international economic sanctions against Iran.

Iran needs to help us find Robert Levinson.” July 22, 2015: As Rezaian enters his second year of custody in Evin Prison, The Post petitions the United Nations for “urgent action” to help secure his release.

Oct. 9, 2015: The 444th day of Rezaian’s imprisonment in Iran.

1,"THE ANNOUNCED implementation of the Iranian nuclear deal on Saturday came with an important bonus: Tehran’s release of four U.S. citizens it had imprisoned, including The Post’s Jason Rezaian. The Americans were exchanged for seven people charged or convicted of crimes in the United States, and the dropping of U.S. cases against 14 others whose arrest was sought. Mr. Rezaian, who was held for 544 days, committed no crime and should have never been arrested. He was not a convict but a political hostage. His freeing and that of the other Americans ends a gross injustice. When Mr. Rezaian, a 39-year-old dual Iranian and U.S. citizen born and raised in California, was seized in his home with his Iranian wife, Yeganeh Salehi, on July 22, 2014, Iran had recently extended an interim agreement on its nuclear program with the United States. As the nuclear negotiations continued, Mr. Rezaian languished in Tehran’s notorious Evin P rison. Judicial authorities repeatedly violated Iran’s own laws by, among other things, holding the Post reporter for months — often in solitary confinement — before bringing charges, allowing him almost no pretrial contact with his defense lawyer, failing to inform him or his lawyer of the verdict or sentence after completion of a sham trial in August, and ignoring a deadline for release in the absence of a public conviction. Judicial authorities were adept, however, at making announcements or staging hearings during sensitive periods of the nuclear negotiations. One hearing was held the day before the completion of the final pact on July 14. Officials issued contradictory statements about the journalist’s status, sometimes declaring he had been convicted and sentenced on espionage charges and at other times saying the case was still open. The most honest explanation of his imprisonment came in media accounts that accused him of conspiring to improve relations between the United States and Iran, something that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has sworn to prevent. Mr. Rezaian’s release, and that of fellow Americans Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, is unlikely to alter that policy or Iran’s transgressions of international law. The International Atomic Energy Agency certified Saturday that Iran had complied with the initial requirements of the nuclear deal, including shipping 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium out of the country and putting thousands of centrifuges into storage. That allowed the government of Hassan Rouhani to gain access to tens of billions of dollars in frozen assets as well as the lifting of sanctions on the country’s banks and oil industry in advance of parliamentary elections next month. Since the accord was signed, however, Iran has twice violated a separate U.N. Security Council resolution prohibiting testing of long-range missiles. It continues to hold at least one American, businessman Siamak Namazi; another, former FBI agent Robert Levinson, remains missing. (Tehran separately released a detained American student Saturday). Possibly because of its interest in completing the prisoner swap, the Obama administration’s response has been weak: It withdrew the modest sanctions it had prepared in response to the missile launches. The Post and Mr. Rezaian’s family will celebrate his safe return and that of the other Americans. But in the absence of a firmer U.S. policy, Iran’s attacks on Americans and vital U.S. interests will surely continue.

1,"Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian and two other Americans released from an Iranian prison landed Sunday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany and were expected to be whisked immediately to the nearby U.S. military medical center at Landstuhl. Rezaian is accompanied by his mother and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, an Iranian who was allowed to leave the country with him. His brother, Ali Rezaian, and senior Post editors awaited his arrival in Germany. Executive editor Martin Baron said they had no information on when they would be allowed to see Rezaian. His family has said his health seriously deteriorated during his 18-month detention. “We’ll play it day by day, and make sure that whatever happens is what’s best for Jason, and what he wishes,” said Post Foreign Editor Douglas Jehl. “We’re eager to welcome him back to the Post family.” In a statement Sunday morning, President Obama said that all five Americans released had been “unjustly detained,” and in some cases faced long prison sentences in Iran. Those traveling with Rezaian included Saeed Abedini, an Idaho cleric, and former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati. All are U.S.-Iranian dual nationals. Little is known about a fourth released prisoner, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, who the administration said opted not to join the flight. A fifth American, student Matthew Trevithick, was separately released and left Iran on his own. Although the prisoners were released Saturday, the Swiss Air plane that was there to take them out of Iran was delayed many hours before takeoff. Administration officials said Obama waited to speak only after their departure was confirmed. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the delay was due to last-minute misunderstandings over whether Rezaian’s mother, Mary Rezaian, and his wife were on the flight manifest. The departure was also complicated by flight crew rest rules, he said. Mary Rezaian, who was in Iran while her son was put on trial on espionage and related charges, was not officially part of the agreement; she was placed on the plane manifest at the request of the Americans. Both she and Salehi were initially prohibited from boarding. Kerry said it required the intervention of Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who dispatched four aides to work through the “glitch” so the plane could leave as part of a carefully choreographed deal in which Obama offered clemency to seven Iranians. “Zarif had no question about it,” said Kerry during a 3:30 a.m. interview with four reporters traveling with him from Vienna, after the plane landed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. “It was part of the agreement; it was clearly stated. The problem was, one of the guys on the ground, at a military base, didn’t have it on the manifest."" Kerry said he told Zarif: “Javad, look, it’s part of the agreement. She’s on the list."" “He assigned four people to it immediately. Before I left and got on the plane, we had complete clarity. . . . She was going to go. It was just a glitch.” “I hope America wakes up to the news they are in the air and on their way,” Kerry said. The plane eventually departed at about 7 a.m., Washington time. Kerry said plans called for the freed Americans to be met in Geneva, their first stop, by Patrick Kennedy, the undersecretary of state for management, and Brett McGurk, the assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, who spent 14 months negotiating the prisoner deal. He said the complex arrangement, which also involved U.S. clemency for seven Iranians charged or convicted for violations of sanctions against Iran, was hammered out in a dozen meetings he held with Zarif in the months after a nuclear deal negotiated between world powers and Iran was finalized in July. The deal was formally implemented Saturday. Though Kerry and Zarif had discussed the imprisoned Americans on the sidelines of every nuclear negotiating session, he said, the focus turned exclusively to the prisoners during talks after the nuclear agreement was concluded. During their first face-to-face encounter after that landmark agreement, at a multi-national meeting in Vienna in November to discuss possible Syrian peace talks, Kerry believed they had resolved the prisoner issue as well. “We actually shook hands thinking we had an agreement,” he said. “I thought it was done."" But that was apparently blocked, Kerry said, by ""some folks back in Tehran in a different department. I don’t want identify it; I don’t want to embarrass people and cause problems. It was just one of those natural interagency, any government, differences. . . . So we went back to work grinding out that differential.” Kerry said the negotiations hit a snag over Iranian demands for its citizens held in the United States. Iranian officials initially said they wanted freedom for 19 prisoners, a number that eventually was whittled to seven, all but one of them holding dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship. “Iran asked for a lot of people,” Kerry said. “We said no. We said no, we said no, we said no to specific people they wanted until it became clear we were not going to let out hardened criminals, somebody accused of murder, of narcotics.” Kerry said Obama insisted that the only Iranians the United States would consider releasing were those convicted or charged with violating nuclear-related sanctions that were lifted Sunday as the nuclear agreement was implemented. “There was a symmetry here,” Kerry said. Not all the seven Iranian prisoners will return to Iran, Kerry said. That was determined by U.S. consular officials who visited them in person to ask their preferences, a task that was mirrored in Iran with visits to the American prisoners by consular officials from the Swiss Embassy that represents U.S. interests in Iran. Kerry said a written agreement ensures Iran will cooperate with U.S. officials investigating the whereabouts of Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007. Kerry said he has “no idea” if Levinson is alive or dead. Kerry said he spoke recently with Levinson’s wife, assuring her the United States will continue to search for him, and Iran has agreed to cooperate in that search.. “We are making our very best effort, taking the last information known regarding his whereabouts,” Kerry said. “He was absolutely part of every discussion.” Kerry said the United States also would continue negotiating with Iran over the release of Siamak Namazi, a Dubai-based U.S. citizen who was detained last fall. He is not part of the written agreement, however. Kerry said he had been confident the negotiations would succeed eventually. “I always believed we’d get there sometime,” he said. “But I couldn’t tell whether it was going to get super complicated by the insertion of this other agency and political dynamics into the mix. . . . But in the end, [Iran] worked hard and did the things yesterday they said they would do, and we did things.” Kerry said that he hopes that negotiations for the prisoner deal herald a new day when Iran and the United States can iron out their differences at the negotiating table, but he said there are no guarantees. “There are no other deals, no side deal to this,” he said. “Nothing is hidden here. What you see is what you get. People are out and free. We still have problems with Iran. None of this wipes away our concerns with Iran. We have to continue to work at those. But you have to start somewhere. And this is a beginning.”","Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian and two other Americans released from an Iranian prison landed Sunday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany and were expected to be whisked immediately to the nearby U.S. military medical center at Landstuhl. Rezaian is accompanied by his mother and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, an Iranian who was allowed to leave the country with him. His brother, Ali Rezaian, and senior Post editors awaited his arrival in Germany. Executive editor Martin Baron said they had no information on when they would be allowed to see Rezaian.

1,"President Obama on Sunday defended his historic nuclear accord with Iran as proof that “smart, patient and disciplined” diplomacy can improve relations with a longtime foe, even as his administration announced new sanctions related to Tehran’s ­ballistic-missile program. His declaration followed the lifting of many of the harshest international economic sanctions against Iran and confirmation that Iranian authorities had freed imprisoned Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and four other Americans. The president’s remarks Sunday at the White House capped a dramatic two-day stretch that highlighted the complex and uncertain nature of the United States’ new relationship with one of its oldest and most determined enemies. Obama’s critics have pilloried the nuclear deal, casting it as a capitulation to Iran’s ruling clerics and evidence of the president’s weakness on the world stage. Obama discussed the deal in a tone more sober than celebratory and acknowledged that “profound differences” remain between the two countries. “The United States has never been afraid to pursue diplomacy with our adversaries,” he said, citing the examples of past presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. He spoke directly to young Iranians, holding out hope that his administration’s milestone foreign policy achievement could open up a pathway to a broader accord between two longtime foes. “We have a rare chance to pursue a new path — a different, better future that delivers progress for both our people and the wider world,” he said. “That’s the opportunity for the Iranian people. We need to take advantage of that.” Even as Obama spoke optimistically of a new era, there were reminders that the relationship between the United States and Iran remains dangerous and fraught. Once the flight with the former prisoners was on its way, the ­administration announced new sanctions related to participation in Iran’s ballistic-missile program. The measures apply to only 11 individuals and companies and are separate from the international sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program that were lifted Saturday. Iran’s effort to develop ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead “poses a significant threat to regional and global security, and it will continue to be subject to international sanctions,” said Adam J. Szubin, the acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence in the Treasury Department. Some in Congress have criticized Obama for not moving more swiftly to sanction Iran for its missile violations. Obama highlighted the ongoing tensions between Iran and the United States. “We remain steadfast in opposing Iran’s de­stabilizing behavior elsewhere,” Obama said, “including its threats against Israel and our gulf partners, and its support for violent proxies in places like Syria and Yemen.” In a statement carried by Reuters on Monday, Iran’s Foreign Ministry replied that the “Islamic Republic will respond to these aggravating and propagandistic measures by pursuing its legal missile program stronger than before and developing its defensive capabilities.”  Obama also spoke of Robert Levinson, an American who has been missing in Iran for eight years. Levinson’s whereabouts are not known, and it is unclear whether he is still alive. A former FBI agent, Levinson was sent to Iran by CIA officials who were not authorized to manage overseas operations. Obama said Iran has agreed to “deepen coordination” as the United States works to find Levinson and reunite him with his wife and children. “We will never forget about Bob,” Obama said, adding that “we will not rest until their family is whole again.” The president focused on new opportunities rather than dwelling on existing tensions. He praised the return of the Americans and the broader nuclear accord with Iran as proof of the United States’ influence in the world and the power of diplomacy. “These things are a reminder of what we can achieve when we lead with strength and with wisdom, with courage and resolve and patience,” Obama said. “America can do — and has done — big things when we work together.” He cast his approach as a better alternative to the more bellicose path of his Republican critics, who have blasted him for his caution and reluctance to confront Iran’s ruling clerics more forcefully. The nuclear agreement and the release of the American prisoners were negotiated separately to ensure that the detainees were not used as leverage, U.S. officials said. But the completion of the nuclear deal last summer helped accelerate the talks about the prisoners, which loomed in the background of the negotiations. The Americans were freed in exchange for U.S. clemency in the cases of seven Iranians charged or imprisoned over sanctions violations, and the dismissal of outstanding charges against 14 Iranians outside the United States. At least five of the Iranians granted pardons or sentence commutations intend to stay in the United States, their attorneys said. Iran confirmed the release of Rezaian and the other American detainees just hours before diplomats in Vienna announced that Iran had fulfilled its promises under the nuclear accord. The accord frees Iran from crippling sanctions and potentially offers a pathway for ending the country’s decades-long economic and diplomatic isolation. The United States also agreed to pay Iran $1.7 billion to settle a 35-year-old claim on payments for military equipment the United States refused to deliver after the 1979 revolution and hostage crisis in Tehran. The money has been tied up in a trust fund and in litigation at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague. U.S. officials cast the settlement as a less-risky alternative to fighting it out with Iran in court, where the United States could have been forced to pay billions more in penalties. The big question for Obama and his successor is whether the United States and Iran can build on their fledgling relationship. The long and often-tense negotiations between Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also have opened up a channel for the United States to keep talking with its longtime foe. Obama said that relationship was essential to freeing American sailors taken captive by Iran last week when U.S. officials said they accidentally sailed into Iranian waters. The sailors’ capture “could have sparked an international incident,” he said. Instead, U.S. and Iranian officials were able to resolve the situation in 24 hours. The main forum for openings between the two countries going forward will be as part of long-shot peace talks to settle Syria’s bloody civil war. Iran has played a critical role in helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad cling to power and will be essential to any deal to replace Assad and end the four-year-old war. The nuclear deal also carries significant risks for Obama, who has touted the deal as among the most significant foreign policy achievements of his presidency. Iran could use its $50­­ billion to $100 billion windfall from the nuclear accord to step up its support for terrorist groups and sow greater disorder in the Middle East. Big questions also remain about Iran’s willingness to live up to its obligations under the accord, including an unprecedented inspections program. Israel’s government and members of Congress have condemned the deal as caving in to the demands of Iran’s clerical rulers and have said it doesn’t do enough to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Obama insisted that the accord with Iran provides no room for its ruling clerics to cheat. “If they try to build a bomb covertly, we will catch them,” he said. In recent weeks, Iran has shipped 98 percent of its nuclear fuel out of the country, mothballed thousands of centrifuges used for enriching uranium and destroyed the core of a major nuclear reactor. Instead of being two to three months from acquiring enough fissile material to build a nuclear weapon, Obama said, it is now a year away. Obama waited to speak Sunday until the American prisoners held by Iran had cleared Iranian airspace. After the plane arrived in Germany, Obama telephoned Rezaian’s brother, Ali Rezaian, at Landstuhl medical center. In a call that lasted about two minutes, Obama told Ali that his brother’s detention had lasted “too long” and that he hoped Ali would be able to see him soon. Rezaian and the other Americans were moved directly into the hospital for medical checks. Ali met with his mother, Mary, and Rezaian’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who had left Tehran on the plane with Rezaian and two of the other freed Americans. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, and Douglas Jehl, the foreign editor, also met briefly with Salehi and Mary Rezaian and spoke briefly on the phone with Rezaian, who was calling from the hospital. Asked how he was doing, Rezaian told The Post’s editors, “I’m a hell of a lot better than I was 48 hours ago.” He said that he found escape in the fiction he was allowed to read, and on Sunday he was avidly reading whatever he wanted, including stories about his captivity and release. He said it was strange to see himself being talked about so much, and the two Post editors replied that they “had been talking about him for 545 days.” The support of The Post “means everything,” Rezaian told Baron and Jehl. Obama had been harshly criticized for not making the prisoners’ release a precondition of the nuclear accord, and their freedom offered the president a measure of vindication. In the White House, Obama read off each of their names and offered words of praise for their work in Iran. He described Rezaian as a “courageous journalist” who “embodies the brave spirit that gives life to the freedom of the press.” Saeed Abedini, a pastor from Idaho held for more than three years, had displayed “unyielding faith” that had inspired people around the world to fight for religious freedom, Obama said. Even critics of the nuclear accord and his outreach to Iran should be willing to celebrate their release, Obama said. “Today, we’re united in welcoming home sons and husbands and brothers who, in lonely prison cells, have endured an absolute nightmare,” Obama said. “But they never gave in, and they never gave up.” William Branigin and Carol Morello in Washington and Andrew Roth in Landstuhl, Germany, contributed to this report.","President Obama on Sunday defended his historic nuclear accord with Iran as proof that “smart, patient and disciplined” diplomacy can improve relations with a longtime foe, even as his administration announced new sanctions related to Tehran’s ­ballistic-missile program.

1,"LANDSTUHL, Germany — A plane carrying Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian and two other Americans released by Iran landed in Germany on Sunday, a day after the implementation of a landmark agreement on Iran’s nuclear program. In a brief phone call with the Washington Post‘s executive editor, Martin Baron, and the foreign editor, Douglas Jehl, from a U.S. military hospital in Germany, Rezaian said that he was feeling well both physically and mentally and was looking forward to being reunited with friends and family soon after undergoing medical tests. Rezaian, who was released after 545 days in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, said that the support of his family and colleagues during his incarceration had “meant everything.” Asked how he was feeling, he added: “I’m a hell of a lot better than I was 48 hours ago.” Once the Americans had left Iran aboard a Swiss aircraft, the Obama administration announced new sanctions related to participation in Iran’s ballistic missile program. The sanctions, which applied to 11 persons and companies, were issued under U.S. restrictions that remain in place despite the lifting Saturday of international sanctions tied to Iran’s nuclear program. The Swiss plane landed in Geneva for a brief stopover before the Americans were flown to Germany for medical checkups at a U.S. military hospital. They landed at Ramstein Air Base shortly before 2 p.m. EST and were taken to the U.S. military’s nearby Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. While the freed Americans were airborne, President Obama hailed the implementation of the nuclear agreement and the prisoner deal with Iran that led to their release. In televised remarks Sunday morning from the White House, he said that although “profound differences” remain between Washington and Tehran, the Iranian people now have a chance to end their isolation and “begin building new ties with the world.” After the Americans arrived in Germany, Obama telephoned Ali Rezaian, Jason’s brother, who had arrived ahead of time in Landstuhl. Ali Rezaian said Obama told him that his brother’s detention had lasted “too long.” In a call that lasted about two minutes, the president also said he hoped that Ali would be able to see Jason soon. Ali Rezaian was not immediately able to see his brother but was able to speak to him on the phone. The three freed Americans were moved directly into the hospital for medical checks. Ali Rezaian was able to greet his mother, Mary Rezaian, and Jason’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who left Tehran on the Swiss plane. In the telephone call with the Post’s editors, Rezaian said that isolation was the most difficult part of his time in prison. Still, snippets of information had made it back to him, lamong them that his Christmas greetings conveyed via his mother from prison had “made the rounds and reached everybody, which is what I intended.” He also said that he found escape in the novels that he was allowed to read while in prison facing trial for spying. Rezaian’s health was reported to have suffered from poor conditions at the prison and a lack of medicine for his high blood pressure. Family members earlier this year said that he had lost weight and suffered from back pain, and chronic eye and groin infections. He told the editors in the early Monday phone call that his health had improved in the last several months. He is expected to face a battery of medical tests in the coming days, and it is not yet clear how long he will spend at the military hospital in Landstuhl. In Tehran, President Hassan Rouhani told the Iranian parliament that the end of nuclear-related sanctions marks a “turning point” for the country. He later proclaimed in a news conference that financial institutions in Iran would be able to reengage “the banks of the world for financial and monetary purposes.” U.S. and European officials lifted the harshest economic sanctions against Tehran after the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog certified that the Islamic republic had fully complied with promises to curtail key parts of its nuclear program. Hours before diplomats in Vienna heralded the official activation of the nuclear deal, Iran confirmed the release of Rezaian and the other American detainees, set free in exchange for U.S. clemency offered to seven Iranians charged or imprisoned for sanctions violations and the dismissal of outstanding charges against 14 Iranians outside the United States. The Post journalist boarded the flight to freedom Sunday after 18 months of captivity in Evin Prison, used for decades by both Iran’s Islamic revolutionary government and the monarchy it overthrew in 1979 to incarcerate — and, human rights groups say, abuse — political prisoners. He was tried in secret last year on charges including espionage and sentenced to an unspecified prison term. Also on the plane were two other freed Iranian Americans — Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati. The plane left after an overnight delay stemming from what U.S. officials said was a misunderstanding among Iranian officials at the airport about the passenger manifest — specifically, whether Salehi and Mary Rezaian were supposed to be on the plane. One of four Americans who were freed in the prisoner deal, Nosratollah ­Khosravi-Roodsari, did not fly out with the others, U.S. officials said. “We can confirm that our detained U.S. citizens have been released and that those who wished to depart Iran have left,” a senior administration official said. “We have no further information to share at this time and would ask that everyone respect the privacy of these individuals and their families.” A fifth American was released in a separate gesture by Iran and left Iran individually before the plane carrying the three Americans departed. In his remarks Sunday from the Cabinet Room of the White House, Obama spoke of the ordeals suffered by the detained Americans. He called Rezaian “a courageous journalist . . . who wrote about the daily lives and hopes of the Iranian people,” adding: “He embodies the brave spirit that gives life to the freedom of the press.” Obama said Iran “has agreed to deepen our coordination” in trying to locate former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who disappeared while visiting Iran’s Kish Island in 2007. The seven Iranians being granted clemency in the deal “were not charged with terrorism or any violent offenses,” the president said. He described their release as “a one-time gesture to Iran” that reflects U.S. willingness to engage with the country “to advance our mutual interests.” Although Iranian officials characterized the arrangement as an “exchange,” none of the seven who were granted clemency — six Iranian Americans and one with solely Iranian citizenship — were handed over to Iran, as in a traditional prisoner swap. Instead, U.S. officials said, they were free to decide individually whether to go to Iran. At least five have chosen not to go, according to their lawyers. Calling a recent missile test by Iran a “violation of its international obligations,” Obama said the United States as a result “is imposing sanctions on individuals and companies working to advance Iran’s ballistic missile program.” The Treasury Department said the new sanctions apply to, among others, the Mabrooka Trading Co., based in the United Arab Emirates, and its networks based in that Persian Gulf country and in China. It said they have used front companies to deceive foreign suppliers about the true end-users of “sensitive goods for missile proliferation.” Saturday’s coordinated moves to implement the nuclear deal and free prisoners cemented a major diplomatic victory for the Obama administration, which won significant nuclear concessions from Iran in an effort to defuse an international crisis that threatened to spark a new Middle East war. The agreement also frees Iran from crippling economic sanctions and opens the way for ending decades of diplomatic and economic isolation. But the agreement also contains significant political risk for a White House that is staking its legacy on Iran’s willingness to comply with unprecedented curbs and extensive monitoring of its nuclear program. The pact — which has been repeatedly condemned by the Israeli government as well as by members of Congress from both parties — drew fresh attacks over the weekend from Republican presidential contenders, some of whom blasted the deal as a sellout to Iran’s clerical rulers. In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his concern over Iran’s pivot away from international isolation. He asserted that Iranian leaders still harbor a desire to build atomic weapons but did not offer evidence to support that claim. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate political and religious authority in the Shiite Muslim theocracy, has said Iran does not want or need nuclear weapons, which he has declared to be forbidden by Islam. “Even after the signing of the nuclear agreement, Iran has not relinquished its aspiration to obtain nuclear weapons,and it will continue to undermine stability in the Middle East and spread terrorism around the world while violating its international obligations,” Netanyahu said. “Israel will continue to monitor the situation and warn about Iran’s negative activity, and will do everything necessary to safeguard its security and defend itself,” he said. Saudi Arabia and other Arab opponents of Iran refrained from issuing such critical responses. But officials in Riyadh are deeply skeptical of the nuclear agreement: they fear that with billions of dollars of assets unfrozen by the accord, Tehran will be able to greatly expand its influence across the region. In the Saudis’ view, such a development could affect the conflicts in Yemen, Syria and other countries where Saudi Arabia and Iran — fierce ideological and strategic rivals — use proxies to compete for influence. The nuclear pact calls on Iran to disable key nuclear equipment in a deal designed to ensure that the country cannot accumulate enough fissile material to build a nuclear bomb. The agreement also requires unprecedented inspections and monitoring covering all aspects of Iran’s nuclear program, from uranium mining to research facilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter that “diplomacy requires patience, but we all know that it sure beats the alternatives.” Implementation of the deal, Zarif said, meant that “it’s now time for all — especially Muslim nations — to join hands and rid the world of violent extremism. Iran is ready.” The release of prisoners had not been officially part of negotiations between Iran and the six world powers: the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. But Kerry frequently raised the plight of imprisoned U.S. citizens during last year’s nuclear talks. The Obama administration had come under heavy criticism for concluding the nuclear accord without winning the release of American detainees, including Rezaian, 39, whose 544-day detention was the longest for a Western journalist in Iran. White House officials confirmed that the prisoner deal was clinched during months of secret talks that gained momentum in the days before the nuclear pact was formally implemented Saturday. “Friends and colleagues at The Washington Post are elated by the wonderful news that Jason Rezaian has been released from Evin Prison and has safely left the country with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi,” said Frederick J. Ryan Jr., publisher of The Post. “We are enormously grateful to all who played a role in securing his release. Our deep appreciation also goes to the many government leaders, journalists, human rights advocates and others around the world who have spoken out on Jason’s behalf and against the harsh confinement that was so wrongly imposed upon him,” he said. “Now a free man, Jason will be reunited with his family, including his brother Ali, his most effective and tireless advocate. We look forward to the joyous occasion of welcoming him back to the Washington Post newsroom,” Ryan said. In addition to Rezaian, the Americans freed Saturday included Abedini, 35, of Boise, Idaho; Hekmati, 32, of Flint, Mich.; and Khosravi-Roodsari. A fifth American, identified as language student Matt Trevithick, was also released Saturday but was not part of the prisoner deal. Trevithick’s parents said in a statement that he had been held for 40 days in Evin Prison. A senior U.S. official said Trevithick, 30, left Iran on Saturday. Abedini is a Christian pastor who had been imprisoned since July 2012 for organizing home churches. Hekmati is a former Marine who spent more than four years in prison on spying charges following his arrest in August 2011 during a visit to see his grandmother. The detention of Khosravi-Roodsari had not been previously publicized. Iranian state television identified him as a businessman. Little else was known about him. The arrangement quickly became political fodder in the United States among Republicans vying for the GOP presidential nomination. In an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said: “This deal is a very problematic deal, and it represents a pattern we’ve seen in the Obama administration over and over again of negotiating with terrorists.” He added: “I think it’s a very dangerous precedent because the result of this — every bad actor on Earth has been told: ‘Go capture an American.’ If you want to get terrorists out of jail, capture an American and President Obama is in the let’s-make-a-deal business.” Republican front-runner Donald Trump said in a television interview that aired Sunday morning: “This should have happened years ago. . . . We’re giving them $150 billion. This shouldn’t be happening now. And I understand that in addition to the $150 billion, they’re getting hostages, also, or they’re getting some prisoners released. So I have to see what the deal is.” Under the nuclear deal, Iran is recovering about $50 billion of its money that has been frozen in banks overseas, mostly in Asia, U.S. officials said. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that she was “pleased, like I hope everybody is, that we have American citizens coming home this morning from Iran.” She said she had done “a lot of work on these issues” when she was secretary of state. But Clinton said that “we have unfinished questions and business still” because of the disappearance of Levinson. “I think this is a part of what we’re going to be pursuing — persistent, patient diplomacy,” Clinton said.

In a brief phone call with the Washington Post‘s executive editor, Martin Baron, and the foreign editor, Douglas Jehl, from a U.S. military hospital in Germany, Rezaian said that he was feeling well both physically and mentally and was looking forward to being reunited with friends and family soon after undergoing medical tests. Rezaian, who was released after 545 days in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, said that the support of his family and colleagues during his incarceration had “meant everything.” Asked how he was feeling, he added: “I’m a hell of a lot better than I was 48 hours ago.” Once the Americans had left Iran aboard a Swiss aircraft, the Obama administration announced new sanctions related to participation in Iran’s ballistic missile program. The sanctions, which applied to 11 persons and companies, were issued under U.S. restrictions that remain in place despite the lifting Saturday of international sanctions tied to Iran’s nuclear program. The Swiss plane landed in Geneva for a brief stopover before the Americans were flown to Germany for medical checkups at a U.S. military hospital. They landed at Ramstein Air Base shortly before 2 p.m. EST and were taken to the U.S. military’s nearby Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. While the freed Americans were airborne, President Obama hailed the implementation of the nuclear agreement and the prisoner deal with Iran that led to their release. In televised remarks Sunday morning from the White House, he said that although “profound differences” remain between Washington and Tehran, the Iranian people now have a chance to end their isolation and “begin building new ties with the world.” After the Americans arrived in Germany, Obama telephoned Ali Rezaian, Jason’s brother, who had arrived ahead of time in Landstuhl. Ali Rezaian said Obama told him that his brother’s detention had lasted “too long.” In a call that lasted about two minutes, the president also said he hoped that Ali would be able to see Jason soon. Ali Rezaian was not immediately able to see his brother but was able to speak to him on the phone. The three freed Americans were moved directly into the hospital for medical checks. Ali Rezaian was able to greet his mother, Mary Rezaian, and Jason’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who left Tehran on the Swiss plane. In the telephone call with the Post’s editors, Rezaian said that isolation was the most difficult part of his time in prison. Still, snippets of information had made it back to him, lamong them that his Christmas greetings conveyed via his mother from prison had “made the rounds and reached everybody, which is what I intended.” He also said that he found escape in the novels that he was allowed to read while in prison facing trial for spying.

1,"President Obama offered clemency to seven Iranians charged with violating U.S. trade sanctions against Iran as part of a historic prisoner agreement with Iran that freed four Americans Saturday, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. The Iranians, six of whom are dual U.S.-Iranian citizens, were imprisoned or were awaiting trial in the United States. The U.S. government dismissed charges against 14 other Iranians, all outside the United States, after assessing that extradition requests were unlikely to be successful, according to a U.S. official. The official also said that Iran has committed to continue cooperating with the United States to determine the location of retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, who disappeared in Iran more than nine years ago. Iran’s semiofficial Fars News Agency released names of the seven individuals. The Department of Justice declined to confirm their identities. Joel Androphy, an attorney for one of the Iranians — Bahram Mechanic — said his client was offered a full pardon. Androphy also worked closely with the attorneys for two of the other men who were pardoned, Tooraj “Roger” Faridi and Khosrow Afghahi. The three men are Iranian American businessmen who were indicted last year and accused of illegally exporting microelectronics to Iran that could aid the country’s nuclear program. “They’re ecstatic,” said Androphy. He said the men were told Wednesday that Obama was pardoning them. Mechanic and Afghahi were being held without bail in a federal detention facility in Houston. Faridi, who lives in Houston, was not in custody, Androphy said. The released Iranians were on a long list that Tehran initially gave the U.S. government early in the negotiations, a list eventually whittled down to the seven, according to a senior U.S. official who briefed reporters under a condition of anonymity set by the administration. The official said Obama insisted that none of the individuals be “people who have been prosecuted for offenses related to terrorism . . . or violent crime.” All, the official said, were convicted or accused of “crimes related to violating our trade embargo or sanctions.” The April 2015 indictment against Mechanic, Faridi and Afghahi, for violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, alleges that the men and their Houston-based company, Smart Power Systems, were members of an Iranian procurement network operating in the United States. The men, who pleaded not guilty and said their business consisted of buying parts in other countries to build surge protectors for computers, were charged as part of a larger scheme involving individuals and companies in Turkey and Taiwan. They had not yet gone to trial. “They feel victimized by the government,” Androphy said. “People should be happy that both countries did the right thing by releasing people that were unfairly confined.” He said his clients were “victims of disputes between countries, not people who’ve committed any horrific crimes.” Androphy said his clients, who were born in Iran and naturalized more than five years ago, are now free to travel and would remain in the United States with their families. Mechanic will drop his lawsuit against the United States for unlawfully seizing his business in Tehran, and he plans to travel to Iran to continue his business there, Androphy said. Another Iranian who is part of the deal is Nader Modanlo, a Montgomery County businessman who prosecutors said used his aerospace expertise and connections with Russia to help Iran launch a satellite for the first time. Modanlo, a U.S. citizen born in Iran and living in Potomac, was sentenced in 2013 to eight years in prison for conspiring to illegally provide satellite-related services to Iran, in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Iran trade embargo. Modanlo, then 52, was also convicted of money-laundering and obstruction of bankruptcy proceedings. Maryland U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein said at the time that, partly as a result of Modanlo’s actions, an Iranian Earth-observation satellite equipped with a camera was launched into space from Russia on Oct. 27, 2005. “Modanlo violated the law by helping Iran launch communications satellites,” Rosenstein said. A jury convicted Modanlo, finding that he illegally facilitated a satellite deal between Iran and Russia and received a $10 million brokering fee. “Mr. Modanlo has been fighting to clear his name for nearly a decade,” Modanlo’s attorney, Lucius Outlaw III, said after the trial in federal court in Greenbelt. “Unfortunately, the fight will have to continue.” Also in 2013, Rosenstein announced that Ali Saboonchi, then 32, a U.S. citizen living in Parkville, Md., had been indicted on charges of conspiring to export and exporting U.S.-manufactured industrial products and services to Iran. In a five-count indictment, Saboonchi, who has been imprisoned in Petersburg, Va., was charged with creating a business, Ace Electric, for the purpose of obtaining goods to be sent to Iran. An attorney now representing Modanlo, Kelly Kramer, declined to comment. Outlaw, who now represents Saboonchi, said in an e-mail about 6 a.m. Sunday that Saboonchi has been released. He and another attorney, Elizabeth Oyer, said in a statement: ""Ali Saboonchi is a beloved and hard-working family man and American. He was born in the U.S. and is proud to be raising his young family here. His arrest and incarceration were devastating to his many friends and family. Ali is thrilled and grateful for his release and return to his family. Ali's release shows that he poses no danger to the American people. He has a bright future ahead."" Another Iranian national who was granted clemency is Nima Golestaneh, 30, who pleaded guilty in December to charges of wire fraud and unauthorized access to computers related to the October 2012 hacking of a Vermont-based engineering consulting and software company. Golestaneh conspired with others to hack the network and computers at Arrow Tech Associates to steal company software and business information, according to the plea agreement. Golestaneh acquired servers in other countries for his co-conspirators to use remotely to launch computer intrusions into companies, including Arrow Tech. The seventh Iranian is Arash Ghahreman, 45, a naturalized U.S. citizen and former Iranian national who was convicted in April by a federal jury in San Diego of violations of U.S. export and money-laundering laws linked to his involvement in a scheme to purchase marine navigation equipment and military electronic equipment for illegal export to Iran. “The defendants used a front company to illegally send U.S. goods and technologies, including those used in military applications to Iran,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin said after the conviction. Ellis M. Johnston III, Ghahreman's attorney, said Ghahreman was released from a federal prison camp about 6 a.m. Sunday. Johnston said Ghahreman — who was not pardoned but had his sentence commuted — plans to spend some time with his aunt and her family on the East Coast, reunite with his girlfriend on the West Coast and ""hopefully visit his elderly parents in Iran, whom he hasn't seen in years since this case began."" ""Mr. Ghahreman and his family are extremely relieved by his release,"" Johnston said in an email. ""For my part, I'm obviously happy for Mr Ghahreman's release; he's a very kind, considerate man who poses no threat to the United States and who, if given the chance despite his felony conviction (which still stands because he wasn't pardoned; his sentence was only commuted), will succeed professionally here, abroad, or wherever he chooses."" The attorneys for Ghahreman, Saboonchi and Mechanic said Sunday they were still sorting out what they were going to do following their release early Sunday. But the attorneys said the three men have put down roots in the United States and likely would stay. Oyer, Saboonchi’s attorney, said her client has a wife and young son in the Parkville area and that he would likely want to complete a PhD program in electrical engineering that he began at Morgan State University before he was arrested. She said Saboonchi’s sentence was commuted ,and she was unsure how that affected the felony conviction on his record. Androphy said Mechanic intends to go back to work for his Houston-based company Smart Power, though he noted that Mechanic also has a company in Iran. Johnston said his client, Ghahreman, is “a U.S. citizen who has lived and worked in the U.S. for the last decade and most recently obtained a masters degree from SUNY Maritime College just before his trial began. So he does have strong ties to this country, a strong work history as a project manager in shipyards, and hopefully can continue to find opportunities here in the U.S. despite his felony conviction.”     Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Houston lawyer Joel Androphy represented Bahram Mechanic, Tooraj “Roger” Faridi and Khosrow Afghahi. Androphy represents only Mechanic.

The official said Obama insisted that none of the individuals be “people who have been prosecuted for offenses related to terrorism . . . or violent crime.” All, the official said, were convicted or accused of “crimes related to violating our trade embargo or sanctions.” The April 2015 indictment against Mechanic, Faridi and Afghahi, for violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, alleges that the men and their Houston-based company, Smart Power Systems, were members of an Iranian procurement network operating in the United States. The men, who pleaded not guilty and said their business consisted of buying parts in other countries to build surge protectors for computers, were charged as part of a larger scheme involving individuals and companies in Turkey and Taiwan. They had not yet gone to trial. “They feel victimized by the government,” Androphy said. “People should be happy that both countries did the right thing by releasing people that were unfairly confined.” He said his clients were “victims of disputes between countries, not people who’ve committed any horrific crimes.” Androphy said his clients, who were born in Iran and naturalized more than five years ago, are now free to travel and would remain in the United States with their families. Mechanic will drop his lawsuit against the United States for unlawfully seizing his business in Tehran, and he plans to travel to Iran to continue his business there, Androphy said. Another Iranian who is part of the deal is Nader Modanlo, a Montgomery County businessman who prosecutors said used his aerospace expertise and connections with Russia to help Iran launch a satellite for the first time. Modanlo, a U.S. citizen born in Iran and living in Potomac, was sentenced in 2013 to eight years in prison for conspiring to illegally provide satellite-related services to Iran, in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Iran trade embargo. Modanlo, then 52, was also convicted of money-laundering and obstruction of bankruptcy proceedings. Maryland U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein said at the time that, partly as a result of Modanlo’s actions, an Iranian Earth-observation satellite equipped with a camera was launched into space from Russia on Oct. 27, 2005. “Modanlo violated the law by helping Iran launch communications satellites,” Rosenstein said. A jury convicted Modanlo, finding that he illegally facilitated a satellite deal between Iran and Russia and received a $10 million brokering fee. “Mr. Modanlo has been fighting to clear his name for nearly a decade,” Modanlo’s attorney, Lucius Outlaw III, said after the trial in federal court in Greenbelt. “Unfortunately, the fight will have to continue.” Also in 2013, Rosenstein announced that Ali Saboonchi, then 32, a U.S. citizen living in Parkville, Md., had been indicted on charges of conspiring to export and exporting U.S.-manufactured industrial products and services to Iran. In a five-count indictment, Saboonchi, who has been imprisoned in Petersburg, Va., was charged with creating a business, Ace Electric, for the purpose of obtaining goods to be sent to Iran. An attorney now representing Modanlo, Kelly Kramer, declined to comment. Outlaw, who now represents Saboonchi, said in an e-mail about 6 a.m. Sunday that Saboonchi has been released. He and another attorney, Elizabeth Oyer, said in a statement: ""Ali Saboonchi is a beloved and hard-working family man and American. He was born in the U.S. and is proud to be raising his young family here. His arrest and incarceration were devastating to his many friends and family. Ali is thrilled and grateful for his release and return to his family. Ali's release shows that he poses no danger to the American people. He has a bright future ahead."" Another Iranian national who was granted clemency is Nima Golestaneh, 30, who pleaded guilty in December to charges of wire fraud and unauthorized access to computers related to the October 2012 hacking of a Vermont-based engineering consulting and software company. Golestaneh conspired with others to hack the network and computers at Arrow Tech Associates to steal company software and business information, according to the plea agreement. Golestaneh acquired servers in other countries for his co-conspirators to use remotely to launch computer intrusions into companies, including Arrow Tech. The seventh Iranian is Arash Ghahreman, 45, a naturalized U.S. citizen and former Iranian national who was convicted in April by a federal jury in San Diego of violations of U.S. export and money-laundering laws linked to his involvement in a scheme to purchase marine navigation equipment and military electronic equipment for illegal export to Iran. “The defendants used a front company to illegally send U.S. goods and technologies, including those used in military applications to Iran,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin said after the conviction. Ellis M. Johnston III, Ghahreman's attorney, said Ghahreman was released from a federal prison camp about 6 a.m. Sunday. Johnston said Ghahreman — who was not pardoned but had his sentence commuted — plans to spend some time with his aunt and her family on the East Coast, reunite with his girlfriend on the West Coast and ""hopefully visit his elderly parents in Iran, whom he hasn't seen in years since this case began."" ""Mr. Ghahreman and his family are extremely relieved by his release,"" Johnston said in an email. ""For my part, I'm obviously happy for Mr Ghahreman's release; he's a very kind, considerate man who poses no threat to the United States and who, if given the chance despite his felony conviction (which still stands because he wasn't pardoned; his sentence was only commuted), will succeed professionally here, abroad, or wherever he chooses."" The attorneys for Ghahreman, Saboonchi and Mechanic said Sunday they were still sorting out what they were going to do following their release early Sunday. But the attorneys said the three men have put down roots in the United States and likely would stay. Oyer, Saboonchi’s attorney, said her client has a wife and young son in the Parkville area and that he would likely want to complete a PhD program in electrical engineering that he began at Morgan State University before he was arrested. She said Saboonchi’s sentence was commuted ,and she was unsure how that affected the felony conviction on his record. Androphy said Mechanic intends to go back to work for his Houston-based company Smart Power, though he noted that Mechanic also has a company in Iran. Johnston said his client, Ghahreman, is “a U.S. citizen who has lived and worked in the U.S. for the last decade and most recently obtained a masters degree from SUNY Maritime College just before his trial began. So he does have strong ties to this country, a strong work history as a project manager in shipyards, and hopefully can continue to find opportunities here in the U.S. despite his felony conviction.”     Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Houston lawyer Joel Androphy represented Bahram Mechanic, Tooraj “Roger” Faridi and Khosrow Afghahi. Androphy represents only Mechanic.  Karen DeYoung and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report."
0,"BAGHDAD — U.S. and Iraqi authorities are searching for three Americans reported missing from a neighborhood in Iraq’s capital, Baghdad, officials said Sunday. At least one report said the Americans had been kidnapped by gunmen, but it could not immediately be confirmed. “We are aware of reports that American citizens are missing in Iraq,” said John Kirby, a State Department spokesman. “The safety and security of American citizens overseas is our highest priority. We are working with the full cooperation of the Iraqi authorities to locate and recover the individuals. Due to privacy considerations, I have nothing further.” A senior Iraqi security official told CNN that the Americans, apparently contractors, had gone missing two days ago. A spokesman for Baghdad’s Joint Operations Command said Sunday that the three missing persons were Iraqis who had become U.S. citizens. That information also could not be confirmed. A report from the pan-Arab satellite channel al-Arabiya said “militias” had abducted the group in the area of Dora in the city’s south. Other reports said they had ben seized in an apartment. Both Sunni and Shiite militants are present in the Iraqi capital, but Shiite militias operate as powerful auxiliary forces. Many of those militias are backed by Iran. Some analysts who closely follow Iran and its regional proxies suggested Sunday that the abduction of American citizens in Baghdad, if true, may have been a projection of Iranian power, in particular by hard-liners who opposed the prisoner deal with the United States over the weekend. Iran released four Iranian Americans with dual citizenship who were being held in Iranian prisons; the United States offered clemency to seven Iranians charged or imprisoned for sanctions violations. American authorities also dismissed charges against 14 Iranians outside the United States.

1,"It’s a long trip from Tehran, but it won’t really end when three Americans released from Iranian prisons over the weekend touch down in the United States. It may be months before they can reclaim the freedom to live an ordinary life, before they feel as if they are truly at home again. Journalists, diplomats and others who have been held overseas have suffered sleeplessness, nightmares and illnesses induced by their imprisonment. They have confronted the inevitable choices about whether to seek privacy or accept publicity. For the prisoners released Saturday, those questions will be complicated by a heated presidential campaign. And then there are the little things. Joshua Fattal, an American who was arrested by Iranian officials while hiking near the border between Iraq and Iran and who spent two years in captivity, recalled moving into his first apartment after his release in 2011. He promptly lost his keys. “I wasn’t allowed to touch keys for a long time,” he explained. How individuals respond to captivity varies widely, said Frank Ochberg, a psychiatrist at Michigan State University and a leading figure in research on traumatic stress. “I don’t think we really know why one person is more emotionally and physically resilient than somebody else,” he said. For those leaving prison, a comprehensive medical checkup is crucial, Ochberg said. Poor nutrition, unsanitary conditions and environmental toxins in prison can combine with stress to produce or exacerbate a range of medical conditions, such as diabetes, infections, thyroid disorders, circulatory problems, multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease. Three of the American prisoners leaving Iran — Jason Rezaian, a correspondent for The Washington Post; Saeed Abedini, an evangelical pastor; and Amir Hekmati, a former Marine — arrived in Germany on Sunday afternoon, where they were receiving medical attention at a U.S. military hospital. A fourth prisoner, student Matt Trevithick, was released and left the country separately. A fifth American, Nosratollah ­Khosravi-Roodsari, was also released but chose to remain in Iran. In general, Ochberg said, seeing a psychologist isn’t always necessary, especially for the former prisoners who have family and close friends to return to and a sense of purpose in their professional lives. That isn’t to say that acclimating to freedom is easy. Roxana Saberi, a journalist imprisoned in Iran in 2009, had a habit of looking over her shoulder when she first returned to the United States. While she was in prison, the Iranians had demanded that she spy for them once she was released. It took her some time to shake the feeling that they would kidnap her and imprison her again because she was not cooperating. “Those captors were very good at putting that fear in my head, that they could find me wherever I was,” Saberi said. “It’s not a fear that’s based in reality. It’s just that some of those fears are, kind of, ingrained in my psyche.” Like Rezaian, Saberi had been living and reporting in Iran when she was arrested, accused of espionage and locked up in Evin Prison. An appellate court ordered her release, and she was freed after spending 100 days in captivity. Back at home, she couldn’t sleep at times. “I had nightmares that people were coming for me, because I was taken from my apartment in Tehran,” she said. “Those nightmares are very rare now,” she added. “It took me probably a good two years to feel like I was really in a good place.” Saberi chose to share her ordeal with the public. “I tried to focus on writing about my experiences and talking about my cellmates I had left behind,” she said. “It gave me a sense of purpose.” For others, the notoriety is disorienting. Fattal often felt as though people in the United States saw him only as a symbol in the political controversy surrounding Iran, not a human being. “People have such strong opinions about the politics, where as a prisoner, that’s your life,” he said. It was strange to find “everyone arguing about you and what you mean,” he added. “You just want to kind of get your feet on the ground and figure things out again.” That discomfort might be even more pronounced for Rezaian, Abedini and Hekmati, who are returning to the United States during a presidential campaign in which candidates on both sides of the debate about Iran probably will invoke their names and their stories in support of their positions. Fattal predicted that Democratic and Republican candidates alike will point to what Rezaian suffered behind bars to show that Iran can’t be trusted. Rezaian, a journalist, will have a chance to write about his incarceration and set the terms of the debate over the episode himself. “He will have to make a decision about how soon he wants to be public, how much he wants to say that could be private and intimate,” said Ochberg, the psychiatrist. “There are definitely people who are going to be curious.” For now, all that is still in the future, and Rezaian and his fellow former prisoners can enjoy their freedom. “Initially, it’s absolutely fantastic,” said David Rohde, an investigative journalist for Reuters. The Taliban kidnapped Rohde in Afghanistan in 2008 while he was reporting for the New York Times. He escaped after seven months in captivity. “You’re not locked in a room. You eat when you want. You hug your loved ones when you want,” Rohde added. “Whatever difficulties you face, it’s so much better than being there.”","It’s a long trip from Tehran, but it won’t really end when three Americans released from Iranian prisons over the weekend touch down in the United States.

1,"American officials were adamant. The deal they had reached with Iran to free imprisoned Americans, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, had always included his Iranian wife. Rezaian, they knew, would never leave Tehran without her. But as a Swiss plane sat for hours Saturday on the tarmac at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport, waiting to take Rezaian and two of the other released Americans to freedom, neither his wife nor his visiting mother could be found. At the White House, there was growing nervousness that something had gone badly wrong in a prisoner deal that was to coincide with the diplomatic triumph announced earlier in the day — final implementation of the Iran nuclear agreement. In Vienna, Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, there for the nuclear ceremonies, held a tense telephone conversation. In Germany, where the released prisoners were due to arrive at a U.S. air base, Rezaian’s brother, Ali, anxiously worked the phones to Tehran, trying to locate their mother and Jason’s wife. For Rezaian’s family and his employer, who had fought and lobbied for his release, and for the Obama administration officials who ultimately obtained it, the nail-biting denouement was perhaps a fitting closure to the reporter’s 18 months of imprisonment. Even after the plane took off, with all aboard after a delay of more than 12 hours, it was unclear whether the problem had been the result of simple miscommunication on the Iranian side or something more nefarious. ‘Mystified’ and ‘concerned’ On July 22, 2014, Post foreign editor Douglas Jehl received a poorly connected cellphone call from a contact in Tehran. Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, then 38, and his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, had been arrested, the caller said. Jehl immediately reached out to Jason’s brother, Ali, a biotechnology consultant in California, and to Iranian and U.S. officials. “We believed, and very much hoped, this was a misunderstanding . . . nothing more than the kind of unpleasant glitch that sometimes happens in Iran,” Jehl recalled Sunday. Rezaian, a U.S.-born Iranian American, was an “accredited journalist, operating normally, doing nothing wrong,” Jehl said. But hopes that it could be quickly resolved were dashed three days later when a senior judicial official confirmed the arrests. Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, released a statement saying officials at the paper were “mystified” and “profoundly concerned” about Rezaian’s well­-being. The State Department said it was “concerned,” but had no further comment due to “privacy concerns.” At the time, after years of on-and-off negotiations over an Iranian nuclear program that the United States and its allies were convinced had been designed to build a bomb, the West was involved in promising negotiations with Tehran. Rezaian was not the only American known to be held by Iran. At least two others — former Marine Amir Hekmati and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini — had been convicted on charges that the United States said were bogus. U.S. officials said they raised all these cases, along with that of Robert Levinson, a CIA contract worker who had disappeared from Iran’s island of Kish in 2007, on the sidelines of every nuclear and other meeting with Iranian officials. This account of the efforts to secure Rezaian’s release is based on interviews with the Rezaian family, Post executives and senior administration officials, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic matters. Opening back channels As time went on with little news, concern grew that the administration’s eagerness to conclude the nuclear deal had tempered its zeal to press Rezaian’s case with Iran. Although they were in frequent contact with administration officials, the family and The Post had little information about what was going on behind the scenes. “They were certainly focused intently and primarily on the nuclear talks,” Jehl said of the administration. “I think we sometimes felt that Jason’s fate was secondary in their priorities.” Baron, Jehl and other Post editors met with Vice President Biden, Kerry, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Obama national security adviser Susan E. Rice and counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monaco, among others. But “all along, the administration was reluctant to get into a lot of details with us,” Baron said Sunday. Although Post executives dealing with the administration and Iran on Rezaian’s imprisonment erected a wall of silence, excluding Post reporters separately covering it as a news story, administration officials “remained concerned throughout, to the very end, that if they provided us details it would somehow end up being public.” Separately and together, Ali Rezaian and the Post undertook their own efforts, both to open channels to the Iranians, through other governments and private citizens, and to ensure “that the world didn’t lose sight of Jason’s case,” Baron said. Ali Rezaian started an Internet petition that half a million people signed. Foreign governments were asked to bring it up in their meetings with Iran; Post reporters raised the issue in news conferences and interviews. “Free Jason” pins and posters were liberally handed out. The Post hired lawyer Robert M. Kimmitt of WilmerHale, a former senior State Department official who was involved in previous hostage releases. But in Iran, Jason’s health worsened even as his legal situation became even more opaque. In late September 2014, Salehi, Rezaian’s wife, was released on bail. In December 2014, Iran said he would be tried on unspecified charges in a closed hearing; he was denied legal representation and bail. In January 2015, his case was ominously transferred to a branch of the Revolutionary Court, closely aligned with Iran’s intelligence service; shortly thereafter, hard-line judge Abolghassem Salavati was picked to preside over a trial. An indictment indicated that he was being charged with espionage and other counts that each carried a maximum prison term of 10 to 20 years. That May, a closed-door trial was adjourned after one day, only to reconvene in June for three hours, and again in July. No details were released. “It became clear as the process went along,” Ali Rezaian said, “that diplomatic channels weren’t going to be able to solve this problem. . . . Parts of the internal Iranian security apparatus” were going to have to participate “to move things forward.” With Iran’s ‘decision makers’ Shortly after Rezaian’s arrest, Iranian nuclear negotiators mentioned that there were a number of Iranians in U.S. prisons that they would like to see released. But it was not until the fall of 2014 that it became clear that Iran was proposing an exchange. In response, the two sides appointed separate teams, uninvolved in the nuclear talks, to begin discussions in Geneva about prisoners. The teams included officials from agencies across both governments including, most importantly on the Iranian side, the Ministry of Internal Security and other “decision makers” outside the foreign ministry. Several U.S. officials insisted that the two issues were never directly tied — that the United States never indicated that it would alter its position on the nuclear issue in exchange for concessions on prisoners. Kerry, in an interview Sunday morning aboard his returning plane, said he told Zarif: “We believe they are wrongfully held. . . . You believe they violated something in your system. Okay . . . but it could have a profound effect on the way people perceive your country.” But the prisoner talks continued in fits and starts, to some extent, Kerry said, because the Iranians haggled over the number of their citizens to be released by the United States. “For a long period of time, this didn’t move because of the people they were asking for,” he said. Obama insisted that no one charged with terrorism or a violent crime would be released. After a long-term nuclear deal was finally signed last July, U.S. officials said, the tempo of talks on the prisoners increased. In November, when he saw Zarif in Vienna at a meeting on Syria, Kerry said, he thought the prisoner deal was done. “We actually shook hands, thinking we had an agreement,” he said. But it had again hit a snag over U.S. releases, and a deal was blocked by “some folks back in Tehran in a different department,” Kerry said, declining to identify it. The missing wife and mother Early this month, agreement was finally reached on the seven Iranian prisoners to be released. At the same time, it was clear that implementation of the nuclear deal was about to happen. While numerous officials said that they hadn’t planned it that way, they acknowledged that sychronization of the two issues, and the combined diplomatic success they represented, had an undeniable appeal. For Ali Rezaian and lawyer Kimmitt, there were signs that something was afoot. Regular interrogations that Salehi underwent had taken on a different tone. Last week in Washington, Jehl said, “we learned from Washington Post reporting that a deal was very close and that it would be prudent for a reporter to get to Switzerland. And we learned from a contact in Iran that Jason and his family [there] had been told that a release was coming very soon.” But it was not until Saturday morning that they heard directly from the U.S. government that a plan was unfolding. In Vienna, away from the public ceremony announcing implementation of a nuclear deal, Kerry and Zarif signed an agreement on the prisoners. In Washington, Obama had signed the clemency orders for the Iranians. Switzerland, which handled U.S.-Iranian diplomatic matters on the ground in the absence of relations between the two countries, sent a plane to Tehran. “We did exactly as promised,” Kerry said. “We wanted to prove to people [that] when we say something, we do it.” Zarif, he said, had “made it very clear we’d get it done, and done well.” The agreement included a stipulation that any “spouses” were allowed to accompany the prisoners. And then they waited. Unknown to those in Europe and the United States, Rezaian’s wife had been told by Iranian officials that morning that Jason was about to be released and flown out of the country, but that she would not be allowed to go. She and his mother, Mary Rezaian, who was visiting from California, could go to the airport and view his departure from afar. For most of the day, they sat in another part of the airport. They had no contact with the outside world — Salehi’s cellphone had been taken away when she was arrested, and neither felt comfortable using one in Tehran. As night fell, they decided to return to Salehi’s apartment in Tehran. Kerry exchanged numerous calls with Zarif, who said he didn’t know what was going on, but promised to find out and do something about it. In Germany, where his brother was supposed to eventually land, Ali Rezaian was frantically calling friends in Tehran, trying to find the women. Finally, he said Sunday, “I got them on the phone, told them what was going on, and coordinated with State to make sure they could get taken to the airport.” When they arrived, there were additional problems. Mary Rezaian was not on the manifest. It was not until 6:58 a.m. Washington time that Kimmitt got a call on his cellphone from the State Department. The plane, with all aboard, was wheels-up.","American officials were adamant.

Jehl immediately reached out to Jason’s brother, Ali, a biotechnology consultant in California, and to Iranian and U.S. officials. “We believed, and very much hoped, this was a misunderstanding . . . nothing more than the kind of unpleasant glitch that sometimes happens in Iran,” Jehl recalled Sunday. Rezaian, a U.S.-born Iranian American, was an “accredited journalist, operating normally, doing nothing wrong,” Jehl said. But hopes that it could be quickly resolved were dashed three days later when a senior judicial official confirmed the arrests. Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, released a statement saying officials at the paper were “mystified” and “profoundly concerned” about Rezaian’s well­-being. The State Department said it was “concerned,” but had no further comment due to “privacy concerns.” At the time, after years of on-and-off negotiations over an Iranian nuclear program that the United States and its allies were convinced had been designed to build a bomb, the West was involved in promising negotiations with Tehran. Rezaian was not the only American known to be held by Iran. At least two others — former Marine Amir Hekmati and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini — had been convicted on charges that the United States said were bogus. U.S. officials said they raised all these cases, along with that of Robert Levinson, a CIA contract worker who had disappeared from Iran’s island of Kish in 2007, on the sidelines of every nuclear and other meeting with Iranian officials. This account of the efforts to secure Rezaian’s release is based on interviews with the Rezaian family, Post executives and senior administration officials, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic matters. Opening back channels As time went on with little news, concern grew that the administration’s eagerness to conclude the nuclear deal had tempered its zeal to press Rezaian’s case with Iran. Although they were in frequent contact with administration officials, the family and The Post had little information about what was going on behind the scenes. “They were certainly focused intently and primarily on the nuclear talks,” Jehl said of the administration. “I think we sometimes felt that Jason’s fate was secondary in their priorities.” Baron, Jehl and other Post editors met with Vice President Biden, Kerry, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Obama national security adviser Susan E. Rice and counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monaco, among others. But “all along, the administration was reluctant to get into a lot of details with us,” Baron said Sunday. Although Post executives dealing with the administration and Iran on Rezaian’s imprisonment erected a wall of silence, excluding Post reporters separately covering it as a news story, administration officials “remained concerned throughout, to the very end, that if they provided us details it would somehow end up being public.” Separately and together, Ali Rezaian and the Post undertook their own efforts, both to open channels to the Iranians, through other governments and private citizens, and to ensure “that the world didn’t lose sight of Jason’s case,” Baron said. Ali Rezaian started an Internet petition that half a million people signed. Foreign governments were asked to bring it up in their meetings with Iran; Post reporters raised the issue in news conferences and interviews. “Free Jason” pins and posters were liberally handed out. The Post hired lawyer Robert M. Kimmitt of WilmerHale, a former senior State Department official who was involved in previous hostage releases. But in Iran, Jason’s health worsened even as his legal situation became even more opaque. In late September 2014, Salehi, Rezaian’s wife, was released on bail. In December 2014, Iran said he would be tried on unspecified charges in a closed hearing; he was denied legal representation and bail. In January 2015, his case was ominously transferred to a branch of the Revolutionary Court, closely aligned with Iran’s intelligence service; shortly thereafter, hard-line judge Abolghassem Salavati was picked to preside over a trial. An indictment indicated that he was being charged with espionage and other counts that each carried a maximum prison term of 10 to 20 years. That May, a closed-door trial was adjourned after one day, only to reconvene in June for three hours, and again in July. No details were released. “It became clear as the process went along,” Ali Rezaian said, “that diplomatic channels weren’t going to be able to solve this problem. . . . Parts of the internal Iranian security apparatus” were going to have to participate “to move things forward.” With Iran’s ‘decision makers’ Shortly after Rezaian’s arrest, Iranian nuclear negotiators mentioned that there were a number of Iranians in U.S. prisons that they would like to see released. But it was not until the fall of 2014 that it became clear that Iran was proposing an exchange. In response, the two sides appointed separate teams, uninvolved in the nuclear talks, to begin discussions in Geneva about prisoners. The teams included officials from agencies across both governments including, most importantly on the Iranian side, the Ministry of Internal Security and other “decision makers” outside the foreign ministry. Several U.S. officials insisted that the two issues were never directly tied — that the United States never indicated that it would alter its position on the nuclear issue in exchange for concessions on prisoners. Kerry, in an interview Sunday morning aboard his returning plane, said he told Zarif: “We believe they are wrongfully held. . . . You believe they violated something in your system. Okay . . . but it could have a profound effect on the way people perceive your country.” But the prisoner talks continued in fits and starts, to some extent, Kerry said, because the Iranians haggled over the number of their citizens to be released by the United States. “For a long period of time, this didn’t move because of the people they were asking for,” he said. Obama insisted that no one charged with terrorism or a violent crime would be released. After a long-term nuclear deal was finally signed last July, U.S. officials said, the tempo of talks on the prisoners increased. In November, when he saw Zarif in Vienna at a meeting on Syria, Kerry said, he thought the prisoner deal was done. “We actually shook hands, thinking we had an agreement,” he said. But it had again hit a snag over U.S. releases, and a deal was blocked by “some folks back in Tehran in a different department,” Kerry said, declining to identify it. The missing wife and mother Early this month, agreement was finally reached on the seven Iranian prisoners to be released. At the same time, it was clear that implementation of the nuclear deal was about to happen. While numerous officials said that they hadn’t planned it that way, they acknowledged that sychronization of the two issues, and the combined diplomatic success they represented, had an undeniable appeal. For Ali Rezaian and lawyer Kimmitt, there were signs that something was afoot. Regular interrogations that Salehi underwent had taken on a different tone. Last week in Washington, Jehl said, “we learned from Washington Post reporting that a deal was very close and that it would be prudent for a reporter to get to Switzerland. And we learned from a contact in Iran that Jason and his family [there] had been told that a release was coming very soon.” But it was not until Saturday morning that they heard directly from the U.S. government that a plan was unfolding. In Vienna, away from the public ceremony announcing implementation of a nuclear deal, Kerry and Zarif signed an agreement on the prisoners. In Washington, Obama had signed the clemency orders for the Iranians. Switzerland, which handled U.S.-Iranian diplomatic matters on the ground in the absence of relations between the two countries, sent a plane to Tehran. “We did exactly as promised,” Kerry said. “We wanted to prove to people [that] when we say something, we do it.” Zarif, he said, had “made it very clear we’d get it done, and done well.” The agreement included a stipulation that any “spouses” were allowed to accompany the prisoners. And then they waited. Unknown to those in Europe and the United States, Rezaian’s wife had been told by Iranian officials that morning that Jason was about to be released and flown out of the country, but that she would not be allowed to go. She and his mother, Mary Rezaian, who was visiting from California, could go to the airport and view his departure from afar. For most of the day, they sat in another part of the airport. They had no contact with the outside world — Salehi’s cellphone had been taken away when she was arrested, and neither felt comfortable using one in Tehran. As night fell, they decided to return to Salehi’s apartment in Tehran. Kerry exchanged numerous calls with Zarif, who said he didn’t know what was going on, but promised to find out and do something about it. In Germany, where his brother was supposed to eventually land, Ali Rezaian was frantically calling friends in Tehran, trying to find the women. Finally, he said Sunday, “I got them on the phone, told them what was going on, and coordinated with State to make sure they could get taken to the airport.” When they arrived, there were additional problems. Mary Rezaian was not on the manifest. It was not until 6:58 a.m. Washington time that Kimmitt got a call on his cellphone from the State Department. The plane, with all aboard, was wheels-up."
1,"LANDSTUHL, Germany — Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter freed Saturday after almost 18 months of incarceration in an Iranian prison, met with Post editors Monday for the first time since his release and said he was “feeling good” physically as he recovers in a U.S. military hospital here. The Washington Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, and foreign editor, Douglas Jehl, said Rezaian “looked good” during their two-hour meeting in a conference room at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center near Ramstein Air Base. Rezaian, 39, was flown out of Iran on Sunday along with two other freed Iranian Americans as part of a prisoner deal with Iran linked to the implementation of a landmark nuclear agreement. Baron and Jehl said Monday evening that the face-to-face meeting so soon after Rezaian’s release from Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison was an encouraging sign. Doctors and psychiatrists at the hospital are still assessing his health, and the recovery process in similar cases has taken months or years. “I want people to know that physically, I’m feeling good,” said Rezaian, wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt and blue jeans provided to him aboard the Swiss plane that flew the men to freedom. “I know people are eager to hear from me, but I want to process this for some time.’’ Also released in the deal were former Marine Amir Hekmati, 32, of Flint, Mich., and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini, 35, of Boise, Idaho. Accompanying Rezaian on the flight were his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, an Iranian, and his mother, Mary Rezaian. A fourth Iranian American released as part of the arrangement, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, opted to remain in Iran. An American student who was freed separately, Matthew Trevithick, 30, flew out Saturday on his own. Abedini had been imprisoned since July 2012 for organizing home churches. Hekmati spent more than four years behind bars on spying charges following his arrest in August 2011 during a visit to see his grandmother. The historic nuclear accord with Iran dropped economic sanctions against the country and returned tens of billions of dollars in frozen assets in exchange for restrictions and tighter safeguards on Iran’s nuclear program. Members of Hekmati’s family and the congressman from their district, Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.), met with Hekmati at the U.S. military hospital for about 15 minutes Monday, the family announced. On Monday, Rezaian described months of extraordinarily limited human interaction and said that at one point he spent 49 days in solitary confinement. Later, he was put in a 15-by-20-foot room with three cots and no mattresses. For exercise, he said, he would walk for up to five hours every day around an 8-by-8-foot concrete courtyard. Rezaian also talked about some of the conditions of his detention, which Baron and Jehl said they could discuss only partially. For most of his time in prison, Rezaian said, he was being held by Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps, a military force aligned with hard-liners in the government that answers to Iran’s supreme leader and acts independently of the presidency. Even when Rezaian was taken to hospitals — twice for eye infections and once for a groin infection — as his health suffered in prison, they were facilities run by the Revolutionary Guard. There were concerns that Rezaian could be used as a bargaining chip by hard-liners in the Iranian government who wanted to derail talks over the nuclear deal. It was only in the final hours of his incarceration that Rezaian said he was transferred to the Ministry of Intelligence, a body more closely allied with President Hassan Rouhani. Rezaian’s departure from Iran was “touch-and-go until the last minute,” he said. The plane was delayed for hours, and U.S. officials were privately concerned that the prisoner deal had gone bad. Those hours, Rezaian said, were “hugely stressful.” “I was not handed over to the Swiss until I was actually on the plane,” he said. Switzerland represents U.S. interests in Iran in the absence of diplomatic relations between Tehran and Washington. When the plane finally took off, the passengers — including Rezaian, the other released Iranian Americans, and Rezaian’s wife and mother — burst into applause. When they left Iranian airspace, they applauded again. Later on Monday, Rezaian was permitted to leave the hospital for several hours to meet at a nearby guesthouse with his brother, Ali Rezaian, along with his wife, mother and his visiting congressman, Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.). “I want to thank my family, especially the efforts of my brother, Ali, and my wife in Iran and my mother everywhere she was,” Rezaian said. “They have been incredible. I also want to thank everybody at The Post and my colleagues in other media as well, as well as everybody in the U.S. government who played an important role in my release.’’ Once the Americans had left Iran, the Obama administration announced new sanctions related to participation in Iran’s ballistic missile program. The sanctions, which applied to 11 people and companies, were issued under U.S. restrictions that remain in place despite the lifting Saturday of international sanctions linked to Iran’s nuclear program. [For three Americans held in Tehran, reason for travel was deeply personal] The Treasury Department said the new sanctions apply to, among others, the Mabrooka Trading Co., based in the United Arab Emirates, and its networks there and in China. It said they have used front companies to deceive foreign suppliers about the true end-users of “sensitive goods for missile proliferation.” The Iranian government and military said Monday that the new sanctions show continued U.S. hostility toward Iran and vowed defiantly to further develop the missile program. Iran’s defense minister, Revolutionary Guard Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan, accused Washington of demonstrating “hatred toward the Iranian nation” with “useless attempts to weaken Iran’s defense power.” He said Iran’s missile industries “are fully homemade” and impervious to sanctions, the semiofficial Fars News Agency reported. Dehghan said Iran would expand its program by “unveiling new missile achievements soon.” In a statement, Iran’s Foreign Ministry said that “Iran’s missile program has not been designed for carrying nuclear weapons at all, and therefore it doesn’t violate any international rule.” Separately, Rouhani, the president, pledged to the visiting chief of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency that Iran would “never” pursue nuclear weapons, even without the intensified safeguards imposed by the newly implemented nuclear deal. “We will be committed to the fact that our nuclear program is peaceful and will never deviate to weapons,” he told Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in a meeting in Tehran, the Mehr News Agency reported. In Landstuhl, Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.), who arrived Monday as part of a welcoming delegation for Abedini, said he joined in campaigning for Abedini’s freedom after hearing his wife, Naghmeh, speak at a church in Charlotte about the case. Naghmeh is expected to arrive Tuesday, he said. Pittenger said by telephone from the hospital grounds that he had not seen Abedini but that he had been briefed that all the freed hostages were, “generally speaking, in pretty good condition.” “Physically, at least,” he added. Pittenger said doctors would test for communicable diseases to see whether any of the patients needed to be isolated, followed by “longer-term evaluations and analyses with the doctors and psychiatrists.” “Particularly with Saeed, it was 3 
 
 1/ 
 2 
 years in that kind of condition,” he said. “It’s going to have an emotional impact of a serious nature.” There are no estimates on when the men may be discharged from the hospital. “I’m told that when people come here, they spend from five to 10 days,” Pittenger said. “It can be shorter, but having been in isolation and mental torture for 3 
 
 1/ 
 2 
 years, I don’t think they’re going to jump out of here real quick,” he said. In a telephone call with The Post’s editors before they were able to meet Monday, Rezaian said that isolation was the most difficult part of his time in prison. Still, snippets of information had reached him, among them that his Christmas greetings from prison, conveyed via his mother, had “made the rounds and reached everybody, which is what I intended.” He also said that he found escape in the novels he was allowed to read while in prison facing trial on a charge of spying. Rezaian’s health was reported to have suffered because of poor conditions at the prison and a lack of medicine for his high blood pressure. Family members said last year that he had lost weight and suffered from back pain and chronic infections. He told the editors that his health had improved in the past several months. Evin Prison, where Rezaian was held, has been used for decades by Iran’s Islamic revolutionary government and the monarchy it overthrew in 1979 to incarcerate — and, human rights groups say, abuse — political prisoners. Rezaian was tried in secret there last year and was sentenced to an unspecified prison term. Branigin reported from Washington.

1,"A United Nations human rights body, responding to a petition filed last summer by The Washington Post, has concluded that Iran’s detention of Post journalist Jason Rezaian violated several provisions of international law, including by failing to inform him of charges against him and depriving him of his right to counsel and an open, impartial trial. Rezaian was released Saturday after 18 months’ imprisonment as part of a prisoner deal between Iran and the United States. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, part of the U.N. Human Rights Council, said it also would refer allegations of physical ill-treatment of Rezaian, who was held in solitary confinement for part of his detention, to the U.N. special rapporteur on torture. It recognized his right to compensation from the Iranian government. Iran never responded to queries from the group, which is charged with investigating cases of arbitrary detention and allegations of illegal treatment of prisoners. It has no enforcement powers but petitions governments involved for information and recommends courses of action to its parent body. The group’s conclusions, dated Dec. 3, have not been publicly released. They will be included in the group’s annual report to the U.N. Human Rights Council. A copy was obtained by The Post. In a statement released by The Post, Publisher Frederick J. Ryan Jr. said: “We are pleased that the U.N. Working Group has recognized that Iran had no legitimate basis for arresting Jason, let alone imprisoning him for 18 months. Its opinion leaves no doubt that this was an arbitrary and unlawful detention of a journalist. We take comfort in knowing that Jason receives this news as a free man.” The Post’s petition to the United Nations was part of a series of steps the paper took to publicize the Rezaian case and bring international pressure on Iran, even as the Obama administration worked privately to secure the release of Americans it asserts were unjustly imprisoned. As part of the deal implemented Saturday, five Americans were freed, and seven Iranians charged with or convicted here of violating sanctions against Iran were given clemency. Three of the Americans in Iran — Rezaian, Idaho pastor Saeed Abedini and Marine veteran Amir Hekmati — left Iran aboard a Swiss government jet, arriving Sunday at a U.S. military hospital in Germany, where they were reunited with their families. All are dual U.S.-Iranian nationals, as was a fourth freed prisoner who opted to stay in Iran. The fifth prisoner, a U.S. student held since December, left Iran on Saturday on his own.","A United Nations human rights body, responding to a petition filed last summer by The Washington Post, has concluded that Iran’s detention of Post journalist Jason Rezaian violated several provisions of international law, including by failing to inform him of charges against him and depriving him of his right to counsel and an open, impartial trial.

1,"Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian said Wednesday he wants to “catch up” with the world following his release from nearly 18 months in Iranian custody, including watching Golden State Warriors basketball games and the new “Star Wars” movie. Rezaian — who was freed Saturday as part of a wider deal between the United States and Iran — also said he doesn’t plan to make further statements about his ordeal at the moment, but intends to “get back to writing the U.S.-Iran story at some point in the future.” “I’ve spent a lot of my life writing about the United States and Iran, and I never imagined — and never wanted — to become a part of the story, particularly at such an extraordinary moment,” Rezaian said in a statement from Landstuhl, Germany, where he is undergoing medical tests at a U.S. military hospital. Rezaian’s arrest and trial exposed a rift between Iranian hard-liners and reformists that now appears to be widening ahead of elections scheduled for the end of February. The vast majority of reformists who registered as candidates for the 290-seat parliament have been disqualified by the Guardian Council, a vetting body that favors the hard-liners, Iranian news media reported Wednesday. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the leader of the reformist camp, told reporters he was not at all happy with the disqualifications and would “use all my power to protect the rights of candidates.” But Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, backed the exclusions, saying that “only those who believe in the Islamic Republic and its values should be allowed to enter parliament.” Also up for election are members of the 88-seat Assembly of Experts, which would pick the next supreme leader in the event of Khamenei’s death. Both the legislature and the assembly are currently dominated by conservatives. Rezaian, 39, was among a group of four Iranian Americans released as part of a two-country exchange under which the United States also pardoned or dropped ­charges against 21 Iranians in cases related to sanctions on Tehran. In addition, Iran released a fifth American, 30-year-old student Matthew Trevithick, in what U.S. officials described as a separate “humanitarian gesture” that coincided with the lifting of international sanctions on Iran as part of a nuclear pact with world powers. “I want everyone to know that I’m feeling fine, and I feel lucky to be here at a place where I can get such terrific care,” said Rezaian in a written statement before emerging from the hospital to appear before photographers. He was accompanied out of Tehran by his mother and Iranian wife, also a journalist. Rezaian, wearing a black knit cap, smiled and waved as he posed for photographers outside the medical center with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and his mother, Mary Breme Rezaian. Rezaian was detained in July 2014 in Tehran and later faced a closed-door trial on vague charges that included espionage. Rezaian strongly denied the charges, and The Post and other media groups denounced his jailing as wrongful punishment of a journalist who was engaged only in news gathering. He was found guilty last year and sentenced to a prison term, but the secretive Revolutionary Court disclosed neither the specific charges on which he was convicted nor the length of the term. “I hope everyone will respect my need for privacy as I take some time for myself and for my family,” said Rezaian, a native of Northern California. “For now, I want to catch up with what’s been going on in the world, watch a Warriors game or two, and see the Star Wars movie.” On Tuesday, another of the freed Americans, former Marine Amir Hekmati, described the celebrations aboard the special Swiss jet that carried some of the former prisoners from Tehran. “Champagne bottles were popped,” he said. “The Swiss are amazing. The hospitality. Chocolates. Veal was served.” Also released in the deal were Christian pastor Saeed Abedini, 35, of Boise, Idaho, and another Iranian American, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, who opted to remain in Iran. The student, Trevithick, flew out Saturday. Abedini had been imprisoned since July 2012 for organizing home churches. Hekmati was arrested in August 2011 during a visit to see his grandmother.

1,"LANDSTUHL, Germany — It was the call that Yeganeh Salehi had been awaiting for more than a year. At 2 p.m. Saturday, she picked up the phone at her home in Iran and heard the voice of her husband, jailed American reporter Jason Rezaian. “I have been told I am leaving for the airport right now,” he said. Rezaian, the Washington Post correspondent in Tehran, had been detained for 18 months in the city’s notorious Evin prison, held on vague ­espionage-related charges that he denied. His wife, an Iranian, had visited him nearly every week, watching him lose weight and suffer from periodic infections. Now, Rezaian told his wife, they could meet quickly to say goodbye — until they could get her out of Iran, too. “I’d never had such hope,” Salehi, 31, said this week. What she did not know was that the phone call Saturday would be the beginning of a 25-hour ordeal during which Rezaian’s fate would seem to hang in the balance — as would her own. In their first interview since Rezaian left Iran, his wife and his mother, Mary, described the tortuous end to a saga that began with the journalist’s arrest on July 22, 2014, and eventually involved top-level negotiations between Tehran and Washington that produced a deal to free him and three other jailed Iranian Americans. For hours this past weekend, though, it was not clear that the deal would actually work out. As a Swiss air force jet waited on the tarmac at Tehran’s airport to take Rezaian and other former prisoners to freedom, Salehi and her mother-in-law, Mary Rezaian, mysteriously vanished as diplomats, friends and Jason’s brother, Ali, frantically tried to find them. The women later said they had been in the hands of Iran’s hard-line Revolutionary Guard Corps. It was unclear whether the incident was due to miscommunication or whether someone was trying to destroy the deal. Salehi swung between concern and jubilation over her husband’s potential release as she and her husband’s mother were shuttled for hours between ornate reception halls and conference rooms at the airport. “At some point I told her, ‘Mary, somebody wants us out of the picture and there is a reason for it,’ ” Salehi said. “ ‘Something is wrong.’ ” Waiting Shortly after Jason Rezaian called on Saturday afternoon, his wife — who was with Mary Rezaian — received a phone call from a man who did not give his name. He told the women to go to the domestic terminal of the Tehran airport and wait for instructions. They knew the message was from the Iranian security services and hailed a taxi to the airport. Hours passed. Calls began pouring in from friends and relatives as Iranian news outlets announced the release of four Iranian American prisoners but did not give names. On a television set at the airport, Salehi suddenly saw a news ticker confirming the deal. Her husband’s was the first name on the list. Salehi began “jumping, shouting, crying,” she later recalled. The deal freed the four Iranian Americans in exchange for U.S. clemency offered to seven Iranians charged or imprisoned for sanctions violations and the dismissal of charges against 14 Iranians outside the United States. Jason Rezaian, 39, born in Marin County, Calif., to an Iranian father and an American mother, had lived in Iran since 2008 and joined The Post in 2012. He and his wife were arrested together in 2014, but Salehi was freed on bail after three months. Rezaian was convicted following an espionage trial that ended last August, according to Iranian media. Iranian officials never made clear what charges were involved or whether a sentence had been imposed. No evidence of wrongdoing by Rezaian was ever released, The Post said. As Salehi and her mother-in-law waited at the airport Saturday, a man wearing a surgical mask approached about 9 p.m. “Mrs. Salehi, come,” she later recalled him saying. He began leading her out of the terminal, with Mary Rezaian racing after them. Salehi knew immediately the man was from the security services. Apparently he wore the mask to hide his face. Salehi had no idea what to expect. “I just knew that I had to put myself in their hands,” she recalled. The masked man sat them in a silver Peugeot and drove them to the airport’s diplomatic terminal. The women’s phones were taken away, and they were brought into a massive entrance hall. They were told they would see Rezaian. But first Salehi, then Mary Rezaian, were told they would have to speak on camera. State-television journalists began to ask questions. Who was responsible for Jason’s release? Were they happy? “I will be happy when I know my son has left here and has landed safely in another place,” Rezaian’s mother told them. Rezaian was in the next room. When his wife walked in, he stood, wearing his wedding suit, she recalled. Salehi had brought him the outfit a day earlier when prison officials requested clean clothing. It was the smallest suit he had, Salehi said, but he had lost so much weight that it looked several sizes too large. Salehi thought this would be their last meeting for a while — maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe longer. Her husband was a U.S. citizen, but she was not. And who knew when Iranian authorities would permit her to leave? But Rezaian was hesitant to show emotion; there were journalists and guards with video cameras in the room. “I choked up, and he said, ‘Don’t cry,’ ” she said. Salehi’s joy was mixed with anxiety for her husband and frustration that she was about to be separated from him — again. She told Rezaian to call her as soon as he landed and “not to put me in a situation where it’s six or seven hours and I don’t hear from you.” The guards asked whether she was happy her husband would finally be released. “He was getting the chance to leave, and I was still stuck,” she said. “So I was angry, and I told them.” Mary Rezaian, who had moved to Iran seven months ago to be closer to her son, could leave the country any time she wanted on her American passport. But “I promised him I would stay behind until things got resolved with Yegi,” his wife, she said. Kept unawares It was around 10 p.m. Saturday when Salehi and Mary Rezaian were brought into a vast, unheated reception hall with marble floors and portraits of Iranian leaders on the walls. It was “colder than a meat locker,” Mary Rezaian recalled. The women were served kebabs, rice, seared tomatoes and colas and allowed a brief telephone call to Salehi’s parents, only to tell them that she would be home soon. The women were told they could not leave, even as Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CNN that the plane carrying the prisoners would soon depart. Salehi and Mary Rezaian knew their disappearance would alarm friends and relatives, but they could not know how much. Throughout Jason Rezaian’s incarceration, neither of the women had contact with U.S. officials. Ali, Jason’s brother, who was working to win his release, had kept them in the dark about efforts to free Jason, in order to protect them from Iranian officials seeking information. Among the things that Salehi didn’t know: Her freedom was part of the deal. She was supposed to be joining him on the plane. Switzerland, which represents U.S. interests in Iran, played a key role in Rezaian’s release. On Saturday night, the Swiss ambassador went to the airport to meet with Rezaian and two other Iranian Americans, Amir Hekmati and Saeed Abedini, who were supposed to be flown home with him. Rezaian informed the ambassador that his wife and mother were in the airport. But the Iranians told the diplomat that the women had already left. Around 1 a.m., the women were transferred to a warmer room with an antique carpet, accompanied now by a female official in a black chador and about 15 men from the Revolutionary Guard, wearing surgical masks. The guards were polite but ignored their requests to leave, the women said. “I didn’t feel afraid,” Rezaian’s mother said. “I just felt inconvenienced.” At 5 a.m., as Rezaian was being handed over from the Revolutionary Guard to the Intelligence Ministry, a guard told the women that Rezaian’s plane had taken off and that they were free to go. As she was led out of the building, Salehi heard a startling comment from one guard to another. “The plane may take the wife, too,” he whispered. Salehi and her mother-in-law caught a taxi toward the city and clicked on their phones, which were swamped with messages. One of them was from Ali Rezaian. “Where are you?” he wrote. They called him. He told them that the plane had not left, that they were meant to be aboard, too. A Swiss diplomat would get in touch, Ali said. Salehi went to her parents’ home. She already had a bag packed. Salehi exchanged “very short and quick but very emotional” goodbyes with her parents. Unbeknownst to the women, the U.S. government had learned early Sunday that the Iranians wanted to let Rezaian and the other former prisoners leave but delay Salehi’s departure. Only after Secretary of State John F. Kerry called Zarif did the Iranian prosecutor general issue an order allowing Salehi and Mary Rezaian to board the Swiss jet. On Sunday, an SUV with Swiss diplomatic plates raced through the city, carrying the ambassador, Salehi and Mary Rezaian to the airport. Swiss diplomats had orders not to let the women out of their sight. But when the group reached the airport, the two women were detained again. Salehi did not have a passport, and, according to U.S. diplomats, there was a hiccup over the flight manifest. “The Iranians were playing games to the end,” a senior U.S. official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the deal. It was not clear whether some Iranian officials wanted to spoil the deal or were hoping to use the women as a bargaining chip. Hours later, the women were put in a van with the other released prisoners and driven to the plane, where they were turned over to the Swiss. About 3 p.m. Sunday, the flight took off for Geneva as the former captives applauded. Jason Rezaian and his family would later head to Germany, where he would receive medical treatment at a U.S. military base. When they touched down in Switzerland, someone introduced Salehi to Brett McGurk, the lead U.S. negotiator in the prisoner release. “We got you out! One day I’ll tell you the whole story of the past 20 hours,” Salehi recalled him saying. It was at that moment, she said, that she realized “it was a real war to get me out.” Carol Morello in Davos, Switzerland, contributed to this report.

0,"RIYADH – Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Saturday toggled from uncertainty over Syrian peace talks to rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran as he met with Gulf Arabs in the Saudi capital. After meeting with foreign ministers from the six nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council, Kerry said he was confident initial talks between the Syrian government and opposition groups would take place as planned next week in Geneva. The warring participants won’t be at the same table, or even in the same room, but they will be in the same venue while U.N. Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura acts as a go-between. Diplomats have cautioned the Syrian talks might be delayed, due to disagreements over which opposition groups will be invited to attend. If disputes or other problems arise, Kerry told reporters, a 20-member multinational group that has promoted peace talks will convene immediately after the Geneva meetings end. “We want to keep the process moving and put to full test the readiness and willingness of people” to achieve peace, Kerry said, expressing concern that the violence in Syria could spill over its borders. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed in Syria since peaceful protesters were attacked by government forces, resulting in a civil war that has set off a flood of refugees, spawned an Islamic caliphate run by militants and drawn both foreign fighters and military invention by a host of alarmed countries, including Russia, Iran and the United States. Two previous attempts to negotiate an end to the conflict have both failed. Kerry noted there are sharp divisions over the future of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United States insists Assad must eventually leave power and elections called within 18 months of a cease-fire and peace talks starting. “We know that the war in Syria cannot end — it’s not that it will not end, it’s not that people choose otherwise — it’s that it cannot end, because he is the magnet that attracts the violent terrorism and jihadis who will continue to come as long as he or his supporters insist he is a part in a long term future,” Kerry said. Rejecting that notion, Kerry vowed, “We are going to do everything in our power as nations that are deeply impacted by the consequences of Syria to try to push this process forward and help to act as constructive catalysts and try help Syrians to bring about the peace that they desire so much.” Kerry also came to Saudi Arabia to try to diffuse tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and urge Riyadh to restore diplomatic relations with Tehran. After Riyadh executed a Shiite cleric in early January, and protesters stormed Saudi diplomatic compounds in Tehran and another city, Saudi Arabia cut the ties. Both countries, bitter regional rivals, are involved in organizing the Syrian peace talks, and the rising hostilities have raised concerns their spat will spill over and impact the peace talks. Talking to reporters after meeting with Kerry, Saudi Prime Minister Adel al-Jubeir dismissed the idea that the United States and Iran will improve their relations after a landmark nuclear deal was implemented this month. ""No, I don't see a coming together of the United States and Iran,” he said. “Iran remains the world's chief sponsor of terrorism.” Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed regrets over the attack on the Saudi embassy, but Jubeir on Friday called the apology “meaningless” unless it changes its policies and stops supporting terror. Jubeir took another swipe at Iran on Saturday, telling reporters that the recent prisoner release of seven Iranian Americans and Iranian nationals imprisoned in the United States and five Americans imprisoned in Iran was a trenchant example of how Iran’s government is viewed by its own people. “I wouldn’t call it an exchange of prisoners, because every person released in the United States, as I understand, chose to remain in the United States, which tells you what a great country Iran is, that none of them wanted to look forward to going back to it.” Jubeir said he was confident the United States shared Saudi Arabia’s view of Iran. ""Overall I think the United States is very aware of the danger of Iran's mischief and nefarious activities,” he said. “ I don't believe the United States is under any illusion as to what type of government Iran is.” Kerry said the United States has assured the six countries in the GCC that “the United States, as we have said many times, will stand with them against any external threat and defend, if necessary, together with them against those threats.” Read more Death by siege in Syria’s civil war: Hundreds of thousands at risk The costly blunders of Saudi Arabia’s anxiety-ridden monarchy Post owner Jeff Bezos flies reporter Jason Rezaian to U.S. after Iran release","RIYADH – Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Saturday toggled from uncertainty over Syrian peace talks to rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran as he met with Gulf Arabs in the Saudi capital. After meeting with foreign ministers from the six nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council, Kerry said he was confident initial talks between the Syrian government and opposition groups would take place as planned next week in Geneva. The warring participants won’t be at the same table, or even in the same room, but they will be in the same venue while U.N. Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura acts as a go-between. Diplomats have cautioned the Syrian talks might be delayed, due to disagreements over which opposition groups will be invited to attend. If disputes or other problems arise, Kerry told reporters, a 20-member multinational group that has promoted peace talks will convene immediately after the Geneva meetings end. “We want to keep the process moving and put to full test the readiness and willingness of people” to achieve peace, Kerry said, expressing concern that the violence in Syria could spill over its borders. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed in Syria since peaceful protesters were attacked by government forces, resulting in a civil war that has set off a flood of refugees, spawned an Islamic caliphate run by militants and drawn both foreign fighters and military invention by a host of alarmed countries, including Russia, Iran and the United States. Two previous attempts to negotiate an end to the conflict have both failed. Kerry noted there are sharp divisions over the future of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United States insists Assad must eventually leave power and elections called within 18 months of a cease-fire and peace talks starting. “We know that the war in Syria cannot end — it’s not that it will not end, it’s not that people choose otherwise — it’s that it cannot end, because he is the magnet that attracts the violent terrorism and jihadis who will continue to come as long as he or his supporters insist he is a part in a long term future,” Kerry said. Rejecting that notion, Kerry vowed, “We are going to do everything in our power as nations that are deeply impacted by the consequences of Syria to try to push this process forward and help to act as constructive catalysts and try help Syrians to bring about the peace that they desire so much.” Kerry also came to Saudi Arabia to try to diffuse tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and urge Riyadh to restore diplomatic relations with Tehran. After Riyadh executed a Shiite cleric in early January, and protesters stormed Saudi diplomatic compounds in Tehran and another city, Saudi Arabia cut the ties. Both countries, bitter regional rivals, are involved in organizing the Syrian peace talks, and the rising hostilities have raised concerns their spat will spill over and impact the peace talks. Talking to reporters after meeting with Kerry, Saudi Prime Minister Adel al-Jubeir dismissed the idea that the United States and Iran will improve their relations after a landmark nuclear deal was implemented this month. ""No, I don't see a coming together of the United States and Iran,” he said. “Iran remains the world's chief sponsor of terrorism.” Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed regrets over the attack on the Saudi embassy, but Jubeir on Friday called the apology “meaningless” unless it changes its policies and stops supporting terror. Jubeir took another swipe at Iran on Saturday, telling reporters that the recent prisoner release of seven Iranian Americans and Iranian nationals imprisoned in the United States and five Americans imprisoned in Iran was a trenchant example of how Iran’s government is viewed by its own people. “I wouldn’t call it an exchange of prisoners, because every person released in the United States, as I understand, chose to remain in the United States, which tells you what a great country Iran is, that none of them wanted to look forward to going back to it.” Jubeir said he was confident the United States shared Saudi Arabia’s view of Iran.

0,"THE POST has been celebrating the release of reporter Jason Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who is also a journalist, following their unjust detention and Mr. Rezaian’s prolonged imprisonment in Iran. But even after their freeing, Iran remains a world leader in the imprisonment and abuse of journalists. At least 19 other reporters, cartoonists and editors are still being held by the Islamic regime, often in cruel and inhumane conditions, according to  the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). The story of Mr. Rezaian’s ordeal ought to focus more attention on those who remain behind bars. The CPJ’s annual survey of imprisoned journalists describes a wide range of Iranian professionals, from editors of well -known newspapers to “citizen journalists” posting on social media. A number are members of ethnic minorities, including Kurds working for newspapers and websites catering to that population. The majority reported for media associated with reformist political forces in Iran, which have endured repeated waves of repression in recent years. The longest-serving prisoners CPJ identified were arrested in 2007; the most recent were detained this month, in a crackdown ahead of the elections scheduled for late February. Many of the prisoners have, like Mr. Rezaian, suffered from arbitrary and blatantly illegal treatment by Iranian authorities. Some have had their detentions extended or parole denied in violation of Iran’s own laws; a few have had new cases brought against them after their prison terms expired, to keep them jailed. Several have staged hunger strikes in an attempt to gain basic rights, such as medical care or visits with critically ill relatives. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), several of the journalists have serious medical problems that their captors have disregarded. One, Hossein Ronaghi Malki, was reimprisoned last week in violation of medical advice after being paroled to obtain kidney surgery. RSF says his life is now in danger. Another, Said Razavi Faghih, should have been released when he completed a sentence in March, but instead was retried and given a new, longer sentence — not long after undergoing heart surgery. What all of the journalists have in common with Mr. Rezaian is that they are not guilty of any crime recognized by civilized governments. They were targeted explicitly for reporting or commenting on Iran and its leaders. Some are charged with “insulting” Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei or “propaganda against the regime.” Five who were arrested in November were accused of being part of an “infiltration network” backed by “hostile Western countries”; in other words, they interviewed foreign officials or wrote for media outside of Iran. Tehran found an interest in releasing Mr. Rezaian, whose case had received international attention, and who, along with several other Americans, were exchanged for seven Iranians jailed in the United States. But the regime’s fundamental totalitarian character hasn’t altered. We’ll know that Iran has really begun to change when the brave journalists still in prison are freed.

1,"Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and the man who negotiated his release from an Iranian prison, Secretary of State John F. Kerry, lauded the principle of bringing Americans in trouble home, no matter how hard the task, as they shared a stage Thursday at the opening of The Post’s new headquarters. Rezaian, who was released with four other U.S. citizens Jan. 16, and Kerry both choked up with emotion while addressing senior Post executives and invited guests in the main conference room at The Post’s K Street offices in Northwest Washington. Rezaian occasionally stopped to regain his composure as he recalled his 18 months in captivity and trial on espionage and other charges. His family and The Post had called the charges trumped-up accusations leveled against a journalist just doing his job. “For much of the 18 months I was in prison, my Iranian interrogators told me The Washington Post did not exist, that no one knew of my plight, that the U.S. government would not lift a finger for my release,” said Rezaian, who was accompanied by his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, his brother Ali, and the men’s mother, Mary Rezaian. “Today I am in this room with the very people who helped prove the Iranians wrong.” In a long list of thank-yous to his family and Post editors who worked to keep his case in the spotlight, Rezaian thanked Kerry and Brett McGurk, currently a special presidential envoy who negotiated with the Iranians for 14 months for a prisoner deal that got most of the imprisoned Americans out. “No other country would do so much for an ordinary citizen, and I know that,” Rezaian said. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who worked as a senator to get an accounting of prisoners of war and other military personnel lost in Southeast Asia, recalled a desperate search for Rezaian’s mother and wife, who could not be located in Tehran in the final hours before a Swiss plane bearing the group lifted off. U.S. negotiators demanded that the plane not leave without the women, and Kerry enlisted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to help locate a judge in the middle of the night and ensure that the women were at the airport and authorized to depart. “In the military, the most sacred pledge is you can never leave a buddy behind,” said Kerry, pausing momentarily until the emotion in his voice came under control. “Like most pledges, it’s a lot easier to say than to do, no matter how great the effort.” Kerry said the anxiety Rezaian’s family felt for his welfare was shared by the families of the other Americans released as part of the prisoner deal. He vowed to continue working to get information on the whereabouts of Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who has been missing in Iran since 2007. Kerry noted that across the world, 71 members of the news media were killed on the job last year and almost 200 imprisoned. He said journalists once were usually accidental casualties but now are more likely to be deliberately targeted for the stories they have brought to light. “A country without a free and independent press has nothing to brag about, nothing to teach, no way to fulfill its potential,” Kerry said. When Kerry arrived, he sat in the front row between Rezaian and The Post’s owner, Jeffrey P. Bezos. Kerry said journalism is not a dying enterprise, calling curiosity and the desire to know the truth “part of the human DNA.” “The new building is a neon sign that shows faith in the future of newspapers, and that The Washington Post’s storied past in speaking truth to power is one of the reasons that people in the media are prepared to stand up to the powerful,” Kerry said.","Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and the man who negotiated his release from an Iranian prison, Secretary of State John F.

1,"Of the 545 days my colleague Jason Rezaian spent in an Iranian prison, perhaps the most unusual was the time his captors let him watch “The Shawshank Redemption” on Iranian state television. The next day, a hulking man who was guarding Rezaian asked if he’d watched the film, in which the Tim Robbins character wrongfully imprisoned for 19 years escapes by digging a tunnel. Rezaian, The Post’s Tehran bureau chief who was being held on bogus charges, said he had. “Isn’t it kind of weird that I’m able to see that in here?” Rezaian teased. “You know, it might give me some ideas.” The jailor replied: “You can dig all you want. As far as you get in 20 years, you’ll still be inside this prison.” Two weeks ago, Rezaian got out of that hellhole — not by digging but by dogged diplomacy, and a prisoner deal, negotiated by Secretary of State John F. Kerry. Rezaian stopped in Washington this week before returning home to California. He’s not yet doing interviews, but I had the pleasure of sitting down with him Thursday in his suite at the St. Regis — rather better surroundings than his cell in the notorious Evin Prison — to talk about his confinement. A couple of hours earlier, he had taken the stage at the dedication of The Washington Post’s new headquarters, holding back tears as he spoke: “For much of the 18 months I was in prison, my Iranian interrogators told me that The Washington Post did not exist, that no one knew of my plight, and that the United States government would not lift a finger for my release. Today I’m here in this room with the very people who helped prove the Iranians wrong in so many ways.” Among those was the secretary of state, who wept with joy when he met Rezaian for the first time backstage Thursday. Kerry said Rezaian’s release “was really one of the days that I enjoyed the most as secretary of state.” It was, indeed, one of Kerry’s finest hours. Though the White House demonstrated a maddening lack of urgency on Rezaian’s release, Kerry pursued the matter vigorously. In prison, Rezaian saw Iranian reports of the nuclear talks and became hopeful he would be released as part of the deal. When he wasn’t, he hit rock bottom. He got a small boost when his mother, allowed a brief visit, told him how CBS News’s Major Garrett infuriated President Obama by asking why he was “content” to celebrate the nuclear deal without securing the release of Rezaian and others. Rezaian arrived in Washington during a feel-good moment for The Post, when its glitzy new offices were christened. Owner Jeffrey P. Bezos (who gave Rezaian a ride back to the United States on his private jet) and editor Martin Baron (lionized in the movie “Spotlight”) have led The Post past all competitors, including the New York Times, in online readership. “I think The Post is just a little more swashbuckling,” Bezos said at the dedication. “There’s a little more swagger. There’s a tiny bit of badassness here at The Post.” And now, after an 18-month campaign by the paper to keep Rezaian’s case in the public consciousness, his release has been deeply gratifying to his colleagues. Rezaian recounted for me Thursday how he and his wife were taken from their home at gunpoint, blindfolded and handcuffed, and thrown into solitary confinement. He considered himself a prisoner at first, but his captors made clear he was a hostage, a bargaining chip. He lost 45 pounds on prison food, largely a nasty flatbread, then regained some when he bargained for use of a hot plate and cooked what he called “prison chili” with ingredients he was allowed to buy. For a time, guards let him use an exercise bike and weights in their staff room. He never feared for his life, but he wondered if he would languish for years. Since his release, he has reunited with family in Florida. He’s had sushi twice, and there was a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue in his hotel suite. He turned on cable news to catch up on politics — and, aghast, turned it off. He’s heading home to Northern California, where he’ll play Legos with his nephew. He’s free in time to celebrate his 40th birthday and to catch his Oakland A’s in spring training. Rezaian feels well but wonders whether confinement changed his outgoing personality. He doesn’t know what’s next (the man who cut his hair in Florida recognized him from TV news and advised him to find a fat book contract), but he knows he wants to tell the story of his captivity, to “make sure that it wasn’t in vain.” Undoubtedly Rezaian will, again, prevail.

0,"MOSCOW — Four months after launching airstrikes in Syria, the Kremlin is confident that Moscow’s largest overseas campaign since the end of the Soviet Union is paying off. Under the banner of fighting international terrorism, President Vladimir Putin has reversed the fortunes of forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which were rapidly losing ground last year to moderate and Islamist rebel forces in the country’s five-year-old crisis. Government forces are now on the offensive, and last week they scored their most significant victory yet, seizing the strategic town of Sheikh Miskeen from rebels who are backed by a U.S.-led coalition. According to analysts and officials here, the Russian government believes it has won those dividends at a relatively low cost to the country’s budget, with minimal loss of soldiers’ lives and with largely supportive public opinion. “The operation is considered here to be quite successful,” said Evgeny Buzhinsky, a retired lieutenant general and senior vice president of the Russian Center for Policy Studies in Moscow. It could probably continue for one year or longer, he said, “but it will depend on the success on the ground.” Whether the benefits of Russia’s gambit to put soldiers on the ground in Syria will continue over the long term remains to be seen. President Obama warned last year that Russia was entering a “quagmire” reminiscent of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and it is unclear when Moscow could declare victory and whether it has an exit strategy. But as Assad’s forces push forward and as diplomatic talks in Geneva broke off in recriminations Wednesday after just two days, there is little pressure right now on the Kremlin to pull back. “Putin can afford to play geo­political chess in the Middle East because it does not cost much,” said Konstantin von Eggert, an independent political analyst based in Moscow. Entering the conflict in Syria has allowed Putin to combat what he sees as a U.S. policy of regime change, show off his military muscle and reassure allies in the region that Moscow is a loyal partner, von Eggert said. But Russia’s endgame remains unclear, he and others said. “No one asks what Putin is ­doing in Ukraine because it’s obvious,” he said. “In the Middle East, not so much.” There have been some clear costs to Russia’s campaign, including the October bombing of a charter jet filled with Russian vacationers returning from Egypt that left 224 dead. The Sinai Peninsula affiliate of the Islamic State asserted responsibility for the attack. There was also the downing of a Russian strike fighter by Turkish F-16s in November that resulted in the death of one pilot. A Russian marine was subsequently killed during a rescue attempt, probably by U.S.-backed rebels. And on Wednesday, Russia’s Defense Ministry announced that a military adviser was killed by mortar fire earlier in the week. It blamed the Islamic State. Yet those incidents have not prompted the kind of round-the-clock television coverage drawn by the conflict in Ukraine, in which Russia has denied having a formal role. “This is a limited war that doesn’t really have an effect in Russia,” said Maxim Shevchenko, a Russian journalist who has supported the Russian intervention in Syria and traveled after New Year’s Day to the country, where he embedded with Hezbollah fighters. “There is no stream of coffins,” he said. “There is nothing comparable even to Donetsk,” he added, referring to Russian deaths in eastern Ukraine, including some believed to be active servicemen. Russian officials, including Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, also have batted away accusations that Russian bombers have focused their firepower on more moderate opponents of the Assad regime instead of the Islamic State. The Russian intervention has upended the Obama administration’s version of a negotiated settlement to the war, including an abdication by Assad. The opposition was hesitant to join talks this week in Geneva because of perceived backtracking from the United States on Assad’s future. In many ways, Putin’s intervention may be more important as a diplomatic tool than on the battlefield. Analysts in Moscow said Assad has retaken only about 2 percent of the country’s territory in the four months since the Russian intervention. “The Russian intervention already accomplished the biggest thing it could, which was ensuring the cohesion and stability of the Syrian regime,” said Steven Simon, a lecturer at Dartmouth College , who was the senior director for the Middle East and North Africa at the National Security Council from 2011 to 2012. Although questions remain about the potential of the Syrian army and its ability to take back land, the intervention has had an outsize influence on negotiations. “The Washington officials who work on this issue are scarcely oblivious to the impact of Russia’s intervention on the course of the war,” he said. “I think they understand at this point that the options and the ambitions of the opposition . . . are necessarily truncated.” Alexander Aksenyonok, a veteran Soviet diplomat and former charge d’affaires at the Soviet Embassy in Syria, said that he thought Russia’s focus would shift toward diplomacy in the coming months. But the military operation has played an important role, and will continue to do so, he said. “I think that if this military pressure had not been applied, we would not be seeing the diplomatic activity we are seeing now,” he said. “When I say that Russia has gained more than it has lost, I have this in mind, too.” Correction:  An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Steven Simon as a senior  fellow at the Middle East Institute.

Under the banner of fighting international terrorism, President Vladimir Putin has reversed the fortunes of forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which were rapidly losing ground last year to moderate and Islamist rebel forces in the country’s five-year-old crisis. Government forces are now on the offensive, and last week they scored their most significant victory yet, seizing the strategic town of Sheikh Miskeen from rebels who are backed by a U.S.-led coalition. According to analysts and officials here, the Russian government believes it has won those dividends at a relatively low cost to the country’s budget, with minimal loss of soldiers’ lives and with largely supportive public opinion. “The operation is considered here to be quite successful,” said Evgeny Buzhinsky, a retired lieutenant general and senior vice president of the Russian Center for Policy Studies in Moscow. It could probably continue for one year or longer, he said, “but it will depend on the success on the ground.” Whether the benefits of Russia’s gambit to put soldiers on the ground in Syria will continue over the long term remains to be seen.

0,"PRESIDENT OBAMA vowed as he took office seven years ago to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison, whose use for the holding of terrorism suspects arrested abroad long ago proved counterproductive. Thanks to congressional opposition, he has not fulfilled the pledge. On Tuesday, the president offered one more plan for doing so, only to be swiftly rebuffed by Republicans. Though the proposal was flawed, he deserves more of a hearing. As Mr. Obama rightly argued, this festering legacy of the George W. Bush administration’s response to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, should not be passed on to the next president. This administration bears some responsibility for Guantanamo’s continuing role as a warehouse for prisoners who were captured in the early 2000s, mostly in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and held ever since. Since 2009, the Pentagon has moved only in fits and starts to review the cases of those held and to arrange the transfer of those freed for release. Mr. Obama has nevertheless managed to reduce the population from 238 to 91, of whom 10 are on trial in military commissions and 35 have been cleared for release to other countries. The Pentagon plan submitted to Congress calls for the transfer of those who cannot be safely released to other countries — about 60 prisoners — to a location, most likely a federal prison, in the United States. The military commission trials, including of several of the prime authors of the 9/11 attacks, would continue. But as Mr. Obama pointed out, the proceedings have resulted in “years of litigation without a resolution.” He said the administration would soon propose reforms to the commissions requiring congressional action. Part of the resistance to closing Guantanamo comes from Republicans who insist that it would be too dangerous to hold al-Qaeda militants anywhere in the United States. This is unserious: Federal supermax prisons already securely house a number of dangerous terrorists, both foreign and domestic. The Obama administration has made a practice of transferring al-Qaeda suspects to the federal court system for prosecution, with good results. A legal study attached to the Pentagon report largely dismisses concerns that militants could eventually be released inside the United States. A more serious objection comes from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the Armed Services Committee chairman, who has favored closing Guantanamo. He says the Pentagon plan punts on crucial specifics about how present and future terrorist detainees would be held. Though it studied more than a dozen potential domestic facilities, the administration did not settle on a recommended site; nor did its report — which was mandated by Congress — specify what would be required to modify a domestic prison to hold war prisoners. What would happen to the major al-Qaeda figures now on trial was not spelled out. And the plan does not provide for terrorist operatives who might be captured in the future and held under the laws of war. Mr. McCain said his committee will “closely scrutinize and hold hearings” on Mr. Obama’s proposal. That provides an opening for the administration to work with those in Congress who favor closing Guantanamo to develop a more detailed plan. It’s not enough for the president to give speeches about shutting down the prison; he must offer specifics, and follow through on Capitol Hill. Read more about this topic: Gregory B.

0,"An elderly U.S. citizen whose son was arrested in Iran last fall has also been detained in Tehran, his family said Wednesday. Baquer Namazi, 80, was arrested Monday evening and apparently taken to Tehran’s Evin prison, according to a Facebook posting by his wife, Effie. Their son, Siamak, an Iranian American businessman based in Dubai, has been held by Iranian security authorities since October. It is not clear what crime he is accused of committing, and no charges in his case have been announced. In an open Facebook message to friends and relatives, Effie Namazi wrote that neither she nor a family lawyer has been able to get more information about the circumstances behind her husband’s arrest. “Now both my innocent son Siamak and my Baquer are in prison for no reason,” she wrote. “This is a nightmare I can’t describe.” Bijan Khajehpour, who is married to Baquer Namazi’s niece, said the family would make no further statement. The Iranian lawyer, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabei, told the Associated Press on Thursday that he does not believe the elder Namazi will face “political charges,” and is being held “for some investigation only.” “It is unlikely that he will be charged,” the lawyer told AP. Baquer Namazi has a heart ailment and other conditions requiring medication, his wife wrote. She described herself as “extremely concerned and worried sick” about his health. Her husband was a prominent official during the rule of the shah, who was toppled in the Islamic revolution of 1979. Namazi, a former governor of the oil-rich province of Khuzestan, was allowed to leave Iran with his family in 1983 and immigrate to the United States. He subsequently moved permanently back to Iran. Most recently, Namazi was the head of Hamyaran, a group of Iranian nongovernmental organizations. His son worked for Crescent Petroleum in the United Arab Emirates. Mark Toner, the State Department’s deputy spokesman, said he was aware of reports that another U.S. citizen had been detained in Iran but cited privacy considerations in declining to say more. “The U.S. Department of State has no higher priority than the protection of U.S. citizens overseas,” he said. “We take our obligation to assist U.S. citizens abroad seriously.” The arrest of the family patriarch comes days before Iranians go to the polls to elect a national parliament and the Assembly of Experts, a group of mostly elderly clerics tasked with picking a new supreme leader when the ailing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dies. Last month, Iran released five U.S. citizens, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. Most were part of a prisoner deal arranged over months of negotiations, but Siamak Namazi was not in the group. “I pray to God that my Siamak and Baquer return home to me and that they are released,” Effie Namazi wrote. “Please keep them in your prayers.”","An elderly U.S. citizen whose son was arrested in Iran last fall has also been detained in Tehran, his family said Wednesday.

0,"IF YOU are a Washington foreign policy analyst who supported the nuclear deal with Iran, then the result of the country’s elections last week was a resounding victory for reformists that proves the wisdom of President Obama’s engagement with the Islamic republic. If you opposed the deal, then the election merely entrenched conservatives and hard-liners. Such is the opacity of Iranian politics that neither of those dueling narratives could be entirely discounted following the release of the election results this week. What seems relatively clear is that the voting for parliament, and for the Assembly of Experts that will choose the next Iranian supreme leader, showed, like most Iranian elections, that a large part of the public supports a liberalization of the regime. But as in the past, that popular sentiment is unlikely to bring about substantial change in the near future — in part because many of those elected are far less reform-minded than those who voted for them. The basis for optimism lies in the relative success of a “list of hope” linked to President Hassan Rouhani, who led the regime to the nuclear deal. Those moderate candidates captured at least 85 seats in the 290-member Majlis, according to tallies by the Associated Press and Reuters, and all 30 of those contested in Tehran. More conservatives won election overall, but hard-liners linked to the faction of Holocaust-denying former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad lost seats. Meanwhile, a Rouhani coalition attracted considerable support in the vote for the Assembly of Experts, including 15 of Tehran’s 16 places. That body will make the critical choice of a successor to hard-line Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate power in the Iranian system. Claims of a reformist triumph, however, are overblown. Before the elections, an Iranian liberal coalition said that 99 percent of 3,000 pro-reform candidates had been disqualified by a hard-line clerical council. Most of those in Mr. Rouhani’s coalition are, like him, moderate conservatives, meaning they favor economic reforms and greater Western investment, but not liberalization of the political system or a moderation of Iran’s aspiration to become the hegemon of the Middle East. True Iranian religious and political reformers, like those who joined the 2009 Green Movement, are in jail or exile, or were banned from the ballot. At best, the elections will allow Mr. Rouhani to press ahead with his economic agenda: He is intent on improving the economy before the next presidential election, in 2017. More foreign investment and higher living standards for Iranians could, over time, increase pressure for moderation of the regime’s domestic and foreign policies; that, anyway, is the theory embraced by Mr. Obama. For now, Iran can be expected to continue the course it has been pursuing in the months since the nuclear deal was struck: waging proxy wars against the United States and its allies around the Middle East, using its unfrozen reserves to buy weapons, and defying non-nuclear limits — such as by testing long-range missiles. The elections won’t make the regime more pliable, and they won’t change the need for a U.S. counter to its aggressions. They shouldn’t provide an excuse for the Obama administration to tolerate Tehran’s provocations.

0,"Nine years after former FBI agent Robert Levinson went missing on the Iranian island of Kish, U.S. officials say there is disagreement over his whereabouts. Former and current FBI agents say they think that Levinson, if he is alive, remains in Iran. But others in the U.S. government think he may be elsewhere, after the family was sent a hostage video in late 2010 that officials say came from Pakistan. The family also received from Afghanistan pictures of Levinson in an orange jumpsuit, officials say. The debate over Levinson’s location comes nearly two months after an agreement with Iran led to the release of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and four other Americans. Levinson’s family hoped that he would be among those freed, but after the deal was announced, the White House said that Levinson may not be in Iran after all. Iranian officials have insisted that the government does not know what happened to Levinson, who was also working as a CIA contractor at the time of his disappearance. On Wednesday, Secretary of State John F. Kerry marked the ninth anniversary of Levinson’s disappearance with a statement that vowed “to locate Bob and bring him home.” “As the president has said, and as I have told the Levinson family when I have met with them, we will never forget Bob, and we will not rest until the Levinson family is whole again,” said Kerry, who repeatedly raised Levinson’s disappearance during negotiations with Iran. Kerry noted that the FBI has a $5 million reward for information leading to the safe return of Levinson, who turns 68 on Thursday. “The U.S. government in its entirety will continue all efforts to locate Bob and bring him home,” he said in a statement. “The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has committed to cooperating with the United States to determine the whereabouts of Mr. Levinson, and we are holding Iran to its promise.” Levinson’s wife, Christine, implored Washington and Tehran to dig into her husband’s disappearance and to keep pushing for his freedom. “These past 9 years — 3,288 days — have been harder for our family than anyone could ever imagine,” she said. “But, as difficult as it has been for us, we know that Bob is living a nightmare that is 100 times worse. We need the United States government and the country of Iran to work together to resolve what happened to Bob and return him safely to his family.” In a statement,  FBI Director James B. Comey said, “We are encouraged by recent cooperation between the government of Iran and the United States and believe that our ability to locate Bob and reunite him with his family requires a shared commitment by the Iranian government.” On Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the United States “is going to great lengths to find this citizen so we can bring him home.” “We will spare no effort to secure his return,” he said. “We do not know where he is and that makes it hard to determine what his status is.” Steven Mufson contributed to this report.","Nine years after former FBI agent Robert Levinson went missing on the Iranian island of Kish, U.S. officials say there is disagreement over his whereabouts.

But he’s been meeting foreign leaders: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan.” Trump would succeed in closing the federal prison in Guantanamo, Cuba, the president said, “because he knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.” Noting that former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg was at the dinner, Obama compared him to Trump, another New York billionaire. Bloomberg “knows policy in depth and he’s actually worth the amount of money he says he is,” said Obama, drawing ooohs from the crowd. Turning on himself, Obama said: “I do apologize that I was a little late tonight. I was running on CPT [colored people’s time] — which stands for jokes that white people should not make. “This is my eighth and final appearance and I am excited. If this material works well, I’m going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year [and] earn me some serious Tubmans.” He added, “Next year someone else will be standing in this spot. And its anyone’s guess who she will be.” He noted that on his recent trip to Great Britain, he had lunch with the queen, saw a Shakespeare performance and played golf with Prime Minister David Cameron. “Just in case anyone was wondering if I’m black enough, I think that settles the debate.” Commenting on his family’s desire to finally leave the White House after two terms, Obama quipped: “Someone jumped the White House fence last week. But I have to give the Secret Service credit. They found Michelle and brought her back. “And yet,” he added, “somehow despite all the churn, my approval ratings keep going up. The last time I was this high I was trying to decide on my major.” Turning to the contest among those vying to replace him, the president introduced Bernie Sanders. “Bernie, you look like a million bucks! Or to put it in terms you’ll understand: 37,000 donations of $27 each.” He cracked that Sanders’s campaign slogan — “Feel the Bern” — was superior to Hillary Clinton’s: “Trudge up the Hill.” As for Trump’s Republican challengers, Obama noted: “Ted [Cruz] had a tough week. He went to Indiana . . . and called a basketball hoop a basketball ring. What else is in his lexicon? ‘Baseball sticks? Football hats? But sure, I’m the foreign one.” During his two terms in office, Obama has been among the more adept at delivering his comedy monologue, an annual ritual since John F. Kennedy began the tradition at the dinner in 1962. The event once again was a mashup of Hollywood’s beautiful people, famous-for-Washington types, business executives, sports stars, military representatives and many well-connected nobodies. There were even a few actual White House correspondents. The unusual diversity of the crowd led to some one-of-a-kind encounters. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, Michelle Dockery of “Downton Abbey,” “Spotlight” actress Rachel McAdams and MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell all gathered at one pre-dinner reception. Vice President Biden sat during the dinner with Kerry and actress Helen Mirren (the vice president typically doesn’t attend the dinner; it was Biden’s first). At one point Biden greeted singer Gladys Knight by saying, “I am the Pip!” During a pre-party hosted by ABC and Yahoo, former secretary of state Madeleine Albright was mobbed by fans seeking photos while actress Anna Kendrick (“Pitch Perfect”) was unnoticed off to the side. Sanders eschewed the standard tuxedo in favor of a suit and tie. He and his wife, Jane, were guests of CBS. Actress Carrie Fisher brought her own guest, her French bulldog Gary, who was clad in a studded collar. Trump declined to attend this year’s event, despite numerous invitations from media organizations. His eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., attended in his place. The night’s Hollywood contingent included Will Smith, Bryan Cranston, Morgan Freeman, “Harry Potter” star Emma Watson, “Homeland” and “Billions” star Damian Lewis, “Scandal” star Kerry Washington and reality TV personality Kendall Jenner. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo was among the professional athletes in attendance. The sponsoring White House Correspondents’ Association saluted Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who was jailed by Iranian authorities for 18 months until his release in January. Rezaian, who attended the dinner with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and brother Ali, received a standing ovation when he presented a series of journalism awards. “This is a big and intimidating room,” he told the crowd, “but it beats solitary confinement.” The event was carried live by C-SPAN, CNN, MSNBC and Fox News. The first dinner was held in 1921, when a group of reporters who had covered Warren G. Harding’s presidential campaign got together to fete the newly elected president. He didn’t show up. Staff writers Helena Andrews, Jessica Contrera, Emily Heil, Maura Judkis, Roxanne Roberts, Manuel Roig-Franzia, Ben Terris and Dan Zak contributed to this report.","In his final performance as stand-up comedy’s commander in chief, President Obama shticked the landing at Saturday’s annual White House correspondents’ dinner, cracking wise about the election, his waning days as president and, of course, Donald Trump. “The Republican establishment is incredulous [Trump] is the nominee,” joked the president during his monologue before 2,600 dinner-goers at the Washington Hilton. “Incredulous.

0,"Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Tuesday used the example of a Washington Post reporter imprisoned for over a year in Iran as a case that Kerry said underscores the need for a free and independent press. In remarks to reporters on World Press Freedom Day, Kerry said he had welcomed home Jason Rezaian when he was released after 545 days in captivity in a notorious Iranian prison often used to interrogate and hold political prisoners. Rezaian, The Post’s correspondent in Tehran, was tried and convicted in Iran of espionage and other related charges. In January, he was freed along with three other U.S. citizens in an agreement that involved the release of Iranian citizens jailed in the United States. “Jason did not go to Iran to advance an ideology or to make a political point,” Kerry said. “He actually went there to explain to his own country what life was really like in the country of his ancestry. And he wanted to replace misconceptions with accurate perceptions. That is all. But that is everything.” For the past week, the State Department has been highlighting journalists in countries around the world who have been arrested by governments that didn’t like the facts they were digging up. World Press Freedom Day, established by the United Nations in 1993, aims to draw attention to their plight. “Governments who crack down on that may seek to convey strength, but what they actually convey is a deeply rooted kind of insecurity and weakness,” Kerry said. “No government, whatever its pretensions or whatever its accomplishments, can fairly claim respect if its citizens are not allowed to say what they believe, or denied the right to learn about events and decisions that affect their lives,” he added. “A country without a free and independent press has nothing to brag about, nothing to teach, no way to fulfill its potential. To those who try to coerce and imprison reporters we will always say that committing journalism — reporting of the truth — is not a crime. It is a badge of honor.” Kerry said that in wars and international crises, governments may try to change the narrative by attacking the reporting. “If you look behind the conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Ukraine, or the tensions on the Korean Peninsula or the South China Sea, or the terrorist propaganda that degrades our social media, or the campaigns by civil society to confront high-level corruption in some places, you will see in all of those places and all of those efforts a fundamental battle to define reality.” The U.S. Agency for International Development has provided physical and digital training to about 750 journalists worldwide, and it is increasing its funding of those programs to $2.5 million, Kerry said.","Secretary of State John F.

1,"While pocketing $1.3 billion in annual U.S. military aid, the Egyptian government of Abdel Fatah al-Sissi is waging war against what it describes as an American-inspired plot to divide and destroy the country. The Obama administration’s response to this vicious campaign, which has included prosecuting U.S.-backed nongovernmental organization in Cairo and seeding the state media with poisonous anti-American propaganda, is to pretend that it isn’t happening. Case in point: the American citizen Aya Hijazi of Alexandria, Va. Hijazi (sometimes spelled Hegazi), 29, has been imprisoned in Cairo without trial since May 2, 2014 — 801 days as of Monday. She was arrested with her husband and four other people for operating a nonprofit NGO, the Belady Foundation, which was dedicated to rescuing abandoned and homeless kids. Hijazi and her husband have been charged with sexually abusing the children and paying them to participate in anti-government demonstrations — allegations that Egyptian and international human rights groups have described as preposterous. The real offense of this George Mason University graduate is to be an American who founded an Egyptian NGO — something that, in the eyes of the Egyptian security services, must make her part of the nefarious anti-Egyptian plot that Sissi and the regime’s ideologues imagine. She is, in essence, a prisoner in what Sissi has called the “fourth generation war” against what he thinks is U.S.-backed subversion. And the Obama administration’s response to this gross persecution of an American? Absolute silence. When Hijazi was smeared as a sex criminal and a U.S. secret agent on Egyptian state television; when her pretrial detention passed Egypt’s legal limit of two years; when her case was postponed seven times on ridiculous pretexts — the State Department did not offer a single word of defense or public protest. A U.S. consular official appeared at Hijazi’s last court hearing, on May 21. According to the family, the official was denied entrance to the courtroom — and the proceeding resulted in another long postponement, until Nov. 19. State had nothing to say about that, either. Egyptian and international human rights groups have not been so tongue-tied. In May, a statement by 17 Egyptian human rights groups pointed out that the allegations of sexual abuse had been disproved by the government’s own forensic examinations — which probably explains why the trial has been repeatedly postponed. Instead, the statement said, Hijazi’s prolonged pretrial detention serves as “a form of punishment in and of itself, a means to retaliate against activists unrelated to any legal grounds for detention.” On May 19, the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights filed a petition on Hijazi’s case to the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. It said Hijazi had been subjected to “coercive interrogation techniques.” One security officer “hit her neck, bringing her to her knees, called her names, threatened to urinate into her vagina, and said that she should be sentenced to death or at minimum, life imprisonment.” The Obama administration remained silent. Hijazi’s case resembles that of Jason Rezaian, the Post reporter who was arrested by Iranian authorities in the summer of 2014 and held until early this year. Rezaian, too, was subjected to a prolonged pretrial detention in violation of Iran’s laws, smeared as a U.S. spy in local media and abused by interrogators who attempted in vain to concoct a case against him. Yet President Obama himself publicly spoke up for Rezaian, calling his imprisonment unjust and demanding his release. So what explains the failure to defend this equally innocent, if less prominent, U.S. citizen? The obvious answer is that the Obama administration is loath to acknowledge that the U.S. relationship with longtime ally Egypt has turned toxic — that Sissi treats Americans in Egypt as enemies even while pocketing bounteous U.S. aid. When I asked about the case last week, a State Department official who declined to be identified offered a technical excuse: State had not received written permission from Hijazi to speak out. That is disputed by Hijazi’s family, which says she signed a waiver; Rezaian also told me he never provided such written consent. The State Department official provided me with this unattributable statement: “We are aware that Ms. Hijazi has been detained in Egypt for more than two years and is currently on trial. We have made clear to the Egyptian authorities our interest in a speedy conclusion to her case. Two years is too long to wait for justice.” Hijazi is only one of thousands of peaceful activists who have been jailed by the Sissi regime. She is, however, an American, a citizen of a country that is heavily funding the very military establishment that is persecuting her. That the Obama administration is prepared to tolerate her unjust imprisonment so meekly is not only shameful; it’s an invitation to more attacks on innocent Americans.

1,"Critics of the Obama administration’s dealings with Iran on Friday accused the White House and the State Department of lying about a $400 million cash payment to Iran in January in what officials now acknowledge was conditioned on freedom for American prisoners. Republicans were among those who disparaged State Department spokesman John Kirby’s explanation Thursday that the money, part of a settlement for a claim Tehran had on its own assets frozen by Washington decades ago, was “leverage” to ensure a plane carrying three released American prisoners could leave the country. On several occasions in the past seven months, administration officials, including President Obama himself, insisted the two situations were separate and unrelated. Kirby on Friday acknowledged there was at least some link. “The only connection was at the endgame,” he said. “Iran was not behaving well. So a decision was made on the spot, given Iran’s behavior, that we should hold up on the $400 million.” Many who have called the payment a ransom were not assuaged. “The president and the State Department deceived us all, Congress and, more importantly, the American people,” said Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee. “What the State Department said is their effort to begin to address that.” The controversy involves a negotiated settlement between Tehran and Washington over $400 million that Tehran placed in a trust fund in the 1970s to buy military equipment. When the Shah was overthrown in 1979 and hostages taken at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, the United States froze the assets. According to a senior administration official familiar with the talks, a special claims tribunal in The Hague was preparing to rule on Iran’s claim. At the same time, the official said, negotiations were being finalized to implement the Iran nuclear deal and the release of Americans who Washington considered unjustly detained, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. The $1.7 billion settlement, including interest, was announced on Jan. 17, the same day the nuclear deal took effect and the five American prisoners were set free. What was not announced, however, is that the initial $400 million payment had already been made. Statements by Obama and Secretary of State John F. Kerry that day both said Iran “will receive” the money, a choice of tense suggesting it was in the future. Another senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under the State Department’s rules, said decisions were being made on the fly, and in high drama, as negotiators feared the Iranians would renege on their promises and never let the Americans leave Iran. The Iranian negotiators were unhappy that one of seven Iranians being freed from U.S. jails under a deal that released prisoners was refusing to accept a pardon if it meant he had to return to Iran. “The Iranians thought we were playing a fast one with them; why would their guy not accept a pardon?” said the official, describing a pressure-cooker environment. The American prisoners were being held incommunicado at the airport, prevented from boarding the Swiss Air plane ready to fly them home. Rezaian’s wife and mother could not be located, and the Iranians had no idea where they were. “Our contacts in Iran were acting in a manner that suggested the Americans might never leave Iran,” the official said. “We thought they might be returned to Evin Prison. It would have been irresponsible to move ahead with the subsequent payment. What we had hoped would be a very smooth, culmination day ended up being hardly that.” For months, the State Department brushed off suspicions on Capitol Hill that the settlement was a ransom. But their concerns were bolstered after an Aug. 3 story in the Wall Street Journal revealed that $400 million, in foreign currency piled on pallets, had been given to Iran as the prisoners were released. State Department officials tried to quash the controversy. “Reports of link between prisoner release & payment to Iran are completely false,” Kirby tweeted that day. “The idea that this was all orchestrated as part of some kind of quid pro quo is just not accurate,” said deputy spokesman Mark Toner the next day. “What I do, though, want to disassociate [is] the idea .... that there was some sort of tie between the two,” said spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau on Aug. 8. On Wednesday, the Journal reported the United States delayed delivering the $400 million until it knew the U.S. prisoners — Rezaian, Marine Amir Hekmati and Pastor Saeed Abedini — were in the air. The next day Kirby called it leverage. State Department officials still have refused to provide a detailed account of either the cash payment or the plane liftoff. They have said the $1.3 billion in interest has been fully paid, but have provided no details on when or how. Critics say the lack of specifics, and the earlier statements denying any connection, back their belief the administration was covering up a ransom. “The president and his administration have been misleading us since January about whether he ransomed the freedom of the Americans unjustly imprisoned in Iran,” said House Speaker Ryan in a statement Friday. Mark Dubowitz, the head of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies who has testified frequently before Congress criticizing the Iran nuclear deal, said the Americans using the $400 million to get their prisoners back was as much leverage as the Iranians using prisoners to get their money back. “This is clearly a weak cover story to hide a ransom payment by an administration that concocted a quid pro quo scheme too cute by a half,” he said. Kirby said Friday that the decisions made by stressed-out negotiators were proper, and critics were co-mingling separate agreements. “The quid pro quo for the $400 million was they got their money, and we got a favorable negotiated interest rate,” he said. “The quid pro quo for the prisoners was we got our guys back, and they got theirs back. “But there was no linkage between the $400 million and the prisoners, except in time and space at the end game.”  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified senior administration officials as being in the State Department.","Critics of the Obama administration’s dealings with Iran on Friday accused the White House and the State Department of lying about a $400 million cash payment to Iran in January in what officials now acknowledge was conditioned on freedom for American prisoners.

State Department officials tried to quash the controversy. “Reports of link between prisoner release & payment to Iran are completely false,” Kirby tweeted that day. “The idea that this was all orchestrated as part of some kind of quid pro quo is just not accurate,” said deputy spokesman Mark Toner the next day. “What I do, though, want to disassociate [is] the idea .... that there was some sort of tie between the two,” said spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau on Aug. 8. On Wednesday, the Journal reported the United States delayed delivering the $400 million until it knew the U.S. prisoners — Rezaian, Marine Amir Hekmati and Pastor Saeed Abedini — were in the air. The next day Kirby called it leverage. State Department officials still have refused to provide a detailed account of either the cash payment or the plane liftoff. They have said the $1.3 billion in interest has been fully paid, but have provided no details on when or how. Critics say the lack of specifics, and the earlier statements denying any connection, back their belief the administration was covering up a ransom. “The president and his administration have been misleading us since January about whether he ransomed the freedom of the Americans unjustly imprisoned in Iran,” said House Speaker Ryan in a statement Friday. Mark Dubowitz, the head of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies who has testified frequently before Congress criticizing the Iran nuclear deal, said the Americans using the $400 million to get their prisoners back was as much leverage as the Iranians using prisoners to get their money back. “This is clearly a weak cover story to hide a ransom payment by an administration that concocted a quid pro quo scheme too cute by a half,” he said. Kirby said Friday that the decisions made by stressed-out negotiators were proper, and critics were co-mingling separate agreements. “The quid pro quo for the $400 million was they got their money, and we got a favorable negotiated interest rate,” he said. “The quid pro quo for the prisoners was we got our guys back, and they got theirs back. “But there was no linkage between the $400 million and the prisoners, except in time and space at the end game.”  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified senior administration officials as being in the State Department."
0,"When Barack Obama was on his rise to the White House, it was often said that he was one of the luckiest politicians in the country. The same could now be said about Hillary Clinton. This was a week in which any number of developments could have put Clinton on the defensive. Instead, days of turmoil inside Donald Trump’s campaign made the Republican nominee the big story — and the coverage of his campaign was anything but flattering. Trump’s advisers think that on balance the week was positive, the best of the month. They now hope they can begin to shift the focus to Clinton and, if they’re successful, the polls that show her leading will narrow. That assumes two things: that Trump won’t create more controversy in the days and weeks ahead; and that voters will ultimately see her vulnerabilities as more disqualifying than the many liabilities that Trump has revealed during the campaign. Clinton’s assets are well-known but so, too, are her vulnerabilities. The polls have showed that many voters see her as a politician who plays by a different set of rules or is prepared to bend the rules in her favor. She has been criticized as overly defensive when challenged, slow to acknowledge errors and legalistic in explaining herself. She prefers to shield herself from more questioning from the reporters who regularly cover her campaign, having not held a full-fledged news conference for more than 260 days. Clinton’s friends say that her penchant for defensiveness and secrecy is the product of a quarter-century of attacks from her critics, what she long ago called a vast right-wing conspiracy. By now, it is baked in. Even some of the people who have the highest admiration for her intelligence, her work ethic and her commitment to finding good policies to address major problems see this as a genuine liability that could hamper her if she becomes president. Her allies say that as president, Clinton would be committed to finding some common ground with Republicans. But what happens if Republican attacks continue? A recent story in The Washington Post, based on the files of Diane Blair, one of Clinton’s closest friends from Arkansas, described the then-first lady as constantly frustrated during her husband’s administration that, when under attack, others in the White House were not sufficiently strong in going after the critics. The story said that it was Clinton who was “urging hardball” in those situations. “Month after month, Clinton was ‘in despair,’ her friend [Blair] wrote, that nobody in the White House was ‘tough and mean enough,’ ” according to the article. Clinton’s image deteriorated during her nomination contest with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. She emerged as one of the two least-liked presidential candidates in the modern history of presidential politics. It is her good fortune that the least liked is Trump. However much she is distrusted, Trump is distrusted more. Although a majority of voters do not believe she is honest, when asked which of the two major party nominees is more honest, she rates ahead of her Republican opponent. Her recent characterization of FBI Director James B. Comey’s comments about her use of a private email server as secretary of state earned negative ratings from media fact checkers. Only after it was apparent that her version of what Comey had said was no longer defensible did she pull back, saying she had “short-circuited” her explanation during an interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News, which she said led to a misunderstanding of what she meant. The email issue isn’t going away. The FBI director said his agency’s review found no grounds for prosecution. But he was sharply critical of her for being “extremely careless” with classified information. The FBI has sent to Capitol Hill the records of her interview with the agency. Clinton campaign officials now worry that her opponents will leak selected portions of those findings. Meanwhile, as part of an ongoing public records lawsuit, a federal judge ruled Friday that Clinton must answer under oath written questions from the conservative organization Judicial Watch about the use of the email server. The Clinton campaign sees the lawsuit as right-wing harassment, but the judge’s decision means the email controversy will continue, no doubt through the end of the campaign. More than questions about emails have swirled around Clinton throughout the campaign. The same holds for the role of the Clinton Foundation, which became a source of a controversy again after Judicial Watch released emails that it had received through its lawsuit. The emails revealed a request from a foundation official and longtime adviser to Bill Clinton seeking a State Department meeting on behalf of Gilbert Chagoury, a wealthy Nigerian businessman of Lebanese descent, who had given a substantial amount of money to the foundation. Clinton officials note that nothing ever came of the request. Trump and Republicans nonetheless have called it a sign of a “pay to play” operation. The foundation is seen as a source of good works, but it has long been a magnet for such criticism, characterized by critics as a conduit for wealthy individuals and foreign and U.S. entities seeking to curry favor with a past and, more important, a possible future president. Clinton campaign officials have said Clinton never took any action as secretary of state on behalf of foundation donors. Late last week, officials at the Clinton Foundation announced that if she becomes president, the foundation would no longer accept contributions from foreign governments or corporations. The decision, which would be a major blow to the foundation’s finances, is designed to prevent questions about conflicts of interest if she is in the White House. But the announcement raised obvious questions: Why now and not when she was secretary of state, and why not immediately? The explanation offered for the new, more restrictive policy if Clinton becomes president is that it would not be possible to have the same kind of review and appeals process that existed when she was at the State Department, which included possible White House involvement, because there is no executive-branch entity above the White House. Clinton officials argue that the past and newly proposed safeguards go beyond anything required by law. That has not satisfied critics. Trump’s week of problems also overshadowed two other developments affecting the Obama administration. One was the acknowledgment of a direct connection between the release of American hostages from Iran last winter and the payment of $400 million to the Iranian government. Administration officials said the payment was held back until the hostages were clearly being released and said that although the money was used as leverage, it was not a ransom payment. Then there was the announcement by Aetna that it would pull out of the Affordable Care Act exchanges in 11 of the 15 states where it has been operating. Aetna joined other insurance companies that had previously scaled back their participation in the new health-care system. The decision represented another blow to the signature domestic policy initiative of the Obama presidency, which Clinton has championed. If Trump were a more disciplined candidate, it’s likely these other issues would have been much more the focus of the past week. Clinton should send her rival a note of thanks.

1,"Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and his family filed a federal lawsuit Monday against the Iranian government, claiming he was taken hostage and psychologically tortured during his 18 months in prison in an effort by Tehran to influence negotiations for a nuclear agreement with Iran. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, says Rezaian was targeted for arrest to gain advantage in a prisoner exchange and to “extort” concessions from the U.S. government in the multinational talks over lifting sanctions if Iran agreed to limits on its nuclear program. Iranian officials repeatedly told Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who also was detained  for more than two months, that Rezaian had “value” as a bargaining chip for a prisoner swap, the suit says. The filing also links key moments in the nuclear negotiations to Rezaian’s treatment in the judicial system, from arrest to conviction to sentencing, and ultimately his release on the day the deal was implemented. “For nearly eighteen months, Iran held and terrorized Jason for the purpose of gaining negotiating leverage and ultimately exchanging him with the United States for something of value to Iran,” the suit states. Rezaian; his brother, Ali Rezaian; and their mother, Mary Rezaian, are asking for an unspecified sum for damages under the “terrorism exception” to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. That law generally bars U.S. citizens from suing foreign governments in domestic courts, but exceptions are made for terrorist acts, torture or hostage-taking by countries, including Iran, that the State Department has designated as state sponsors of terrorism. The suit accuses Iran of all three. Rezaian and Salehi, who was born in Iran and married Rezaian there, were arrested on July 22, 2014, by Iranian agents wearing surgical masks who forced their way into the couple’s apartment and took them for questioning at Evin prison, a notorious site for political prisoners. Salehi was freed 71 days later on a $32,000 bail provided by her brother-in-law, Ali. Rezaian was eventually tried and convicted on espionage and related charges, according to Iranian state media accounts. But the Iranian government has never officially disclosed the specifics of his conviction in a closed-door trial or the sentence imposed by a judge known for meting out harsh punishments. The lawsuit provides details of Rezaian’s incarceration that had never before been publicly revealed. Both Rezaian and Salehi were repeatedly subjected to psychological and physical abuse during lengthy interrogations, the suit says. Their captors at turns threatened to dismember or execute them. Interrogated in isolation and often deprived of sleep, each also was warned that the other might be maimed or executed, and that the same fate could befall other family members in Iran, according to the filing. The ordeal was so intense that Rezaian, Salehi and Rezaian’s brother, Ali, all contemplated suicide, the suit says. Now — almost nine months after Rezaian and four other U.S. citizens were released on the day the nuclear deal was implemented — Salehi, the Rezaian brothers and their mother are still afflicted with trauma and guilt, according to the suit. “For 544 days, Jason suffered such physical mistreatment and severe psychological abuse in Evin Prison that he will never be the same,” the suit states. “He will require specialized medical and other treatment for the rest of his life.” Salehi is not a plaintiff in the suit. Nor is The Washington Post. Rezaian is on leave from The Post for a year as a Nieman fellow at Harvard University. “Iran’s unconscionable actions have inflicted deep and lasting wounds on The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian and his family,” said Executive Editor Martin Baron, who during the reporter’s imprisonment often criticized what he called Iran’s “system of injustice.” “This legal filing is a stark telling of Iran’s brutal and heartless treatment of an innocent journalist and his wife, and the impact on those who love him. While this legal action is being taken solely by Jason and his family, The Post continues to support the Rezaians through their long and painful recovery.’’ The Rezaian lawsuit is the latest attempt by Americans to have the U.S. justice system provide compensation for harms inflicted by the Iranian government — in particular, by the powerful and hard-line Revolutionary Guard Corps, which fiercely opposed the nuclear deal and has tried to thwart many initiatives of President Hassan Rouhani, a relative pragmatist. The corps is named as a co-defendant in the suit. “This was really one of the few ways they felt they could try to hold Iran publicly accountable,” said David Bowker, Rezaian’s attorney. “Ideally, it will deter this kind of behavior toward other innocent people.” Rezaian and his family declined to discuss the case, referring questions to their lawyer. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not reply to an email requesting comment. In a number of suits brought against it over the years, Iran has not responded, resulting in default judgments. Congress and U.S. courts have provided a legal framework for Americans to sue Iran and be compensated. The State Department has labeled Iran the top state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Sudan and Syria are also on the list. In April, the Supreme Court upheld a law allowing American victims of terrorism and their families to collect almost $2 billion in seized Iranian assets. The case involved relatives of people killed or injured in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut. Iran labeled the decision “confiscation” and “theft.” The closest precedent to Rezaian’s case involves Nik Moradi, an Iranian American who was seized during a family visit in 2007 and accused of spying for the United States. More than six months before his release on bail, he said, he was subjected to physical and mental torture during interrogations. In 2013, Moradi and his wife sued Iran in U.S. federal court under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The couple was awarded $20 million in a default judgment after Iran failed to respond. One possible venue for securing payment on a judgment is the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, created last year by Congress to compensate the Americans held hostage in Iran during the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran after the 1979 revolution. It also set aside money for victims with court judgments against state sponsors of terrorism, funded by money from a civil penalty paid by BNP Paribas bank for violating sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan. The lawsuit provides dark glimpses of Rezaian’s 50 days in solitary confinement in a small, dank, cockroach-infested cell. Anxiety and depression made him hallucinate, as he perceived the walls moving and talking. The cell was constantly lighted, and a noisy fan hindered his sleep. Rezaian slept on the floor, and prison officials eventually gave him tranquilizers to induce sleep. His food sometimes had concrete, rocks, dirt and other inedible objects mixed in. “During his time in solitary confinement, Jason believed he was losing his mind,” the suit says. In the initial months of his imprisonment, Rezaian was taken blindfolded several times a day to an underground room for interrogations that lasted hours. He was forced to write down his answers, which prison officials translated into Farsi before trying to coerce him to sign without explaining the translations. In an effort to get Rezaian to confess to espionage, the suit says, one interrogator threatened him with beheading. Another held out the carrot of a video confession as his only chance for freedom. “They threatened Jason with physical mutilation, such as cutting off his limbs, and repeatedly told Jason that he would never see Yeganeh alive again,” the suit says. Though Salehi is not a plaintiff, her agony is clear in the suit’s dry legalese. During her detention, Salehi was blindfolded as interrogators hit the table, broke glass and kicked her chair, startling her. One interrogator threatened to cut off her left leg and right hand or arm. They told her they would throw her husband off a cliff if she did not incriminate him. By the time she was released, her legs would go numb and she sometimes fainted when sitting down. She had to shear off her hair because it was so matted. She had skin lesions. On her infrequent visits to the prison to see her husband, she sometimes was made to don a prison uniform and told she might be detained again, the suit says. Convinced that her husband would die in Evin prison, she considered killing herself to draw attention to his plight. Ali Rezaian, who quit his job to work full time campaigning for his brother’s release, also grew despondent, according to the suit. Iranian agents tailed him when he went to Geneva to appeal for help from the U.N. Human Rights Council, and his mother was held against her will in Iran. “He contemplated suicide in the fall of 2015, having lost faith that his brother would ever be released,” the suit states. “At the time, Ali believed that only by ending his own life could he prompt action by defendants or others, to free Jason.” Jason Rezaian now experiences depression, sleeplessness, short-term memory loss and other symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, the suit says. He grows anxious in large crowds, fears for his family’s safety and has grown more “detached” from them. He sees a psychologist. “Plaintiffs live in constant fear that Iranian agents are spying on them, plotting additional acts of terrorism and planning ways to hurt them and their family members again,” the suit says.

0,"PRESIDENT OBAMA’S foreign-policy legacy will include significant, if temporary, curbs on Iran’s nuclear program — but not the broader detente with the Islamic republic that he hoped for. More and bitter evidence of that came Tuesday, when Tehran announced that two American citizens and a permanent U.S. resident had been sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of “cooperating with the hostile U.S. government.” Siamak Namazi, 45, a businessman born in Iran, was an advocate of better relations and more trade between the two countries — which is probably the reason he was arrested while visiting the country a year ago. His 80-year-old father, Baquer, a former UNICEF official, was cruelly imprisoned after he traveled to Tehran in February. His family pointed out that the father’s prison term amounts to a death sentence, given his relatively poor health, for the “crime” of seeking to help his equally innocent son. The Namazis are not the only dual nationals suffering persecution in Tehran.

More and bitter evidence of that came Tuesday, when Tehran announced that two American citizens and a permanent U.S. resident had been sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of “cooperating with the hostile U.S. government.” Siamak Namazi, 45, a businessman born in Iran, was an advocate of better relations and more trade between the two countries — which is probably the reason he was arrested while visiting the country a year ago. His 80-year-old father, Baquer, a former UNICEF official, was cruelly imprisoned after he traveled to Tehran in February. His family pointed out that the father’s prison term amounts to a death sentence, given his relatively poor health, for the “crime” of seeking to help his equally innocent son. The Namazis are not the only dual nationals suffering persecution in Tehran.

1,"Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who spent 18 months detained in an Iranian prison before his release in January, will write a book about his ordeal for Ecco. The memoir, tentatively titled “Hostage: 544 Days, 400 Million Dollars, the Nuclear Deal & Me,” is scheduled for publication in 2018. “Not knowing when I would get out was an incredible ordeal for my family and me to endure,” says Rezaian, who is studying at Harvard on a Nieman Fellowship. “Now that it’s over, the hard work of putting my life back together continues, and that, too, has included many incredible and often surreal moments.” Rezaian, 40, was born in San Francisco to an Iranian father and an American mother and was raised in Marin County, Calif. He had lived in Iran since 2009 as a freelance journalist before joining The Washington Post in 2012 as Tehran correspondent. The book will share his experiences growing up as an Iranian American in the United States and reporting from Iran, as well as the story of his imprisonment. Rezaian says, “I’m looking forward to the opportunity to tell this exciting story, which, while intensely personal, also deals with one of the biggest international news stories of recent times.” The book was acquired by food-and-travel-focused TV host Anthony Bourdain, who has an imprint with Ecco, a division of HarperCollins. Rezaian and his wife, journalist Yeganeh Salehi, were filmed in 2014 for CNN’s “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown” program about Iran weeks before the couple’s arrest in July. Salehi, who was born in Iran, was detained for more than two months. “It’s an important story. Harrowing and suspenseful, yes. But it’s also a deep dive into a complex and egregiously misunderstood country with two very different faces,” Bourdain says. “There is no better time to know more about Iran, and Jason Rezaian has seen both of those faces — the warmth and hospitality of the people, and the cruelty and absurdity of its security apparatus. I am very proud to be publishing him and grateful to have him back.” Rezaian was tried on espionage and related charges in a closed-door trial. He spent 544 days in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison in the wing for political prisoners, 49 of them in solitary confinement. In October, Rezaian and his family filed a federal lawsuit against the Iranian government, claiming that he was psychologically tortured and used to influence concessions from the U.S. government in Iran’s nuclear negotiations. “I follow news from Iran very closely still,” he says, “especially the stories of dual nationals like me, who are currently being held hostage there for political reasons.” Rezaian is a Terker Distinguished Fellow at George Washington University’s School of Media & Public Affairs, where he delivers a monthly guest lecture. Since his release, “I’ve spent my time recuperating and reconnecting with my family, friends and colleagues,” he says. “I’m catching up on all that happened while I was gone, eating food that I love — burritos, lobster rolls and a lot of ramen — and following the Golden State Warriors with passion.” And, now, writing his memoir.","Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who spent 18 months detained in an Iranian prison before his release in January, will write a book about his ordeal for Ecco.

0,"Iran’s short, intense presidential campaign kicks off Friday with the first televised debate featuring six candidates in a race widely seen as a referendum on whether Iranians feel they have benefited from the nuclear deal that took effect last year. The May 19 vote will see the moderate incumbent, President Hassan Rouhani, facing off against conservative and reformist challengers, including a hard-line cleric with backing from the country’s religious establishment. Iran’s influential Guardian Council, a body of senior clerics and jurists appointed by the supreme leader, vets the candidates each election. This year, Rouhani’s approved challengers include the hard-line mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf; a conservative former culture minister, Mostafa Mirsalim; Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, a moderate; and former vice president Mostafa Hashemitaba, a reformist. Also on the list, which was whittled down from the 1,600 or so who initially registered, is Ebrahim Raisi, a confidant of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the man now viewed as Rouhani’s main rival. When the Guardian Council weighed in last week, it disqualified former president and populist firebrand Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Raisi, a cleric with a bloody past as one of several judges who oversaw mass executions of political prisoners in 1988, has been mentioned as a possible successor to Khamenei. The supreme leader dictates Iran’s military and foreign policy, but whoever wins the presidency could nevertheless ultimately determine the tone of Tehran’s engagement with the world and with a more confrontational Trump administration. The race was expected to be a cakewalk for Rouhani, who oversaw the negotiations that lifted many sanctions against Iran in exchange for constraints on its nuclear program. Most Iranian presidents have coasted to second terms. But the moderate leader is facing head winds in the wake of the deal he championed, and many Iranians say their living standards have not improved as they expected. Rouhani’s opponents have attacked him over the sluggish economy, blasting his strategy of opening up to the West in the hopes of attracting more investment. According to the International Monetary Fund, Iran’s real gross domestic product grew by 7.4 percent over the past year — but the growth was mainly due to oil exports. Unemployment runs over 12 percent. In an authoritarian country such as Iran, which hinders the work of independent journalists and pollsters, political predictions are notoriously inaccurate. Dark-horse candidates have emerged at the last minute to sweep to victory. And there is always the issue of how much it actually matters who is president. “The only thing you can say with decent certainty is that the day after the elections, Ayatollah Khamenei will still be the most powerful man in the country,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran analyst for the Carnegie Endowment. All six candidates on Friday will participate in the first of three debates, focusing on social issues. That exchange will be followed by debates on politics and the economy. The nuclear deal will probably be raised in all three, and that could hurt Rouhani, 68. “Rouhani is suffering in part from his own success,” said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group. “Expectations skyrocketed after the deal. But if you ask the average citizen the Ronald Reagan question — Is your life better than it was yesterday? — you’re going to get no. That’s his potential vulnerability.” In a jab at Rouhani’s Achilles’ heel, Raisi has vowed that, if elected, he will fight poverty, corruption and unemployment. One in four Iranians under the age of 25 is jobless. Raisi, 56, does not come by populism naturally. He is known to older Iranians as one of four judges on the “Death Commission,” a tribunal that oversaw the executions of 30,000 people in 1988, most of them members of the opposition Mujahideen-e Khalq, or MEK. He wears a black turban, signifying in Shiite Islam that he is a descendant of the prophet Muhammad. He rose quickly through the ranks and was the attorney general until last year. He is considered a protege of Khamenei, who appointed him to head the Astan Quds Razavi, the largest and wealthiest charity foundation in charge of Iran’s holiest shrine, in the city of Mashhad. Raisi routinely visits poor neighborhoods and villages to distribute sugar and flour, giving him a constituency among working-class Iranians. If he wins the election, it will increase the likelihood that he will succeed Khamenei, who is 77 and is said to have been treated for prostate cancer. If he loses, his viability diminishes. As a creature of the religious and judicial establishment, Raisi has advantages that could propel him to victory if moderates and reformists stay home to register their disappointment in Rouhani. “He doesn’t have to be very popular to win,” said Alireza Nader, an Iran analyst with the Rand Corp. “He’s the regime’s preferred candidate, especially the supreme leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.” In a close election, that could make the difference. “Unlike Rouhani, who in 2013 had popular support and not the elite support, Raisi has elite support,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “It might be willing to cheat to make him president.” The election of Raisi could heighten the risk of confrontation between Tehran and Washington. On Wednesday, the cleric said on a television talk show that the United States will back off sanctions only if it “fears” Iran. “Today, Americans are afraid of the word ‘Iran,’ ” he said, adding: “The solution is not backing down. We must force them to retreat.” The Trump administration has signaled its willingness to reconsider the nuclear deal and impose stricter sanctions to contain Iran if it continues to conduct ballistic missile tests and expand its influence in the region. Rouhani’s reelection could undermine international support for that strategy. “If you have an Iranian president who retains confidence among key partners in Europe and Asia, that will necessarily make the Trump administration’s agenda of getting tough more difficult,” said Suzanne Maloney, a Middle East analyst at the Brookings Institution. “If you have someone with a notorious background like Raisi, there will be a different kind of engagement across the board.” Cunningham reported from Istanbul.","Iran’s short, intense presidential campaign kicks off Friday with the first televised debate featuring six candidates in a race widely seen as a referendum on whether Iranians feel they have benefited from the nuclear deal that took effect last year.

0,"Correction: An earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly reported the amount of time Fariba Kamalabadi and Mahvash Sabet have served in prison in Iran. They are now in their tenth year behind bars. Roxana Saberi is an Iranian American journalist and author who was imprisoned in Iran for 100 days in 2009.  The most valuable gift I ever received took four years to pass through several hands and cross half the world to get to me. It’s a bracelet made from the threads of a towel I left behind in Tehran’s Evin prison. Whenever I wear the pink-and-rose-colored band, I think of Fariba Kamalabadi, the woman who wove it, and her friend Mahvash Sabet — two of my former cellmates, who are now serving their tenth year behind bars. I haven’t seen the two women since shortly before I was released in 2009, but they continue to inspire me and many others who know them or have heard their story. Fariba and Mahvash, along with five male colleagues, had tended to the spiritual and social needs of Iran’s minority Bahais, who are viewed as heretics by the Islamic regime. For this, the seven were accused of “spreading propaganda against the regime” and “engaging in espionage” — charges they deny. They were each given 20-year sentences, which reportedly have been reduced to 10 years. Despite the serious nature of their situation, Mahvash and Fariba exuded a peace that I felt the moment I was transferred to their cell. They welcomed me gently and cleared a space for the blankets that served as my bed. I sat down and asked how long they’d been there. “One year,” Mahvash said. “Ten months,” Fariba said. And yet they were still smiling. I asked them how they could remain so calm. “We trust in God to do what is best for our community,” Mahvash replied. “If he thinks we can serve our faith better by remaining here, we accept it.” One of Fariba’s relatives recently described this perspective to me: “Fariba believes if you want to make a positive change in the world, you need to pay a price.” “Though they were in prison, their spirits seemed unshackled,” recalled another former prisoner, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “They taught me to see my imprisonment as part of my destiny. I stopped asking, ‘Why me?’ and could tolerate even solitary confinement.” Mahvash and Fariba helped me, too, to accept the reality of my situation — to let go of regret for not fleeing my Tehran apartment before four intelligence agents forced their way in to arrest me, and to stop yearning for an earthquake to split open the prison walls. Bad things happen to all of us, my cellmates reminded me. What matters is how we deal with them. The two women dealt with their circumstances by making the most of every day. They exercised in their cells, discussed the books they were allowed to read and asked me to teach them English phrases. (For fun, I also taught them a few choice curse words.) Mahvash and Fariba also taught me compassion, even for our interrogators, who subjected us to relentless questioning, pressured us to confess to false charges and threatened us with long sentences and even execution. When I asked if they ever became angry, Mahvash replied, “We believe in love and compassion for humanity, even for those who wrong us.” Mitra Aliabouzar, who was a student activist when she met Mahvash and Fariba in Evin prison in 2012, described them as “selfless.” By that time, they had been transferred to the prison’s general ward with more than 20 other female political prisoners of disparate ideologies and faiths. The inmates became friends and worked together to keep the ward clean. “One time I accidentally overslept,” Mitra remembered. “It was my turn to clean the bathroom, but Fariba cleaned it for me” — though she had a bad back. Fariba, a psychologist, also gave advice to inmates who came to her with personal problems. “She obviously had a lot of issues on her plate,” Mitra said, “but she wouldn’t talk about her troubles. Instead, she listened.” Mahvash, who had been an elementary school principal before Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, began sharing her poetry with other prisoners. A number of her poems were published outside Iran, in English, in 2013. In “Place of Peril,” she suggests she will never be silenced: If they cut open our veins, red tulips will blush like blood in the fields If they padlock our lips, the mouths of a thousand spring buds are unsealed. The seven Bahai leaders are expected to be released next year. Like many other prisoners, Mahvash, now 64, and Fariba, 54, long to return to their families, feel the sunshine on their skin and smell the fragrance of trees. Every time I wear my bracelet made from my prison towel, I am reminded of the light of their kindness, compassion and courage. By all accounts, it has only intensified over the past nine years.

0,"Regarding the July 27 editorial “The hostages in Iran”: The Trump administration must intensify and maintain pressure on Iran until every American hostage is released. Last week, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan resolution I introduced with Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), Theodore E. Deutch (D-Fla.) and Ted Poe (R-Tex.) that urges President Trump to take meaningful action to secure the release of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents held hostage by Iran.

Only this lockout wasn’t intentional, although one couldn’t be blamed for having suspicions, given that the locked-out owner in question was Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys. After the Cowboys’ 19-13 loss to the Atlanta Falcons, Jones was seen pounding on the locker-room door by Matt Barrie of the NBC Dallas affiliate. “It’s the angriest I’ve seen him all year,” Barrie tweeted. Jones eventually was allowed into the locker room, Barrie told “NFL AM” on Monday. Tough ending for a tough night for Jones, whose team dropped to 3-5. Before the game, he was forced to admit by NBC’s Bob Costas that if the Cowboys’ general manager were anyone not named Jerry Jones, he’d have fired him by now. “Well, I think so … because he was there to dismiss,” Jones said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “I’ve always worked for myself, and you can’t do that. You basically have to straighten that guy out in the mirror when you work for yourself. But certainly, if I’d had the discretion, I’ve done it with coaches, and certainly I would have changed a general manager.” So if he isn’t about to fire the GM, what about the coach — especially if, say, Sean Payton were available? “I have a lot of faith in Jason,” Jones said of Jason Garrett, who is 11-13. “Jason’s future is ahead of him. I know how hard he works. I like his philosophy, so I’ve got a lot of confidence, a lot of faith.

0,"From the streets of Cairo to the Great Hall in Beijing, 2012 was a busy year for international news. The Washington Post also published a series of stories on the legacy of the war in Afghanistan, highlighting what the United States is leaving behind after a decade-long military presence in the country. Another series focused on the dramatically changing demographics in Mexico, a country also ravaged by a drug war and where the middle class is becoming the new majority. Here we highlight some reports from our correspondents in places that made the headlines, along with others from places that did not. Armored SUV could not protect U.S. agents in Mexico Nick Miroff and William Booth, Mexico City, February 15, 2012 In February 2011, a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent was shot while traveling in a sport-utility vehicle on a busy highway in Mexico. Miroff and Booth revisited the incident, reporting how an American agent in an armored vehicle was killed in broad daylight. Forced off the road in a well-coordinated ambush, surrounded by drug cartel gunmen brandishing AK-47s, Zapata and his partner, Victor Avila, rolled to a stop. Zapata put the vehicle in park.  The door locks popped open. That terrifying sound — a quiet click — set into motion events that remain under investigation. When Zapata needed it most, the Suburban’s elaborate armoring was rendered worthless by a consumer-friendly automatic setting useful for family vacations and hurried commuters but not for U.S. agents driving through a red zone in Mexico."" The man who retrieves the Taliban's dead Kevin Sieff, Kandahar, Afghanistan, February 20, 2012 Have you ever wondered what happens to a dead insurgent once a firefight is over in some dark alley in Afghanistan or after he has blown  himself up in a suicide attack? Sieff traveled to Kandahar to profile the man who gets the first calls from Taliban commanders in such cases. The Taliban knows Hakim as the man who can retrieve insurgents’ bodies from American and Afghan authorities and return them to their families and comrades. In the past six years, he has done it 127 times, carrying letters of permission from both the Afghan government and the Taliban as he weaves through 
Kandahar in a beat-up yellow taxicab, with dead insurgents in the trunk. Black bags for those killed in firefights. Small wooden boxes for what’s left of suicide bombers. Acid attacks in Colombia reflect rage Juan Forero, Bogota, Colombia, August 3, 2012 Acid attacks, long known as one of the quickest  -- and most gruesome -- means of destroying a woman's face in South Asian countries, have been on the rise in Colombia, where the phenomenon has terrified women and shocked prosecutors, according to Forero. If a woman is attacked over a dowry in India or because she ventured outside without a veil in Pakistan, in Colombia a woman might be attacked because of sheer rage over her independence or even by a disturbed man she doesn’t know. That’s what happened in 2004 to Maria Cuervo when a complete stranger shouted, “This is so you don’t think you’re so pretty” and drenched her face with acid. Mostly, though, a jilted boyfriend or a husband intoxicated with jealousy is behind the attack. Hunger crisis raises fears of child marriage in Niger Sudarsan Raghavan, Maradi, Niger, July 9, 2012 Each day around the world, more than 25,000 girls under the age of 18 get married, according to rights groups. In Niger, which already has the highest rate of child marriage, the growing hunger crisis has added new fears about child marriage, especially among girls in areas where families are marrying off their daughters in exchange for dowries -- livestock, money, anything that can keep the family afloat. Raghavan traveled to Maradi, where he found that the government is having a hard time eliminating the practice. In the village of Madaroufa, Zahara Sani, 12, doesn’t want to go back to school. She wants to marry her 20-year-old fiance. As a bride price, the young man gave her father shoes, bracelets, earrings, perfume — and $260, a princely sum here. But a soldier in their village reported her father to authorities. A judge banned the wedding, and government social workers have warned the father that they will have him arrested if he allows his daughter to marry. The marriage has not been called off, and neither has the dowry been returned. And Zahara is determined. “I have four friends who are already married, and we are all the same age,” she said. “Why not me?” Anti-immigrant Golden Dawn rises in Greece Anthony Faiola, Athens, October 20, 2012 At a time when rising unemployment and poverty are hobbling Greece, a political party with an anti-immigrant rhetoric won its first-ever seats in parliament this year. Golden Dawn, Faiola reported, is willing to go to great lengths to fulfill its promise of a Greece for Greeks only. Its supporters — in some instances with the alleged cooperation of police — stand accused of unleashing a rash of violence since the party rose to national office, including the stabbings and beatings of immigrants, ransacking an immigrant community center, 
smashing market stalls and breaking the windows of immigrant-owned shops. Attacks have not stopped at foreigners. One Golden Dawn legislator slapped a left-wing female politician on national television. Party supporters have attempted to shut down performances of progressive theater. Activists see the party’s hand behind three recent beatings of gay men. German boys choir copes with cracking voices at a younger age Michael Birnbaum, Leipzig, Germany, April 7, 2012 The young voices of the 800-year old St. Thomas Boys Choir in Leipzig are deepening a little earlier than in the past, and the choir leaders say that is affecting the music. Birnbaum visited the choir in Leipzig, where J.S. Bach once served as a director, and found that recruitment efforts are now being doubled and boys being admitted at an even younger age. ... the St. Thomas boys are an institution. The 97 choir members, who range in age from 9 to 19, live in a boarding school on Sebastian-Bach Street.  There, the older boys — who sing the lower tenor, baritone and bass lines — look after the younger ones. All receive a rigorous musical education. Boys whose voices are changing, a process that takes between three months and a year, take a break from the choir to study music theory, do light voice training and sell tickets and CDs at concerts. The group performs 100 times a year and regularly tours around the world. In China's Central Party School, students intent on cultivating allies William Wan, Beijing, October 12, 2012 China's top school for Communist Party bureaucrats is facing a new problem -- how to make the teachings of Mao and Marx engaging for a new generation of party officials, many of whom are more interested in  cultivating allies and networks. Wan wrote that the middle-aged officials use networking to trade favors and make deals to further their own careers and wealth. The obsession with networking has alarmed leaders in China, who see it as symptomatic of larger problems threatening the party’s iron grip over the country — disillusionment with its communist ideals, irrelevance in the modern era and pervasive corruption. Ethical corrosion has led to families of top leaders reaping vast fortunes, officials flaunting 
luxury watches worth several times their monthly salaries, and scandals such as a railway minister accused of using ill-gotten wealth to 
keep his 18 mistresses happy. To counter such pressures, the school has strived in recent years to modernize its Marxist theories, overhaul its curriculum and enact stronger controls over students. Afghanistan sees rise in 'dancing boys' exploitation Ernesto Londono, Dehrazi, Afghanistan, April 4, 2012 In the decade since Afghanistan was freed from Taliban control, the country has seen a rise in the number of powerful, wealthy men exploiting young boys as sexual partners and objects of entertainment. Londono interviewed a group of men who had agreed to discuss their practice of ""bachi baza."" Sitting next to the 9-year-old Waheed, who was wearing a pink pants-and-tunic set called a shalwar kameez, Mirzahan said he opted to take on the boy because marrying a woman would have been prohibitively expensive. The two have not had sex, Mirzahan said, but that will happen in a few years. For now, Waheed is being introduced to slightly older “danc­ing boys.” “He is not dancing yet, but he is willing,” Mirzahan said with pride. Asked how he felt about becoming a dancing boy, Waheed responded shyly. “I feel so happy,” the boy said. “They are so beautiful.” A darker story behind North Korea's propaganda star Chico Harlan, Seoul, September 22, 2012 A 66-year old woman who had defected to South Korea returned to Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, and described her time in the South as ""miserable."" Harlan wrote that Pak Jong Suk, one of the only cases on record of a defector returning to the North, apologized for having left and then praised leader Kim Jong Eun for forgiving her treasonous actions. But he found there was more to the story. Those who knew Pak in South Korea, as well as South Korean government officials, say there’s a dark side to Pak’s rise to propaganda stardom. Her story, they say, is largely false and probably state-fed, and it exposes North Korea’s willingness to manipulate a citizen who returned not because she yearned for her homeland but because she feared for the safety of the son she left behind. “This is a case where North Korea used motherhood for a political purpose,” said Park Sang-hak, a defector and a friend of Pak’s in Seoul. Tensions among Alawites pose new challenge for Assad Liz Sly, Beirut, October 17, 2012 In recent weeks, the Syrian opposition has grown stronger, capturing more weapons as they managed to take over some military bases and airfields. But in addition to the rebels' growing momentum, Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad faces another big challenge -- discontent among the Alawite minority sect to which he belongs. Sly reported that although the Alawites support Assad, fear is growing that if the rebels win, Sunni Islamists will achieve political dominance. ... from the Alawite heartland of Syria’s northern coastal region, come whispers of intrigue and strains within the Assad clan itself. A shootout between members of the extended Assad family in the president’s ancestral home town of Qardaha late last month and the detention of a prominent Alawite activist by the regime offer hints of unease within the one segment of the population whose unwavering support for Assad has hitherto not been in question. [But] There is no indication that Alawites are on the verge of switching sides to join the fragmented and leaderless opposition, which has made little effort to welcome them. Bee Gees, burgers and gun battles in post-Gaddafi Tripoli Abigail Hauslohner, Tripoli, Libya, November 14, 2012 Tripoli is recovering after the revolution, which has drawn a flood of dreamers to the city. Although things have not changed as quickly as some Libyans might have wanted, the city is not as bad as it appears,  Hauslohner wrote. Tripoli is a spectacle of post-revolution paradoxes. It is a place where all of the successes and failures of the Arab Spring’s most thorough revolution go on stark display side by side, where one can brave a 
militia gun battle and shop for designer dresses in the space of an afternoon. Despite all the weapons floating around, there is relatively little crime. Libyans go to work and pick up groceries. Adults talk politics over cappuccinos. And teenagers chow down on burgers and blast pop music from their cars. Iran faces possible health-care crisis Jason Rezaian, Tehran, November 22, 2012 One of the areas where the impact of international sanctions on Iran is most visible is the country's medical sector, already suffering from poor management and diminishing state funds. Rezaian reported from Tehran that many medical workers have been told to prescribe drugs sparingly — or in many cases, not at all — to preserve resources. Hosseinali Shahriari, the head of parliament’s health committee, said this month that “the government is playing with our people’s health and is not assigning the approved finances.” Shahriari noted that the cost of chemotherapy has quadrupled in just the past year, and is now approximately $67,000 — out of reach for all but the wealthiest Iranians. “Practically speaking,” he said, “we have to tell a majority of such patients to go and die.” To read more of our foreign coverage, go to washingtonpost.com/world","From the streets of Cairo to the Great Hall in Beijing, 2012 was a busy year for international news.

0,"In his response to the State of the Union, Sen. Marco Rubio said: ""This idea – that our problems were caused by a government that was too small – it’s just not true. In fact, a major cause of our recent downturn was a housing crisis created by reckless government policies."" For obvious reasons, this argument is very popular on the right, but there's precious little to back it up. The core claim can be a bit slippery, but it tends to go something like this: the existence and affordability goals of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) were a major reason we had a subprime-driven housing bubble and then a crash. The only problem? Pretty much all the evidence on the housing crisis shows that that's not true. (As I don't believe Rubio is referencing them, I'm putting to the side the complicated debate on interest rates being ""far too low for far too long"" and policy, or the idea that there wasn't enough U.S. government debt in the 2000s [!] to meet the demand for safe assets. Though those are the debates people actually engaged with these questions are studying.) Let's go through some things we know. 1. Private markets, rather than the GSEs, created the subprime mortgage boom. The subprime mortgage boom and the subsequent crash are very much concentrated in the private market, not the public market. Subprime is a creature of the private label securitization channel (PLS) market, instead of the Government-Sponsored Entities (GSEs, or Fannie and Freddie). The fly-by-night lending boom, slicing and dicing mortgage bonds, derivatives and CDOs, and all the other shadiness of the mortgage market in the 2000s were Wall Street creations, and they drove all those risky mortgages. Here's some data to back that up: ""More than 84 percent of the subprime mortgages in 2006 were issued by private lending institutions... Private firms made nearly 83 percent of the subprime loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers that year."" As University of California, Irvine law professor David Min has argued, saying the government directly created either the housing bubble or subprime loans has a serious problem with the timing. ""From 2002-2005, [GSEs] saw a fairly precipitous drop in market share, going from about 50 percent to just under 30 percent of all mortgage originations. Conversely, private label securitization [PLS] shot up from about 10 percent to about 40 percent over the same period. This is, to state the obvious, a very radical shift in mortgage originations that overlapped neatly with the origination of the most toxic home loans."" 2. The Community Reinvestment Act and the GSE's affordability mission didn't cause the crisis. Many conservatives argue that the ""affordability goals"" of the GSEs, as well as the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which was created in the 1970s to make sure poor communities had access to credit, either directly or indirectly led to subprime loans. Research from the Federal Reserve by Neil Bhutta and Glenn B. Canner (helpfully summarized in this Randy Kroszner speech), argues that the CRA couldn't have been behind the subprime and housing bubbles. ""The very small share of all higher-priced loan originations that can reasonably be attributed to the CRA makes it hard to imagine how this law could have contributed in any meaningful way to the current subprime crisis."" Only six percent of higher-priced loans (their proxy for subprime loans) were extended by CRA-covered lenders to lower-income borrowers or CRA neighborhoods. A recent paper found that while the CRA might have introduced slightly larger risks in lending portfolios, extra loans done to meet CRA compliance weren't more likely to have higher interest rates, lower loan-to-value, or be balloon/interest-only/jumbo/buy-down mortgages, or hold other subprime characteristics. So it is unlikely that the CRA was priming the pump for subprime, or subtly encouraging subprime mortgages to be made by private lenders. Jason Thomas and Robert Van Order's research argues that subprime loans were only 5 percent of the GSEs' losses. The GSEs' affordability mission led them to buy the highly rated tranches of mortgage bonds, for which there was already a ton of demand and were not essential to the completion of the deals. 3. There's a lot of research to back this up and little against it. The United States' housing market is one of the most intensely studied capital markets in the world. What has other research found? From Min: Did Fannie and Freddie buy high-risk mortgage-backed securities? Yes. But they did not buy enough of them to be blamed for the mortgage crisis. Highly respected analysts who have looked at these data..including the 
nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, the 
Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, the 
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission majority, the 
Federal Housing Finance Agency, and virtually all academics, including the 
University of North Carolina, 
Glaeser et al at Harvard, and 
the St. Louis Federal Reserve [also 
here], have all rejected the Wallison/Pinto argument that federal affordable housing policies were responsible for the proliferation of actual high-risk mortgages over the past decade. 4. Conservatives arguments tend to blur the definition of subprime. Some, such as Ed Pinto of AEI, argue that the GSEs had huge subprime exposure if you create a new category that represents the risks of subprime more accurately. He created a new ""high risk"" category, which he then argues these high-risk loans were held by the GSEs. This argument blur categories together and obscures more than it reveals. David Min broke down the numbers, and there is more about this discussion here. Here's a graphic from Min, comparing Pinto's new ""high-risk"" category against subprime:  Even this new ""high risk"" category, introduced by AEI to supposedly show what the GSEs were taking on, shows that it isn't anything like subprime and is instead comparable to the national average. If you then take the logical step and divide it by private label, the numbers are even worse. Private label loans ""have defaulted at over 6x the rate of GSE loans, as well as the fact that private label securitization is responsible for 42 percent of all delinquencies despite accounting for only 13 percent of all outstanding loans (as compared to the GSEs being responsible for 22 percent of all delinquencies despite accounting for 57 percent of all outstanding loans)."" The issue isn't this fake ""high risk"" category, it is subprime and private label origination. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) panel looked carefully at this argument and also ended up finding it doesn't work. So those who blame the GSEs can't get the numbers to work when they make up categories. (Fun fact: These same conservatives sang a different tune before the crash. They argued that the CRA and the GSEs were getting in the way of getting risky subprime mortgages to risky subprime borrowers. See Should CRA Stand for 'Community Redundancy Act? from Cato in 2000 or AEI's Peter Wallison in 2004 arguing ""study after study has shown that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are failing to do even as much as banks and S&Ls in providing financing for affordable housing, including minority and low income housing."") 5. The government policy that likely made an impact were deregulatory actions. In 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which deregulated the derivatives market, in a lame duck session as a rider to an 11,000 page omnibus appropriation bill. A banking capital ""recourse rule"" in 2001 allowed the ratings agencies and private bank risk modelers to decide what banks should hold against risk. In 2003 the OCC preempted and overruled Georgia’s new anti-predatory lending laws. Alan Greenspan refused to enforce regulations on, or even investigate the wrongdoing of, the new subprime market during the 2000s. The 2005 bankruptcy reforms in BAPCPA, widely viewed as friendly if not written by the financial industry, codified the market practice of letting derivatives go to the front of the line in bankruptcy, helping create the conditions for shadow banking runs. These government actions all fall under the rubric of deregulation, or ""letting the market decide"" how to manage the rules of the financial sector, and they are more relevant to the actual crisis. Though these are government policies, and they were reckless, I doubt they are what conservatives like Rubio mean. Mike Konczal is a fellow with the Roosevelt Institute, and author of the blog Rortybomb.","In his response to the State of the Union, Sen. Marco Rubio said: ""This idea – that our problems were caused by a government that was too small – it’s just not true. In fact, a major cause of our recent downturn was a housing crisis created by reckless government policies."" For obvious reasons, this argument is very popular on the right, but there's precious little to back it up. The core claim can be a bit slippery, but it tends to go something like this: the existence and affordability goals of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) were a major reason we had a subprime-driven housing bubble and then a crash. The only problem? Pretty much all the evidence on the housing crisis shows that that's not true. (As I don't believe Rubio is referencing them, I'm putting to the side the complicated debate on interest rates being ""far too low for far too long"" and policy, or the idea that there wasn't enough U.S. government debt in the 2000s [!] to meet the demand for safe assets. Though those are the debates people actually engaged with these questions are studying.) Let's go through some things we know. 1. Private markets, rather than the GSEs, created the subprime mortgage boom. The subprime mortgage boom and the subsequent crash are very much concentrated in the private market, not the public market. Subprime is a creature of the private label securitization channel (PLS) market, instead of the Government-Sponsored Entities (GSEs, or Fannie and Freddie). The fly-by-night lending boom, slicing and dicing mortgage bonds, derivatives and CDOs, and all the other shadiness of the mortgage market in the 2000s were Wall Street creations, and they drove all those risky mortgages. Here's some data to back that up: ""More than 84 percent of the subprime mortgages in 2006 were issued by private lending institutions... Private firms made nearly 83 percent of the subprime loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers that year."" As University of California, Irvine law professor David Min has argued, saying the government directly created either the housing bubble or subprime loans has a serious problem with the timing. ""From 2002-2005, [GSEs] saw a fairly precipitous drop in market share, going from about 50 percent to just under 30 percent of all mortgage originations. Conversely, private label securitization [PLS] shot up from about 10 percent to about 40 percent over the same period. This is, to state the obvious, a very radical shift in mortgage originations that overlapped neatly with the origination of the most toxic home loans."" 2. The Community Reinvestment Act and the GSE's affordability mission didn't cause the crisis. Many conservatives argue that the ""affordability goals"" of the GSEs, as well as the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which was created in the 1970s to make sure poor communities had access to credit, either directly or indirectly led to subprime loans. Research from the Federal Reserve by Neil Bhutta and Glenn B. Canner (helpfully summarized in this Randy Kroszner speech), argues that the CRA couldn't have been behind the subprime and housing bubbles. ""The very small share of all higher-priced loan originations that can reasonably be attributed to the CRA makes it hard to imagine how this law could have contributed in any meaningful way to the current subprime crisis."" Only six percent of higher-priced loans (their proxy for subprime loans) were extended by CRA-covered lenders to lower-income borrowers or CRA neighborhoods.

0,"TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi has reiterated the possibility of direct negotiations with the United States, although his statement was less enthusiastic than comments he made in Germany 10 days ago. In an interview with the semi-official Mehr News agency published Saturday, he basically said that it's up to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to decide whether Iran will talk. I read this, like Ahmadinejad's speech last Sunday, as trying to bring Khamenei back into the dialogue as the decider. We should fully expect more developments on this leading up to the planned multi-nation talks in Kazakhstan on Feb. 26. Here's the Mehr News report: TEHRAN, Feb. 16 (MNA) –Iran Foreign Minister says that if the US proves that their intentions are true and honest, Iran will consider it with positive view. In an interview with Mehr News, Ali Akbar Salehi pointed to the final status of negotiation proposal by the US and said “we have two types of negotiations with the US, one is that we have comprehensive discussion on the political relationship, Supreme Leader will decide holding or not holding this kind of negotiation, and it is part of his authorities, and of course we have not had any such discussion, and if the time and conditions are ready, the Supreme Leader will decide about that.” Salehi called the other type of negotiations ‘thematic negotiations.’ “We negotiated with the US about Afghanistan, in Bern, Switzerland. We also talk to them about the crisis in Iraq, so you can see that we could have thematic negotiations with the US.” He also asserted that “even the thematic negotiations are done with Leader’s discretion and not anyone on his own can start a negotiation with the US.” It seems as if Iranian officials know they need to start talking but want to make the supreme leader more of a focal point. And this seems in line with the idea that Khamenei wants progress but doesn't want a deal until after the June presidential election.","TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi has reiterated the possibility of direct negotiations with the United States, although his statement was less enthusiastic than comments he made in Germany 10 days ago.

0,"TEHRAN- An ambitious photography project that was four years in the making opened to a strong reception in Tehran last week. Azadeh Akhlaghi’s “By an Eye Witness” is a unique undertaking in a country that has become known for its rich and diverse documentary photography scene, which draws on a wide range of topics, ethnicities, beliefs and cultural currents as well as Iran’s long and complex history. In “By an Eye Witness” Akhlaghi provides an experience that accomplishes something increasingly rare in the Islamic Republic, which is unifying Iranians around a common theme, in this case many of the tragic deaths in the country’s modern history. The project is even more compelling in that no photographs of these particular events, or the scenes that surrounded them, were taken at the time. Each image in the series of 19 photos is a reenactment of an event, painstakingly reconstructed by Akhlaghi, who used a combination of archived information, news reports and in many instances, accounts from  witnesses, many of whose recollections differed from one another. “This project is based on documents,” said Akhlaghi days before the opening, confident that she is presenting as accurate a picture as possible of her nation’s history, given the circumstances. The result is a powerful work that combines photography and history with a vivid cinematic feel. Some of the scenes include dozens of actors representing the people who were present at the scene of the deaths. One of those, for example, was a Shiite cleric who happened to preside over the mourning rituals in two deaths that happened nearly 20 years apart. Akhlaghi used the same actor in both shots and he is noticeably older in the latter of the two incidents. Among the subjects are figures from Iran’s revolution, clerics, leftists, artists and athletes. Assassinations, tortures, accidents, suspicious deaths and natural ones are all represented in the series, but each of the deaths represents a moment in Iran’s tumultuous modern history, crossing political and factional lines. They are moments to which all Iranians can relate. As Akhlaghi wrote in a statement about the exhibition, “It is about depiction of the moment of dying of the people who lived decently and passed bitterly, but there is something sacred about their death, which has been forgotten or stained.” By Iranian standards “By an Eye Witness” was an expensive project to produce, but the Mohsen Gallery, which is the main sponsor, believed deeply in the importance of the project. “There is something that everyone can sympathize with in these works,” said the gallery’s director, Ehsan Rasoulof. He decided to support the project because he believed it would resonate with Iranian audiences. “Is this part of our present, future, or past? I’m not sure,” he said at the opening. Akhlaghi said she was moved that some of the surviving relatives of her subjects attended the opening and that all of them, regardless of their political affiliations, had been supportive of her work. “One women who came to the opening was crying a lot. I went to her and told her that it was okay, and that I had cried a lot doing this project,” said Akhlaghi, adding that she had to put this project behind her and begin a new one or risk becoming depressed. The original inspiration for “By an Eye Witness,” according to Akhlaghi came in the aftermath of the 2009 election. “I was so shocked by the death of Neda,” referring to the shooting death of Neda Agha Soltan, who was killed during a post-election protest that was captured on cell phone video and broadcast all over the world.","TEHRAN- An ambitious photography project that was four years in the making opened to a strong reception in Tehran last week.

0,"Iran's journalists in chains from Committee to Protect Journalists on Vimeo. Journalism can be a tough gig for Iranians, who face secrecy and the risk of retribution, and it seems to be getting tougher. A video by the Committee to Protect Journalists shows a rising trend in reporters being imprisoned for such charges as ""insulting the supreme leader"" or ""spreading propaganda against the state;"" in other words, for doing journalism. Some have faced solitary confinement, forced confessions, even death. That trend started getting worse, the press freedom group says, shortly after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president in late 2005. And it got much, much worse after the disputed 2009 presidential election, in which mass protests called for a recount but were ultimately put down by security forces. Here, from a recent Committee to Protest Journalists report on Iranian press freedom abuses, is the cumulative – and, presumably, desired – effect of those arrests. (My emphasis added.) As devastating as the imprisonments are to the individual journalists and their families, the Iranian government’s tactics have had an intimidating effect on the press, choking off the flow of information. This census and CPJ’s past surveys are simply snapshots in time—they do not include the large numbers of journalists convicted of crimes or facing charges who are temporarily free on bail or furlough. Iran has pursued a revolving-door policy in imprisoning journalists, freeing some detainees on short-term furloughs even as they make new arrests. 
The pattern of rotating critical journalists in and out of prison has sown fear and self-censorship across the entire press corps, according to CPJ research. At least 68 Iranian journalists fled into exile between 2007 and 2012 due to harassment and the threat of imprisonment, according to CPJ research. 
Only Somali journalists have gone into exile in higher numbers during that period. The Washington Post's Jason Rezaian reported in January about Iranian journalists who had been arrested for allegedly working with foreign media such as the BBC.","Iran's journalists in chains from Committee to Protect Journalists on Vimeo.

0,"Five months ago, according to a new Reuters report, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi sent a handwritten letter to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei calling for Iran to reach out to Washington for ""broad discussions with the United States."" President Obama has been calling on Iran to do exactly that since he first took office in 2009, reiterating again and again that he wanted the two countries to resolve their issues directly. Khamenei, who has shown little public interest in accepting Obama's offers of direct talks, reportedly responded to Salehi's latter with a note stating that ""he was not optimistic but would not oppose them if they pursued the initiative,"" Reuters reported. The most significant news here may be that the letter signals that Khamenei is now being pressured to deal with Washington not only from the outside world but from his own government. Salehi's letter was sent in January, during a series of unusual signs that Iran might be willing to talk to Washington, which had rebuffed a 2003 Iranian offer for direct talks. In October, the New York Times reported that Iran and the United States had agreed in principal to hold direct negotiations. The Iranians insisted on waiting until after the U.S. presidential election, and some observers wondered if the United states might want to postpone until after Iran's own presidential election, to be held later this month. In the weeks after the October revelation, there were more hints that the two countries might be positioning themselves for direct talks, although there was nothing definitive and  Khamenei maintained his usual hard line against the United States. There have also been suggestions of a push-pull within the Iranian government over whether to talk to the Americans. A month after Salehi sent his secret letter to Khamenei, he publicly hinted on two occasions that Iran might be open to direct talks. Around the same time, though, Khamenei gave a speech that seemed to reject the possibility altogether. ""Some naive people like the idea of negotiating with America. However, negotiations will not solve the problem,” Khamenei said. “American policy in the Middle East has been destroyed, and Americans now need to play a new card. That card is dragging Iran into negotiations.” The Washington Post's Jason Rezaian, writing in February about Salehi's suggestions that Iran might be willing to talk, reiterated that it all comes down to Khamenei. ""It seems as if Iranian officials know they need to start talking but want to make the supreme leader more of a focal point,"" Rezaian wrote. ""And this seems in line with the idea that Khamenei wants progress but doesn’t want a deal until after the June presidential election."" It's possible that Tehran might soften after this month's election. But the government's decision to bar well-known moderates from running, thus formally rejecting the candidates most likely to support negotiations with the United States, does not augur well. Reuters got this crucial quote from expert on Iranian-American relations Karim Sadjadpour: Western powers hope [outgoing president Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad's successor will be someone who is on good terms with the supreme leader, avoids anti-Israeli rhetoric and supports serious negotiations on Iran's nuclear program. But the choice for Iranian voters is limited. Iran's reformists, who might be more inclined to compromise over the nuclear program, have been barred or sidelined in the election. The six carefully vetted presidential candidates are dominated by hardliners close to Khamenei. Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a leading Iranian-American expert on Khamenei, remains pessimistic that any deal can be struck with the United States while the 73-year-old Khamenei is alive. ""Those who want a deal can't deliver, and those who can deliver don't want a deal,"" Sadjadpour said. That's worth repeating: Those who want a deal can't deliver, and those who can deliver don't want a deal. So, in order for the Obama administration to get the direct negotiations in wants, one of two things has to happen: Either someone who wants a deal has to be elevated within the system – unlikely, given Khamenei's opposition to allowing a proponent of negotiations to run for president. Or someone who is already high-placed in the system has to change his mind about direct talks. That's one premise of sanctions; to change Khamenei's mind. But, despite the pressure from without and now apparently within Iran, he doesn't seem to be swaying.","Five months ago, according to a new Reuters report, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi sent a handwritten letter to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei calling for Iran to reach out to Washington for ""broad discussions with the United States."" President Obama has been calling on Iran to do exactly that since he first took office in 2009, reiterating again and again that he wanted the two countries to resolve their issues directly. Khamenei, who has shown little public interest in accepting Obama's offers of direct talks, reportedly responded to Salehi's latter with a note stating that ""he was not optimistic but would not oppose them if they pursued the initiative,"" Reuters reported. The most significant news here may be that the letter signals that Khamenei is now being pressured to deal with Washington not only from the outside world but from his own government. Salehi's letter was sent in January, during a series of unusual signs that Iran might be willing to talk to Washington, which had rebuffed a 2003 Iranian offer for direct talks. In October, the New York Times reported that Iran and the United States had agreed in principal to hold direct negotiations. The Iranians insisted on waiting until after the U.S. presidential election, and some observers wondered if the United states might want to postpone until after Iran's own presidential election, to be held later this month. In the weeks after the October revelation, there were more hints that the two countries might be positioning themselves for direct talks, although there was nothing definitive and  Khamenei maintained his usual hard line against the United States. There have also been suggestions of a push-pull within the Iranian government over whether to talk to the Americans. A month after Salehi sent his secret letter to Khamenei, he publicly hinted on two occasions that Iran might be open to direct talks. Around the same time, though, Khamenei gave a speech that seemed to reject the possibility altogether. ""Some naive people like the idea of negotiating with America. However, negotiations will not solve the problem,” Khamenei said. “American policy in the Middle East has been destroyed, and Americans now need to play a new card. That card is dragging Iran into negotiations.” The Washington Post's Jason Rezaian, writing in February about Salehi's suggestions that Iran might be willing to talk, reiterated that it all comes down to Khamenei. ""It seems as if Iranian officials know they need to start talking but want to make the supreme leader more of a focal point,"" Rezaian wrote. ""And this seems in line with the idea that Khamenei wants progress but doesn’t want a deal until after the June presidential election."" It's possible that Tehran might soften after this month's election. But the government's decision to bar well-known moderates from running, thus formally rejecting the candidates most likely to support negotiations with the United States, does not augur well. Reuters got this crucial quote from expert on Iranian-American relations Karim Sadjadpour: Western powers hope [outgoing president Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad's successor will be someone who is on good terms with the supreme leader, avoids anti-Israeli rhetoric and supports serious negotiations on Iran's nuclear program. But the choice for Iranian voters is limited. Iran's reformists, who might be more inclined to compromise over the nuclear program, have been barred or sidelined in the election. The six carefully vetted presidential candidates are dominated by hardliners close to Khamenei. Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a leading Iranian-American expert on Khamenei, remains pessimistic that any deal can be struck with the United States while the 73-year-old Khamenei is alive. ""Those who want a deal can't deliver, and those who can deliver don't want a deal,"" Sadjadpour said. That's worth repeating: Those who want a deal can't deliver, and those who can deliver don't want a deal. So, in order for the Obama administration to get the direct negotiations in wants, one of two things has to happen: Either someone who wants a deal has to be elevated within the system – unlikely, given Khamenei's opposition to allowing a proponent of negotiations to run for president.

0,"Ali Akbar Velayati, the former foreign minister of Iran and one of several candidates in this week's presidential election there, recently released a campaign video that might have been seen as a touch too personal even in the U.S. political context, where personality and performances rule all. The video showed him sitting in a darkened theater, weeping over archival footage announcing founding leader Ruhollah Khomeini's 1989 death. Velayati is not the first candidate in this Iranian presidential race to cry in public. According to Radio Liberty's Golnaz Esfandiari, former vice president Mohammad Reza Aref was recently asked during a state TV appearance about drug policy. During his answer, as he discussed the country's high rate of drug addiction, he wept right on camera. (Aref has since dropped from the race.) ""Iranian politicians often cry,"" Esfandiari explained, noting that it helps to humanize them and signal their concern for the now-significant plight of normal Iranians. In that way, they're not so different from politicians in any country. But, as Esfandiari and others have  noted, the trend is especially pronounced in Iran, with politicians crying with unusual frequency. Even confrontational President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has wept publicly, most recently at Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez's state funeral. One Iranian blogger, writing about the practice, wondered if it might be an effect of the ""mourning nature"" of Shi'ism, the branch of Islam to which most Iranians belong. Mourning is a central element of that sect. One of the religion's major holidays, Ashura, is meant to be a day of mourning for all Shi'a over the death, in 680 A.D., of Imam Hussein ibn Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. Many Shi'a communities still gather for elaborate public mourning ceremonies on Ashura that include crying. That doesn't mean that Velayati's weeping is really a subtle reference to Shi'a doctrine, of course. But Shi'ism's emphasis on the importance of public mourning and weeping may have played a role in both eroding the taboo against the practice (which is much stronger in the West than in many other societies) and in emphasizing the perception that it can be virtuous. The blogger who discussed Shi'ism's ""mourning nature,"" an anonymous Iranian who writes as Talented Moron, recounts this story about Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, the shah of Iran during the late 19th century. I can't verify whether the story is true, but the fact that it's been passed on says something about Iranian perceptions about what it means for a public leader to cry. It's translated into English by Radio Liberty's Golnaz Esfandiari: It is said that Naser al-Din Shah Qajar went to Karbala, and before entering the shrine of Imam Hussein, he said to his prime minister: Find me a person who delivers good sermons on the tragedy of Karbala so I can weep over it. In pursuance of his instructions, the prime minister went to find a few good ones. Whatever they recited, the shah did not weep!   The prime minister was afraid and told the clergy of Karbala that if the shah did not weep, things would go badly. They went and brought an unknown speaker. He was an old person, but one who was an expert and experienced. He told the prime minister, ""I will make the shah weep."" As soon as he approached the shah, he turned toward the grave of Imam Hussein and said: ""Oh Hussein, when you had lost all companions and were standing alone in the Karbala desert, you raised your voice to say, 'Is there any naser [helper in Arabic] to help me.' Now this Naser [the shah's name] has come, but it's too late.""   Upon hearing this, the shah burst into tears. His prime minister feared that something might happen to the shah, so he signaled to the speaker to stop.","Ali Akbar Velayati, the former foreign minister of Iran and one of several candidates in this week's presidential election there, recently released a campaign video that might have been seen as a touch too personal even in the U.S. political context, where personality and performances rule all.

0,"Whomever Iranians pick in today's presidential election, and regardless of whether or not their votes are accurately counted, the winner will not be in charge of the country's controversial nuclear program or its foreign policy. Those are controlled by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. But the nuclear issue and its ramifications are being debated more openly in this election than you might think and are, presumably, on voters' minds as they head to the polls. Who they choose might give some insights into how Iranians feel about the nuclear development carried out in their name. The candidate who has most emphasized confrontation over compromise on the nuclear issue is Saeed Jalili, the country's lead nuclear negotiator and a staunch hard-liner who is thought to be Khamenei's preferred candidate. As a nuclear negotiator, Jalili has refused to compromise and stonewalled Western efforts to reach an agreement. As a candidate, he's said not only that Iran should refuse to compromise with the West but that it is in fact winning against the foreign powers, its strategy of stubborn resistance successful. And some people in Iran seem to share that view. “Open your eyes,” one 20-something Iranian man told a friend who was considering another candidate, according to Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian's report from Tehran. “Everything we have now is because of Jalili and his courage.” That Jalili supporter might be more right than he knows. It would be overly simplistic to reduce all of Iran's problems to a single issue, but the country's refusal to budge on its nuclear program and the crippling international sanctions that has invited play a big role. Those policies are ultimately decided by Khamenei but Jalili had been a key player in implementing them. Partly as a result, run-away inflation is devastating the middle class, prices on basic necessities are rising and the Iranian health-care system could soon be in crisis. Jalili, meanwhile, is calling for status quo on the nuclear policy, a refusal to compromise with Western powers and a ""resistance economy"" that espouses self-sufficiency but has demonstrated little actual success. When the Jalili supporter said they owed ""everything we have"" to him, he hit, probably unintentionally, on the degree to which Iranians owe much of their economic and social pains, if not to Jalili directly, then to the confrontational policies he has helped to champion. Why would Iranian voters support Jalili? New York Times correspondent Thomas Erdbrink found some of his supporters who told him they ""don't care about the economy, but care about pure Islam."" Jalili has declared during the campaign, ""People should be ready to sacrifice everything for the discourse of pure Islam."" In Iran, celebrating ""pure Islam"" is as much about the country's revolutionary nationalism as it is about Islam itself, an official ideology that includes the same ""resistance"" motivating the nuclear program. Still, Jalili does not appear to be particularly popular. A recent poll showed him as the third-most popular candidate with modest 13.9 percent support. As Erdbrink tweeted from Tehran, ""Not too many saying they voted for nuclear negotiator Jalili. Many in Tehran say they fear his hard-line stance."" And The Post's Rezaian talked to a Web designer who said he'd decided his vote based on the candidate most likely to defeat Jalili. If Jalili wins, then we can infer that either the polls were wrong, turnout was wildly one-sided in his favor or, perhaps most likely, Khamenei or one of his offices intervened in the election in Jalili's favor. But Iranians can expect that a President Jalili, however he might get to office, would likely bring their country more of the resistance economy and pure Islam that has already bestowed them with international isolation and inflation as high as 110 percent.","Whomever Iranians pick in today's presidential election, and regardless of whether or not their votes are accurately counted, the winner will not be in charge of the country's controversial nuclear program or its foreign policy.

0,"In much of the world, soccer is one of the few events that stirs more emotions than a national election. Over a recent four-day period, Iran embraced the euphoria of both. On June 14, Iranians poured into polling places to elect Hassan Rouhani — an outcome that suggested a shift toward political moderation and repaired relations with the West. A few days later, some 4,000 miles away, the Iranian soccer team did its part for national pride by defeating South Korea to secure passage to the the 2014 World Cup in Brazil — its third berth in the past five attempts. Barely able to catch its breath, Tehran transformed political gatherings into soccer raves. In the case of the latter, the joy was unanimous. When the players returned home on a charter flight, 40,000 supporters awaited at the national stadium for a welcoming party that included speeches, introductions and victory laps with waving flags. Among those in the delegation: Iranian-American assistant coach Omid Namazi. “The people continued the celebrations night after night after night,” said Namazi, a member of Carlos Queiroz‘s staff for more than two years. “Qualifying for the World Cup is a big deal. And with the election, there is a lot of hope — a feeling things will get better, especially economically. It’s a good feeling in Iran right now.” Namazi, 47, was born in Utah while his father was a student at Brigham Young University. After spending much of his youth in Iran, Omid moved with his family to Alexandria, Va. While his father pursued a doctorate at the University of Maryland, Omid starred at West Virginia University. He then embarked on a playing and coaching career that spanned 22 years and approximately 18 U.S. cities, beginning in 1988 with the Washington Diplomats in the semipro American Soccer League. He also played locally for the Maryland Bays (outdoor) and Baltimore Spirit (indoor). Namazi returned to Iran in 2010 to serve as an assistant for one season with a small pro team, Steel Azin. He was planning to come back to the United States when Queiroz, a renowned Portuguese coach hired by the Iranian federation in April 2011, offered him a job. Namazi had played briefly for Queiroz when both were employed by the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in MLS’s 1996 inaugural season. Namazi knew the local scene and spoke the language. Iran’s other coaches have American ties, as well: Portugal’s Antonio Simoes played in U.S. leagues and Dan Gaspar is a Connecticut native and goalkeeping specialist. The mission: qualify for the World Cup. Iran breezed past the Maldives in the second round and finished atop its semifinal group to advance to the 10-nation Asian finals. Two teams from each of the two groups would earn automatic berths. South Korea and Iran were heavily favored in Group A, but Uzbekistan proved to be a nuisance until the very end. Entering the last set of matches, the Iranians sat second, one point behind Korea and two ahead of Uzbekistan. Finishing third would send them to a regional playoff and, if they were successful, an unenviable series against a South American side. In Ulsan, however, Dutch-Iranian forward Reza Ghoochannejad scored in the 60th minute for a 1-0 upset. Iran finished with a 5-2-1 record and 16 points — two ahead of both South Korea and Uzbekistan. The Koreans won the tiebreaker on goal difference and also clinched a World Cup berth, their eighth straight. Uzbekistan will play Jordan in a playoff this fall. The swirl of political activity back home was not forgotten. While the team was in South Korea, the Iranian Embassy provided a make-shift polling place in a meeting room at the team hotel. Most of the delegation cast ballots. With a World Cup place assured, Namazi and the coaching staff will turn its attention to Asian Cup qualifiers in Thailand and Lebanon and friendlies ahead of the Brazilian adventure next summer. (Iran was eliminated in the first round in each of its previous three World Cup appearances — 1978, 1998, 2006). Indentifying and introducing fresh talent to a veteran roster is a priority, Namazi said. For now, though, Namazi is in New Jersey visiting his two children, who live with his ex-wife near Philadelphia. Vacation involved a trip to Ocean City (N.J.). He will return to Tehran, where he lives with his retired parents, sometime after July 4. His contract expired after the qualifying stage and he is in the process of negotiating a new deal through the World Cup. “My life is here in the U.S. My family is here in the U.S.,” he said. “And in the future, I will be back working here in the U.S.”","In much of the world, soccer is one of the few events that stirs more emotions than a national election.

0," One and a half months into his tenure, and just one week before he  addresses the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sat down with NBC News on Wednesday. It was his first interview with the Western media since taking office, and it appears to be the latest move in his not-so-subtle campaign signaling to the United States that he's interested in ending decades of enmity. A snip of the interview is above; you can read NBC's write-up here. Here are three important take-aways from the parts of the interview that NBC has made available. The first two are great, positive signs that Rouhani and President Obama could find their way to a peace deal. The third is a bit more complicated. 1. He's got the supreme leader's okay to cut a nuclear deal. As Rouhani-skeptics often point out, the president is not the final authority in Iranian politics. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is ultimately in charge, especially on matters of national security and foreign policy. The best case for skepticism about Rouhani's peace overtures is that he's just freelancing and will inevitably be undercut by Khamenei. That's still possible, but Rouhani told NBC News that Khamenei gave him full authority to cut a deal with the West over Iran's nuclear program -- the single biggest sticking point of any negotiations. If true, then for Khamenei to hand Rouhani that power would be a remarkably positive step just in itself, a sign of institutional weight shifting toward compromise and diplomacy. That Rouhani could actually see it through is even better. As The Washington Post's Jason Rezaian reported earlier this week, Khamenei has issued several statements publicly embracing diplomacy over militancy -- a remarkable shift given his years of hard-line anti-Western rhetoric and action. 2. He's pen pals with Obama. A few days ago, Obama revealed that he had written to Rouhani after his election. Obama had also tried this with Khamenei a few years earlier but was rebuffed. Right about the same time as Rouhani's interview today, the White House revealed the gist of the president's letter: that the United States was ready to make a peace deal over the nuclear program and that it would tolerate a peaceful nuclear program. Rouhani didn't say much when asked about the letter, but his tone was positive and he did reveal that he wrote back to Obama. ""The tone of [Obama's] letter was positive and constructive,"" he said, calling their exchanges ""subtle and tiny steps for a very important future."" That's an analytically sound view of the letters, and one that implies both that action speaks louder than words and that Rouhani hopes for a lot more. More good news. 3. He denied that Iran will ever build a nuclear weapon. This is the one point that's gotten a lot of positive attention but about which I'm a touch less sanguine. Rouhani said that Iran will ""never under any circumstances develop a nuclear weapon."" As Matt Duss of the Center for American Progress Progress points out on Twitter, ""Iran regime has always denied it sought nuclear weapons, so Rohani's comments don't represent a concession. Still hugely positive, though."" This is, in other words, status quo. It also strains credulity a bit. Western intelligence agencies tend to believe that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon. But there are lots of signs that it is at least trying to give itself that option -- vast, clandestine nuclear-enrichment operations buried deep underground don't inspire the deepest confidences. Neither do recent reports, even since Rouhani's inauguration, that Iran is upgrading its enrichment facilities. So for Rouhani to state that Iran would full-stop never-ever develop a nuclear weapon is tough to square with the many indications that the country probably wants break-out nuclear capability. As I've written previously, some Rouhani skeptics believe that his peace outreaches are all a great ruse to hold the West at bay and give Iran more time to develop its nuclear program. That's not the prevailing view, but Rouhani is giving the skeptics a bit of a boost here. To be fair, ""we will never build a nuclear weapon"" has been Tehran's stated position for so long that Rouhani is not really in a position to contradict it. Still, if I were to imagine the most promising possible thing that he could have said, it might include at least some subtle nod to, for example, Iran's long-standing fear of Western attacks or its desire to defend itself. The possibility of an Iranian nuclear weapon is, after all, the central issue of U.S.-Iran enmity. Acknowledging that is an important first step to resolving it -- and to finding the peace that Rouhani seems to so badly want."," One and a half months into his tenure, and just one week before he  addresses the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sat down with NBC News on Wednesday. It was his first interview with the Western media since taking office, and it appears to be the latest move in his not-so-subtle campaign signaling to the United States that he's interested in ending decades of enmity. A snip of the interview is above; you can read NBC's write-up here. Here are three important take-aways from the parts of the interview that NBC has made available. The first two are great, positive signs that Rouhani and President Obama could find their way to a peace deal. The third is a bit more complicated. 1. He's got the supreme leader's okay to cut a nuclear deal. As Rouhani-skeptics often point out, the president is not the final authority in Iranian politics. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is ultimately in charge, especially on matters of national security and foreign policy. The best case for skepticism about Rouhani's peace overtures is that he's just freelancing and will inevitably be undercut by Khamenei. That's still possible, but Rouhani told NBC News that Khamenei gave him full authority to cut a deal with the West over Iran's nuclear program -- the single biggest sticking point of any negotiations. If true, then for Khamenei to hand Rouhani that power would be a remarkably positive step just in itself, a sign of institutional weight shifting toward compromise and diplomacy. That Rouhani could actually see it through is even better. As The Washington Post's Jason Rezaian reported earlier this week, Khamenei has issued several statements publicly embracing diplomacy over militancy -- a remarkable shift given his years of hard-line anti-Western rhetoric and action. 2. He's pen pals with Obama. A few days ago, Obama revealed that he had written to Rouhani after his election. Obama had also tried this with Khamenei a few years earlier but was rebuffed. Right about the same time as Rouhani's interview today, the White House revealed the gist of the president's letter: that the United States was ready to make a peace deal over the nuclear program and that it would tolerate a peaceful nuclear program. Rouhani didn't say much when asked about the letter, but his tone was positive and he did reveal that he wrote back to Obama. ""The tone of [Obama's] letter was positive and constructive,"" he said, calling their exchanges ""subtle and tiny steps for a very important future."" That's an analytically sound view of the letters, and one that implies both that action speaks louder than words and that Rouhani hopes for a lot more. More good news. 3. He denied that Iran will ever build a nuclear weapon. This is the one point that's gotten a lot of positive attention but about which I'm a touch less sanguine. Rouhani said that Iran will ""never under any circumstances develop a nuclear weapon."" As Matt Duss of the Center for American Progress Progress points out on Twitter, ""Iran regime has always denied it sought nuclear weapons, so Rohani's comments don't represent a concession. Still hugely positive, though."" This is, in other words, status quo. It also strains credulity a bit. Western intelligence agencies tend to believe that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon. But there are lots of signs that it is at least trying to give itself that option -- vast, clandestine nuclear-enrichment operations buried deep underground don't inspire the deepest confidences.

But ask them what the number 655 has to do with it, and you'd be met with silence. Try the same thing in an Iranian classroom, asking about the United States, and you'd probably hear some of the same words. Mention the number 655, though, it's a safe bet that at least a few of the students would immediately know what you were talking about. The number, 655, is a flight number: Iran Air 655. If you've never heard of it, you're far from alone. But you should know the story if you want to better understand why the United States and Iran so badly distrust one another and why it will be so difficult to strike a nuclear deal, as they're attempting to do at a summit in Switzerland this week. The story of Iran Air 655 begins, like so much of the U.S.-Iran struggle, with the 1979 Islamic revolution. When Iraq invaded Iran the following year, the United States supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein against the two countries' mutual Iranian enemy. The war dragged on for eight awful years, claiming perhaps a million lives. Toward the end of the war, on July 3, 1988, a U.S. Navy ship called the Vincennes was exchanging fire with small Iranian ships in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. Navy kept ships there, and still does, to protect oil trade routes. As the American and Iranian ships skirmished, Iran Air Flight 655 took off from nearby Bandar Abbas International Airport, bound for Dubai. The airport was used by both civilian and military aircraft. The Vincennes mistook the lumbering Airbus A300 civilian airliner for a much smaller and faster F-14 fighter jet, perhaps in the heat of battle or perhaps because the flight allegedly did not identify itself. It fired two surface-to-air missiles, killing all 290 passengers and crew members on board. The horrible incident brought Tehran closer to ending the war, but its effects have lingered much longer than that. ""The shoot-down of Iran Air flight 655 was an accident, but that is not how it was seen in Tehran,"" former CIA analyst and current Brookings scholar Kenneth Pollack wrote in his 2004 history of U.S.-Iran enmity, ""The Persian Puzzle."" ""The Iranian government assumed that the attack had been purposeful. ... Tehran convinced itself that Washington was trying to signal that the United States had decided to openly enter the war on Iraq's side."" That belief, along with Iraq's increased use of chemical weapons against Iran, led Tehran to accept a United Nations cease-fire two months later. But it also helped cement a view in Iran, still common among hard-liners in the government, that the United States is absolutely committed to the destruction of the Islamic Republic and will stop at almost nothing to accomplish this. It is, as Time's Michael Crowley points out in an important piece, one of several reasons that Iran has a hard time believing it can trust the United States to ever stop short of its complete destruction. This is not just an issue of historical grievance: It matters in immediate geopolitical terms to the efforts by President Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to find their way to a nuclear deal and perhaps a first step toward detente. For any deal to work, both countries will have to trust that the other is sincere about its willingness to follow through on its promises. For the United States, that means trusting that Iran is really willing to give up any nuclear weapons ambitions and ramp down the program as promised (Washington has real, legitimate grounds to worry about this; Iran has its own history of misdeeds). For Iran, it means trusting that the United States will actually accept the Islamic Republic and coexist peacefully with it. The eight-year war with Iraq, which is widely seen in Iran as a war against not just Hussein but his Western backers, and the downing of Iran Air Flight 655 that came near its conclusion, have convinced many in Iran that the United States simply cannot be trusted to let Iran be. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Rouhani's boss, often appears to share this deep distrust. Khamenei and other hard-liners could scuttle any deal; a similar drama will likely play out in Washington. If Iran believes that the United States is so committed to its destruction that it would willingly shoot down a plane full of Iranian civilians, then Tehran has every incentive to assume we're lying in negotiations. It also has strong incentives to try to build a nuclear weapon, or at least get close enough to deter the American invasion that it feared was coming in 1988 and perhaps again in 2002 with President George W. Bush's ""axis of evil"" speech. Americans might not know about Flight 655.

0,"In 1988, the U.S. Navy ship Vincennes shot down an Iranian civilian flight, Iran Air 655, killing all 290 passengers and crew on board. The incident has hung over U.S.-Iranian relations for 25 years and remains extremely sensitive. Toby Craig Jones, an associate professor of history at Rutgers University who focuses on U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, argues that the incident is a symbol and product of the U.S. strategy in the Gulf, where militarization and energy policies can often blur. What follows is from part of a research project by Jones on oil and U.S. foreign policy. Seven minutes after takeoff on July 3, 1988, Iran Air Flight 655 plunged into the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 people on board. The flight was to be a routine “milk run,” a regularly scheduled transit ferrying business people and families from Bandar Abbas in Iran to Dubai. Instead, on a clear mid summer morning, the plane was torn from the sky, brought down by two American anti-aircraft missiles. The USS Vincennes, a high-tech missile cruiser that had been dispatched to the Gulf only weeks before, delivered the fatal blow. The first missile cut the plane in two and severed its left wing. The second shredded it and passengers with searing shrapnel. (See Lee Allen Zatarain's The Tanker War, page 326.) Those not killed immediately plunged over 14,000 feet, where they died on impact. A little over six weeks after the attack, the U.S. Department of Defense released a 150-page incident report that remarked [that] the downing of Flight 655 was “a tragic and regrettable accident,” the unfortunate outcome of a complicated “combat environment.” American military and political leaders argued it was a series of inadvertent mistakes, “the fog of war,” and especially Iranian aggression that led to catastrophe. The Vincennes, captained by William C. Rogers and managed by an inexperienced crew, was outfitted with a sophisticated new computerized command and control system known as Aegis that was untested in battle. At the time of the attack, Rogers had ordered the Vincennes and his ship’s helicopter to pursue and fire on several Iranian gunboats, which had reportedly been harassing merchant shipping moments earlier. Flight 655 departed from Bandar Abbas on a flight-path that would have taken it directly over the battle being waged below. While gunning at Iranian speedboats on the surface waters of the Gulf, the crew of the Vincennes tracked Flight 655 above. Almost immediately, they wrongly identified it as an F-14 fighter. Their confusion was partly because the passenger jet had taken off from a dual-use military and civilian airfield. In the midst of battle, they assumed Iran had scrambled a single fighter jet in defense of the small naval craft. Compounding the original error, they made even more crucial mistakes. Most importantly, the crew wrongly determined that the flight was descending toward the ship, as if to launch a bombing run, when in fact it was climbing. It was a perplexing mistake. With data from the ship’s computer clearly showing Flight 655 as gaining altitude, it remains a mystery why the ships’ technicians claimed otherwise. Investigators determined the misreading of the ship’s data and the “tragic” decision to fire had been the product of combat stress brought on by Iranian aggression. Those later looking to deflect American responsibility honed in on Iran’s alleged bad behavior. In hearings held before the U.S. Senate in September Admiral Robert Kelly, from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, argued that Iran “must share some responsibility for this tragedy,” a sentiment that drew broad support from those present as well as from the American public. In its initial report, the Pentagon withheld key details of the incident, particularly the chain of events that led to it. Newsweek magazine later alleged that the military, protecting itself, engaged in a fraudulent cover-up. They wrote that while the Iranian gunboats may have been harassing merchant shipping, they had then disengaged and were in full retreat in the face of superior American firepower. After the gunboats began their initial withdrawal, the American commander in Bahrain ordered U.S. forces to break off their pursuit. Captain Rogers, according to Newsweek's story, ignored the order. He also ignored the military’s standing rules of engagement that limited the American use of deadly force to defensive measures. It was the Vincennes, not the Iranian gunboats that provoked the clash between them. Rogers had the Vincennes pursue the gunboats into Iranian sovereign waters, from which it launched the two missiles that felled Flight 655. David Carlson, who commanded the cruiser USS Sides, and was in supporting role of and less than 20 nautical miles from Vincennes when it launched its attack, denied that the Iranians had been especially aggressive. Carlson later remarked that there “was no coordinated attack involving” the Iranian gunboats. He even challenged the prevailing assumption that the Iranian posture in the Gulf was threatening more generally. He reflected, “my experience was that the conduct of the Iranian military forces in the month preceding the incident was pointedly non-threatening.” While Carlson conceded that he thought the flight might have been an F-14 at the time, several of his crew rightly identified it as a civilian aircraft. Either way, Carlson never believed Flight 655 posed a risk and watched in horror as the Vincennes launched its missiles. In disputing more apologetic accounts that sought to justify the Vincennes’s choices, the Sides’ commander offered a much less flattering analysis. “Having watched the performance of the Vincennes for a month before the incident,” he recalled that his “impression was clearly that an atmosphere of restraint was not her strong suit.” Revealing that his colleagues had taken to calling the Vincennes “Robo Cruiser” well before July 3, Carlson suggested that his “guess was that the crew of the Vincennes felt a need to prove the viability of Aegis [the ship’s new computerized system] ... and that they hankered for an opportunity to show their stuff.” Carlson’s was a damning account, although perhaps it was one that could be dismissed as the product of competing egos among rival commanders in the Gulf. Whatever happened on the bridge of the Vincennes that led Rogers to make a terrible choice, the significance of Flight 655’s fate had as much to do with the broader political and political economic forces at work in the region and in the moment that made the tragedy possible in the first place. The downing of Flight 655 marked a critical moment in the late 20th century histories of the Gulf and to the shifting relationship between energy, the global political economy, and modern war. The attack ushered in the beginning of the end of what had been a long and bloody war between Iran and Iraq. Convinced that the U.S., which had ramped up its military presence in the region in 1986, was committed to their defeat, and with Iraq having fully embraced the use of chemical weapons, Iranian leaders agreed to a United Nations-backed ceasefire in late July, just three weeks after the incident. While U.S. officials sought to deflect criticism and minimize their responsibility, the reality was that the tragedy helped serve American interests. The United States threw its support behind the Ba’ath regime in Baghdad and over the course of the 1980s its levels of support for the Iraq war machine, including the direct projection of American military might, deepened considerably. By the summer of 1988, the U.S. Navy was patrolling the Gulf, shepherding oil tankers as they passed through the Strait of Hormuz, had established an elaborate anti-Iranian surveillance and policing network, and was trading shots with the Iranian Navy. Little reported at the time, just months before the July attack the U.S. staged its largest Naval confrontation since World War II against Iran. American antagonisms and work to thwart Iranian mobility in the Gulf have remained in place ever since. After the war was over, and after the United States turned on its former Iraqi partners, the American commitment to maintaining a large military in the Middle East further intensified. So too would the commitment to its use of force and to what should be understood as the genesis of one long American war in the Middle East. The attack on Flight 655 also reflected something more complex and uncertain about the character of the broader conflict that was settling in. While the U.S. and its allies would go on to wage conventional campaigns in Kuwait in 1991 and again in Iraq in 2003, the moments in between and after can better be understand as a kind of permanent quasi-war – not war, but also not its absence. The condition of almost war, in which the military was engaged in hostilities that aimed to “contain” Iran, was already in place in the late 1980s. Indeed, the lack of certainty around the United States’ strategic objectives, and ambiguity about the US Navy’s mission in 1988 in particular, are crucial to understanding what was going on when the Vincennes shot down Flight 655. Much of the hand-wringing inside the United States government around that incident was framed around that claim that “war begets accidents.” Commander Carlson’s remarks in rebuttal to such thinking – “that is axiomatic, but we were not at war"" – reflected both the uncertainty of the moment and also drew attention to the exceptionally high human stakes of strategic uncertainty. In addition to uncertainties about the U.S. mission and how it should behave were broader questions about how it arrived at precisely that point and how we should think about the character of the region’s emerging political order, one in which violence steadily intensified and in which war was not exceptional, but a permanent structural feature of the order of things. The downing of Flight 655 was rooted in a shifting politics around energy, and, in the making of a regional order in the 1980s in which “energy” and “war” became increasingly interdependent. The argument here is that the expansion of both the American presence and its use of violence resulted in the fundamental transformation of the relationship between energy and war, one in which the distinction between them was erased. The United States had intensified its military presence in the mid-1980s, ostensibly to protect the flow of oil from the Northern Gulf, where the Iran-Iraq war had intensified, to global markets. A year before the downing of Flight 655, Richard W. Murphy, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs and the Reagan administration’s most visible spokesperson for its military policy in the Gulf, remarked in prepared testimony to Congress that “ready access to Gulf oil is critical to the economic well-being of the West.” He continued that the Middle East “is strategically important to the United States. We would suffer a major strategic defeat should a power hostile to the United States sharply increase its power and influence in the region... The administration like its predecessors, is committed to maintaining the free flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz and supporting the individual and collective self-defense of the Arab Gulf states.” Ensuring the flow of oil, or stated otherwise, providing security for oil, was and remains a central tenant of the American case for its role in the Gulf. But the now-common idea of ""energy security"" is an articulation that obscures more than it reveals. The neat division of energy and security into related but still separate categories misses the more important ways in which the two have become inextricably connected, physically and technologically built into one another. In creating a new techno-political order around energy and war starting in the mid-1980s, the United States and its allies engaged in a struggle to make and unmake space and movement in the Gulf, to create both a system of surveillance and control that privileged themselves as well as in a struggle to refashion the political geography of the region. The fluidity of the Gulf, the fact that both the seascape and the objects moving on it were always in motion, gave rise to a corresponding fluidity in the techno-political and geopolitical order in the region. The system was leaky and uncertain and mobility both on the sea and in the air was precarious. The result was the system was, according to those who sought to control, always in crisis and, thus, always at war. It has been ever since.","In 1988, the U.S. Navy ship Vincennes shot down an Iranian civilian flight, Iran Air 655, killing all 290 passengers and crew on board.

Either way, Carlson never believed Flight 655 posed a risk and watched in horror as the Vincennes launched its missiles. In disputing more apologetic accounts that sought to justify the Vincennes’s choices, the Sides’ commander offered a much less flattering analysis. “Having watched the performance of the Vincennes for a month before the incident,” he recalled that his “impression was clearly that an atmosphere of restraint was not her strong suit.” Revealing that his colleagues had taken to calling the Vincennes “Robo Cruiser” well before July 3, Carlson suggested that his “guess was that the crew of the Vincennes felt a need to prove the viability of Aegis [the ship’s new computerized system] ... and that they hankered for an opportunity to show their stuff.” Carlson’s was a damning account, although perhaps it was one that could be dismissed as the product of competing egos among rival commanders in the Gulf. Whatever happened on the bridge of the Vincennes that led Rogers to make a terrible choice, the significance of Flight 655’s fate had as much to do with the broader political and political economic forces at work in the region and in the moment that made the tragedy possible in the first place. The downing of Flight 655 marked a critical moment in the late 20th century histories of the Gulf and to the shifting relationship between energy, the global political economy, and modern war. The attack ushered in the beginning of the end of what had been a long and bloody war between Iran and Iraq. Convinced that the U.S., which had ramped up its military presence in the region in 1986, was committed to their defeat, and with Iraq having fully embraced the use of chemical weapons, Iranian leaders agreed to a United Nations-backed ceasefire in late July, just three weeks after the incident. While U.S. officials sought to deflect criticism and minimize their responsibility, the reality was that the tragedy helped serve American interests. The United States threw its support behind the Ba’ath regime in Baghdad and over the course of the 1980s its levels of support for the Iraq war machine, including the direct projection of American military might, deepened considerably. By the summer of 1988, the U.S. Navy was patrolling the Gulf, shepherding oil tankers as they passed through the Strait of Hormuz, had established an elaborate anti-Iranian surveillance and policing network, and was trading shots with the Iranian Navy. Little reported at the time, just months before the July attack the U.S. staged its largest Naval confrontation since World War II against Iran. American antagonisms and work to thwart Iranian mobility in the Gulf have remained in place ever since. After the war was over, and after the United States turned on its former Iraqi partners, the American commitment to maintaining a large military in the Middle East further intensified. So too would the commitment to its use of force and to what should be understood as the genesis of one long American war in the Middle East. The attack on Flight 655 also reflected something more complex and uncertain about the character of the broader conflict that was settling in. While the U.S. and its allies would go on to wage conventional campaigns in Kuwait in 1991 and again in Iraq in 2003, the moments in between and after can better be understand as a kind of permanent quasi-war – not war, but also not its absence. The condition of almost war, in which the military was engaged in hostilities that aimed to “contain” Iran, was already in place in the late 1980s. Indeed, the lack of certainty around the United States’ strategic objectives, and ambiguity about the US Navy’s mission in 1988 in particular, are crucial to understanding what was going on when the Vincennes shot down Flight 655. Much of the hand-wringing inside the United States government around that incident was framed around that claim that “war begets accidents.” Commander Carlson’s remarks in rebuttal to such thinking – “that is axiomatic, but we were not at war"" – reflected both the uncertainty of the moment and also drew attention to the exceptionally high human stakes of strategic uncertainty. In addition to uncertainties about the U.S. mission and how it should behave were broader questions about how it arrived at precisely that point and how we should think about the character of the region’s emerging political order, one in which violence steadily intensified and in which war was not exceptional, but a permanent structural feature of the order of things. The downing of Flight 655 was rooted in a shifting politics around energy, and, in the making of a regional order in the 1980s in which “energy” and “war” became increasingly interdependent. The argument here is that the expansion of both the American presence and its use of violence resulted in the fundamental transformation of the relationship between energy and war, one in which the distinction between them was erased. The United States had intensified its military presence in the mid-1980s, ostensibly to protect the flow of oil from the Northern Gulf, where the Iran-Iraq war had intensified, to global markets. A year before the downing of Flight 655, Richard W. Murphy, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs and the Reagan administration’s most visible spokesperson for its military policy in the Gulf, remarked in prepared testimony to Congress that “ready access to Gulf oil is critical to the economic well-being of the West.” He continued that the Middle East “is strategically important to the United States. We would suffer a major strategic defeat should a power hostile to the United States sharply increase its power and influence in the region... The administration like its predecessors, is committed to maintaining the free flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz and supporting the individual and collective self-defense of the Arab Gulf states.” Ensuring the flow of oil, or stated otherwise, providing security for oil, was and remains a central tenant of the American case for its role in the Gulf. But the now-common idea of ""energy security"" is an articulation that obscures more than it reveals. The neat division of energy and security into related but still separate categories misses the more important ways in which the two have become inextricably connected, physically and technologically built into one another. In creating a new techno-political order around energy and war starting in the mid-1980s, the United States and its allies engaged in a struggle to make and unmake space and movement in the Gulf, to create both a system of surveillance and control that privileged themselves as well as in a struggle to refashion the political geography of the region. The fluidity of the Gulf, the fact that both the seascape and the objects moving on it were always in motion, gave rise to a corresponding fluidity in the techno-political and geopolitical order in the region. The system was leaky and uncertain and mobility both on the sea and in the air was precarious. The result was the system was, according to those who sought to control, always in crisis and, thus, always at war. It has been ever since."

0,"When top Philadelphia Inquirer editor Bill Marimow was fired on Oct. 7, he resisted the action. Early reports on the drama indicated that the veteran journalist, who had a long history at the paper, felt the move was somehow unjustified and afoul of company policies. Today he got vindication. Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge Patricia McInerney this afternoon issued a five-page ruling putting Marimow back in his office. The decision that ousted Marimow, reasoned McInerney, violated the swollen operating agreement under which the various part-owners of the Inquirer and two other Philadelphia media properties — the Philadelphia Daily News and Philly.com — do their business. That document leaves a “management committee” in charge of making critical decisions about the company. It consists of two part-owners: George E. Norcross III, a southern New Jersey political force and a prominent insurance executive, and wealthy entrepreneur Lewis Katz, a former owner of the New Jersey Nets. From the beginning of the Marimow spat, Katz argued that the editor’s dismissal was improperly ordered without his say-so. The company’s operations agreement states that the management committee has the “right, power, and authority to make decisions with respect to all business and operational matters in the ordinary course of business and will oversee and advise the senior management of the company regarding the performance and execution of the business and strategic plans.” If that’s not ambiguous enough, there’s more confusing language that follows: “The authority of the Management Committee shall be confined to the business and operational aspects of the Company and the members of the Management Committee shall have no authority with respect to editorial or journalistic policies and decisions of the Company and will not attempt to control or influence such policies and decisions.” Simple question: Does that mean the management committee has the authority to hire and fire the editor? That’s essentially what the two sides were fighting about in this case. The firing of Marimow was carried out by Inquirer Publisher Robert Hall, who is seen as close to Norcross. Throughout this conflict, Norcross and his allies in the ownership group held that Hall had full authority to take action against Marimow. Katz and allied part-owner H.F. “Gerry” Lenfest, a prominent Philadelphia philanthropist, countered that choosing editorial leadership was properly a matter for the management committee. Since Katz wasn’t consulted on Marimow’s ouster, they argued in court, his rights under the operating agreement were violated. McInerney agreed. Crucial in returning Marimow to his perch was the testimony of Greg Osberg, who served as publisher when Marimow acceded to his job in the spring of 2012. The former publisher testified that he hadn’t hired Marimow and thus couldn’t fire him either. And it was the management committee, noted the judge in her ruling, that hired Marimow in the first place. Marimow was back in the Inquirer newsroom this afternoon. “There were cheers and hugs and a lot of warmth,” said Marimow, who reported that his computer passwords and e-mail were up and running. “It feels great to be in a newsroom instead of a courtroom.” Marimow expressed his gratitude to Katz and Lenfest for undertaking the court battle, as well as the legal team that pushed for his return. McInerney’s ruling, he said, gives Katz and Lenfest “the right to participate in the management and operation of a company in which they’re owners.” The Marimow-Katz-Lenfest alliance has held that Norcross, a fiery and powerful personality with a grand business and politics portfolio in southern New Jersey, had played a big-footed role in the management of the three news properties since the group took over in the spring of 2012. Norcross, in turn, has argued that it’s Katz who’s guilty of interfering in the operation of the Inquirer — by allying himself with Marimow and his companion, city editor Nancy Phillips. And far from ending such infighting, McInerney’s decision essentially reinstates it, along with Marimow. Indeed, the court has returned the Inquirer to the status quo of … Oct. 6. In the weeks leading up to the Marimow dismissal, the owners bickered over the reduction of the Inquirer’s opinion offerings, among other matters. When asked if he was prepared to dive into such an abyss, Marimow cited the position already announced by Katz: “It’s really time now to come up with the best way to bring the partnership together or break it apart.” McInerney surely wouldn’t dispute that assessment. In her opinion, she divulged her view on the possibility of harmonious management relations at the three Philadelphia properties: “The court further recognizes that the granting of said petition solely resolves the discrete and narrow issue that is pending before the court and does not resolve nor necessarily advance the likelihood of resolution of any other issues in the operation of the Inquirer.” When asked if he’d exercise more caution in discussing the news operation with his unruly ownership, Marimow responded that he has no concerns about addressing “the company and journalistic philosophy” with the partners. The editorial non-interference pledge binding on the owners, said Marimow, means that “you can’t tell the editor to endorse President Obama. … To me, that pledge is a promise not to interfere with content.” In a sure sign that the troubles aren’t done, the Norcross squad is already signaling it’ll appeal the ruling on an “expedited basis”: The decision to return Marimow to the Inquirer as a lame duck editor – his contract ends April 30th – will have the effect of risking chaos in the company, restoring an editor who consistently resisted needed changes to the paper and who is in open conflict with the Publisher, Bob Hall, who the court decreed will remain in his position. The ruling ensures that every newsroom decision will require the joint agreement of the Managing Members, subjecting the company to paralysis. More from Norcross & Co.: Minority owner Lewis Katz, who brought the lawsuit, testified under oath that he believed it appropriate for an owner to be able to influence the operations of the newsroom, including the hiring and firing of journalists, with no set standards for how far or how often they can reach in to influence coverage. That would render the non-interference pledge meaningless because the power to fire is the power to influence coverage. Given that Nancy Phillips, Katz’ girlfriend, testified under oath that she created an “official version” of how Marimow was hired, it is difficult to understand how they can continue to assert they are protecting the ‘integrity’ of journalism. We believe today’s decision is wrong and will harm the journalistic independence and operations of the newsroom. In newspapers across the country, it is the Publisher who has the right to make personnel decisions, including the hiring and firing of the editor as Publisher Bob Hall did when he removed Bill Marimow as editor of the Inquirer. The court affirmed that Hall was the Publisher and his authority to remove Marimow should have likewise been affirmed.”","When top Philadelphia Inquirer editor Bill Marimow was fired on Oct. 7, he resisted the action.

0,"TEHRAN -- Iran’s parliament on Tuesday took a step closer to criminalizing permanent forms of contraception, in a move intended to turn around a decreasing population rate. The framework of legislation that would ban abortions, vasectomies, tubectomies, and any form of sterilization passed. Convicted offenders would face lengthy prison terms. Also included in the bill was a prohibition on any advertisement that promotes decreases in the birth rate. Lawmakers have not yet clarified who will be punished -- health care providers or patients who choose to undertake these procedures. The move is a response to calls from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to increase the country’s population, which rapidly grew in the years following the 1979 revolution. In the late 1980s, contraception and other forms of birth control became widely available and the birth rate slowed dramatically. But some officials now believe such measures were a mistake. “The Plan for Increasing the Rate of Childbirth and Decreasing the Decline in Population” was introduced by Ali Motahhari, an influential conservative whose late father is considered one of the figures central in forming the Islamic republic’s core ideology. Lawmakers voted 106 to 72 in favor the bill, with 28 abstaining. Critics warned that outlawing such procedures would lead to new problems and do little to promote population growth. “Passing this bill will definitely lead to illegal procedures in dark corridors and unregulated offices. We have take cultural action and I’m pleading with the speaker of parliament that we cannot force people to have children with prison terms and lashes,” lawmaker Mohammad Davatgari said.","TEHRAN -- Iran’s parliament on Tuesday took a step closer to criminalizing permanent forms of contraception, in a move intended to turn around a decreasing population rate.

Or an institution that sold billions of dollars worth of bonds full of toxic loans couldn't sell securities for six months. And dozens of employees, including senior managers,  involved in either case were fired. This is the sort punishment that New York's Department of Financial Services chief Benjamin Lawsky doled out to France's BNP Paribas on Monday for processing transactions in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan. The state regulator banned the bank from converting foreign currency into U.S. dollars through its New York office for a year and forced it to can 13 employees, including the chief operating officer. The Justice Department also exacted a guilty plea from the bank and helped orchestrate a $8.9 billion settlement with several U.S. agencies. The fine and the criminal charges are nothing to sneeze at, but the management shake out and dollar-clearing suspension arguably accomplished what some say is a rare feat in financial justice: a punishment proportional to the crime. Handling money for Iran, Cuba and Sudan BNP stands guilty of illegally processing about $190 billion, according to Lawsky's estimates, for clients in Iran, Cuba and Sudan for nearly a decade. The bank went to such elaborate lengths to throw U.S. regulators off that it routed money through a network of regional banks in the Middle East, Europe and Africa with their own clearing codes. Given the nature of the crime, New York's top financial regulator choose to temporarily suspend BNP's ability to process dollar payments--a critical step in handling client transactions from paying suppliers to managing payroll. It is a common-sense approach to punishment, especially for firms who can recover from multibillion-dollar fines with a few quarters' profits, advocates say. Shareholders are never pleased to see billions of dollars go to pay fines, but couple that payout with revenue lost from a profitable line of business and they might force a management change. Kicking banks out of certain markets But if all regulators barred banks from the activities at the heart of their misdeeds, what kind impact would that have on the industry, the markets or the economy? Prudential regulators--the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.--have the authority to ban executives and force banks to ""cease and desist"" any activity they believe threaten the ""safety and soundness"" of the institution. And they have used those powers to prevent institutions from keeping embezzling bankers on the board, opening branches or growing certain lines of business. Just a few weeks ago, the FDIC banned Bancorp Bank, known for backing prepaid debit cards, from issuing any general-purpose prepaid cards until it could clean up its lax money laundering controls. The OCC, nearly a decade ago, even handed down an order against Arab Bank, one of the largest financial players in the Middle East, similar to the BNP order--banning the bank from money transfers and from taking new deposits. But Arab Bank isn't exactly Bank of America or Wells Fargo, whose alleged misdeeds in the mortgage market--peddling shoddy home loans to unqualified consumers or steering minorities into unsustainable mortgages--affected millions of Americans. Could this happen a U.S. bank? When the Fed took action in 2011 against Wells Fargo for steering people with good credit--prime borrowers--into costly subprime mortgages, the order mandated a slew of changes to correct the problem. But none of the individuals involved were fired or banned from banking, nor did the company have to stop making home loans for any period of time. The same can be said of the dozens of other mortgage-related regulatory orders involving big banks. Considering that Wells Fargo controls more than a third of the mortgage market--from making home loans to servicing them--a six-month suspension from the business might hurt consumers as much as the bank. Or it could go a long way in helping the bank's competitors. ""If regulators push too hard on the suspension side, you end up anointing winners and losers in a particularly industry,"" said Jim Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University. ""On the other hand, if the business you fine sees it as a random tax you have to pay from time to time, then the fines lose their deterrent affect."" Angel said suspensions should be an option in a ""diversified portfolio of tools"" to punish bad behavior, but one that is used carefully and sparingly. ""If you ban a bank from a certain line of business, it does have effect of hitting them in the pocketbook. But it is also going to hurt them in the long run and perhaps force them to withdraw altogether,"" he said. Customers, he added, will likely migrate to competitors and employees could be laid off during the suspension. ""Regulators really need to ask do we really want to push them out of the industry because that is the real risk."" Would it even be enough without charges? Some argue that suspensions and firings, while welcomed punishments, are far from enough to deter white collar crime. Revenue and clients lost during a suspension can be recouped, while executives pushed out of a company tend to leave with a fat compensation package. ""What the controlling officers care about is not being prosecuted, having proceeds clawed back and not having their reputation besmirched,"" said William K. Black, a former bank regulator who teaches economics and law at the University of Missouri. He added: ""They will trade of billions of dollars in fines to the corporation to ensure that their objectives are met. And a credulous public will be misled by the size to think that something really serious in deterrence may be going on."" Black applauds Lawsky's effort to ratchet up punishment and calls on other regulators to do the same, but questions why prosecutors decided not to bring charges against individuals. ""If you don't prosecute any individual, even the most culpable at the top, in a case like this...then what are you going to prosecute? This is an entity that they say led to the funding of a genocidal regime in Sudan. What would it take to prosecute?""","Imagine if a bank that wrongfully foreclosed on hundreds of homeowners couldn't issue mortgages for a year.

It is a common-sense approach to punishment, especially for firms who can recover from multibillion-dollar fines with a few quarters' profits, advocates say. Shareholders are never pleased to see billions of dollars go to pay fines, but couple that payout with revenue lost from a profitable line of business and they might force a management change. Kicking banks out of certain markets But if all regulators barred banks from the activities at the heart of their misdeeds, what kind impact would that have on the industry, the markets or the economy? Prudential regulators--the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.--have the authority to ban executives and force banks to ""cease and desist"" any activity they believe threaten the ""safety and soundness"" of the institution. And they have used those powers to prevent institutions from keeping embezzling bankers on the board, opening branches or growing certain lines of business. Just a few weeks ago, the FDIC banned Bancorp Bank, known for backing prepaid debit cards, from issuing any general-purpose prepaid cards until it could clean up its lax money laundering controls. The OCC, nearly a decade ago, even handed down an order against Arab Bank, one of the largest financial players in the Middle East, similar to the BNP order--banning the bank from money transfers and from taking new deposits. But Arab Bank isn't exactly Bank of America or Wells Fargo, whose alleged misdeeds in the mortgage market--peddling shoddy home loans to unqualified consumers or steering minorities into unsustainable mortgages--affected millions of Americans. Could this happen a U.S. bank? When the Fed took action in 2011 against Wells Fargo for steering people with good credit--prime borrowers--into costly subprime mortgages, the order mandated a slew of changes to correct the problem. But none of the individuals involved were fired or banned from banking, nor did the company have to stop making home loans for any period of time. The same can be said of the dozens of other mortgage-related regulatory orders involving big banks. Considering that Wells Fargo controls more than a third of the mortgage market--from making home loans to servicing them--a six-month suspension from the business might hurt consumers as much as the bank. Or it could go a long way in helping the bank's competitors. ""If regulators push too hard on the suspension side, you end up anointing winners and losers in a particularly industry,"" said Jim Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University. ""On the other hand, if the business you fine sees it as a random tax you have to pay from time to time, then the fines lose their deterrent affect."" Angel said suspensions should be an option in a ""diversified portfolio of tools"" to punish bad behavior, but one that is used carefully and sparingly. ""If you ban a bank from a certain line of business, it does have effect of hitting them in the pocketbook. But it is also going to hurt them in the long run and perhaps force them to withdraw altogether,"" he said. Customers, he added, will likely migrate to competitors and employees could be laid off during the suspension. ""Regulators really need to ask do we really want to push them out of the industry because that is the real risk."" Would it even be enough without charges? Some argue that suspensions and firings, while welcomed punishments, are far from enough to deter white collar crime. Revenue and clients lost during a suspension can be recouped, while executives pushed out of a company tend to leave with a fat compensation package. ""What the controlling officers care about is not being prosecuted, having proceeds clawed back and not having their reputation besmirched,"" said William K. Black, a former bank regulator who teaches economics and law at the University of Missouri. He added: ""They will trade of billions of dollars in fines to the corporation to ensure that their objectives are met. And a credulous public will be misled by the size to think that something really serious in deterrence may be going on."" Black applauds Lawsky's effort to ratchet up punishment and calls on other regulators to do the same, but questions why prosecutors decided not to bring charges against individuals. ""If you don't prosecute any individual, even the most culpable at the top, in a case like this...then what are you going to prosecute? This is an entity that they say led to the funding of a genocidal regime in Sudan. What would it take to prosecute?"""
0,"Last week, Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, his wife Yeganeh Salehi and two photojournalists were arrested in Iran. Officials haven’t explained why a dozen armed men raided Rezaian’s home; they haven’t offered up very much information at all. But I have a good sense of what Rezaian and his colleagues may be going through. The same thing happened to me. I was Newsweek’s Iran correspondent from 1998 until 2009. During that time, I was also making documentary films and television reports. As a journalist working for a foreign news agency, I was always under government supervision. I would get invited to “drink tea” in one of Tehran’s posh hotels (the ones that used to be an Intercontinental or Hilton before the 1979 revolution, and are now called Tulip and Independence). After a short mandatory chitchat about the health of my family and the weather, I’d be subjected to hours of interrogations by members of the Ministry of Intelligence. They’d offer me tea (Iranian spooks love to keep a healthy bladder), then go through everything I’d written or filmed in the prior months. They wanted me to know whatever I was doing, I was being watched. If I did something wrong, bad things could happen to me. They revoked my press card a few times and asked me to continue reporting in neighboring Iraq, where I worked with more freedom than Iran. I wrote about this for the British magazine New Statesman in 2007. I was interrogated for that piece a few days later. The Ministry of Intelligence agents were paranoid and distrustful, but they had specific complaints about my work and some knowledge of the international media. Unfortunately, they aren’t the only intelligence arm in Iran. Each agency has its own agents and agenda, and in many cases conflicting agendas. Most are comprised of the Intelligence Ministry’s rejects, people who love to interrogate and torture but don’t know much about espionage. I later found out that while the ministry was interrogating me, I was being watched by the Revolutionary Guard, a branch of Iran’s military controlled by the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The guard’s intelligence-gathering unit is one of the most fearsome organizations in Iran, not because of its proficiency but because of its vicious methods of physical and psychological torture, as well as its paranoia and obsession with sex. Maziar Bahari. Image courtesy of the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office According to an old Persian fable, a rabbit was once running in haste. His friends asked him why he was running so fast. He said, “There are people up the road who will cut off your testicles if they find that you have three!” The friends commented: “But you only have two. So what’s the rush?” The rabbit replied, before dashing away, “But first they cut them and then they count!” This summarizes the Revolutionary Guards’ approach to intelligence gathering. They throw charges at you and they try to find evidence for them. That’s what happened to me. I had been traveling for work and was between apartments, so I was staying with my mother. At 7 o’clock one morning, the guards forced their way into her apartment. I was still fast asleep. They woke me up and blindfolded me and took me to Evin prison. They didn’t tell me where we were going; they just showed me a photocopy of my arrest warrant. Later, I learned they’d showed the same thing to 500 to 600 other people. At Evin, I was at their mercy. I was accused of being a spy for different agencies — the CIA, Mossad, MI6 and Newsweek. They interrogated me, then put me into solitary confinement. On the walls, other prisoners had scribbled messages: “My God, have mercy on me;” “My God, I repent;” and “Please help me, God.” Over the next few days, my life took on a routine of sorts — I’d go to the interrogation room, where I’d be tortured, kicked, punched and slapped, then sent back to solitary confinement. Then back to the interrogation room where my torturer would threaten me with execution and harming my family and friends. I lost track of my days and nights; the only way to know what time it was by three calls to prayer. They were also the only times that I could use the toilet. I was locked up for four months. At times, I wondered how I’d survive. I knew they could keep me forever, or kill me, if they wanted to. So many atrocities have happened since the 1979 revolution; so many innocent people have died in Evin Prison.   My family, with the help of Newsweek and The Washington Post Company, fought hard for my release. Dozens of newspapers and magazines published petitions calling for my release. Diplomats negotiated behind the scenes. Very reliable sources later told me that when then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited New York in September 2009, he grew tired of hearing my name in every interview and diplomatic meeting. Eventually the regime gave in. Iran is not North Korea. It deeply cares what people think, and so campaigns against human rights abuses in Iran work. Right now, I imagine Jason is going through a similar period of insecurity and intimidation. He most probably doesn’t know who arrested him or why. I’m sure he’s being accused of something vague, like undermining the security of the nation or propagating lies against “the Holy Islamic Republic of Iran.” Things have changed since I was arrested in 2009. That year, millions of people filled the streets demanding that their presidential votes be recounted. The opposition Green Movement didn’t change everything. But it meant that in 2013, during the next presidential election, officials couldn’t rig the vote in the same way. People’s votes were counted. Hassan Rouhani was elected, even though he’s unpopular with the country’s conservatives. This set off panic within the conservative arm of the government. The Revolutionary Guard thinks of Rouhani and his supporters as the enemy and will do anything to undermine him. Jason’s arrest might be part of that plan. Maybe the Revolutionary Guard wants to interrupt negotiations between Iran and the West, or undermine Rouhani’s government. All we know is that Jason was doing his job as a journalist; that’s why he is in jail. It is very important for us, and Jason, to remember that. When I was in prison, one thing that kept me strong was knowing that I was innocent. I’d been arrested for doing my job and not a crime. I felt good about that.

0,"The American conversation is dominated right now with news from Ferguson, Mo., with many shocked by scenes of social unrest and heavy-handed police crackdowns. Protesters are being tear-gassed and journalists, including The Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery, man-handled and arrested. These are images we’re more used to seeing outside the United States, and, in a day and age where Twitter can so swiftly stitch together news events occurring in far-flung places, the events in the town have led to numerous comparisons to crises elsewhere. Here are some ways that Ferguson, as our colleague put it, has become ""Fergustan."" The arrest of journalists On Wednesday, police arrested two journalists at a McDonald's restaurant in Ferguson. The journalists — Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post and Wesley — were later released without charge. You can read Wesley's account of his arrest (and assault) here. The arrest or detention of journalists covering foreign conflict zones is all too common. There are a number of high-profile examples – such as Simon Ostrovsky, an American journalist covering the Ukraine conflict for Vice News, who was detained by pro-Russian forces earlier this year — but it happens more often than you might think: In the past month, the Committee to Protect Journalists has called for the release of a local journalist arrested in Djibouti, two French journalists arrested in Indonesia, an Ethiopian journalist held without charge, three editors detained in Burma, and many more.     Wesley is not the only journalist working for The Post to be detained recently. Jason Rezaian, our Tehran correspondent, was arrested along with his wife and others on July 21. The State Department has condemned Jason's arrest. The presence of 'outside agitators' Ferguson's police chief, Thomas Jackson, ascribed much of the unrest in recent days to ""outside agitators."" This carries echoes of statements made during the struggles of the civil rights movement, as a Boston College historian pointed out: But it also smacks, immediately, of some of the rhetoric we've heard from overseas autocrats and demagogues denouncing dissent at home. Raising the specter of ""external forces"" or a ""foreign hand"" is the oldest trick in the book for a government or despot keen to obscure the root causes of unrest. Every single president in Egypt in the past half a decade — from the long-entrenched Hosni Mubarak to the Islamist Mohamed Morsi, to Abdel Fatah al-Sissi (the man who ousted Morsi in a coup) — has played this card. So, too, have Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Syria's Bashar al-Assad, Iraq's Nouri al-Maliki and myriad other embattled world leaders. The experience of tear gas Mariam Barghouti, a Palestinian journalist, watched clouds of tear gas encircle Ferguson's protesters and went to Twitter to offer advice and solidarity.     The militarization of the police Many witnessing the scenes in Ferguson have been startled by how well armed the local police forces are. Beyond riot gear, they are equipped with a whole range of weapons and protective clothing that make many look like soldiers deployed overseas to fight in U.S. wars. That's no coincidence: Last year alone, the Defense Department transferred about $400 million worth of surplus combat gear to local law enforcement agencies. The New York Times has a helpful round-up of some of the military technologies now being deployed in Ferguson. When watching the use of such force by the police -- the presence of mine-resistent troop carriers, the images of helmeted snipers taking up their positions atop military vehicles -- it's hard not to dispel comparisons to the militarized security forces of interior ministries in other countries, be they in Egypt or Ukraine. In many parts of the world, the police have a far more antagonistic relationship with the local populace than the army. The no-fly zone On Tuesday, St. Louis County Police Department requested a no-fly zone 3,000 feet over Ferguson. The official reason stated was that it was to ""provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities"" — but it appeared to be a bid to keep news helicopters from the area. Anyone following foreign news, however, will probably be reminded of the confusion after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine last month. That tragedy brought further attention to the areas of the world, often zones of dramatic conflict, where flights are restricted. Although the logic and the scale of Ferguson's no-fly zone are different, it is certainly striking.   The problems for Al Jazeera On Wednesday, journalists from Al Jazeera America found themselves having to run from tear gas as they tried to cover the chaos in Ferguson. ""Rubber bullets were fired on us, and then a canister,"" Ash-har Quraishi, a correspondent for Al Jazeera America, said afterward. ""We had to retreat into the neighborhood."" It's unclear from the video whether the Al Jazeera America journalists were being targeted because of the outlet they worked for. But for anyone who follows news from the Middle East, it'll seem familiar. Al Jazeera is one of the most prominent news sources in the region, but it's fraught with controversies and accusations of bias. In particular, it is often accused of pushing a pro-Muslim Brotherhood line for the Qatari state. This often means that the network is singled out by authorities. In Egypt, for example, three journalists from Al Jazeera were sentenced to prison this year after being accused of collaborating with “terrorists."" Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement calling their sentences ""chilling, draconian."" The use of molotov cocktails Molotov cocktails were a visceral sign of the intensity of Kiev's Euromaidan protests, which began late last year and helped oust Viktor Yanukovych from the Ukrainian presidency in February. The improvised explosives were thrown at Ukraine's Internal Ministry troops — the notorious Berkut — and clearly caused terrible injuries. They were a crude yet effective weapon against the armed and armor-clad security forces, and Ukrainian protesters were far from the only group to use them this year.

I am confident that the Iranian judicial system within the framework of the rules and justice will follow up the cases,” Rouhani told Curry, through an interpreter. Rezaian, 38 and an Iranian and American dual national, was arrested July 22, along with his Iranian wife, journalist Yeganeh Salehi. Another photojournalist and her husband were detained at the same time and have since been released. Officials have offered very few details on the conditions of Rezaian and Salehi. Rouhani’s comments came just days after Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told NPR that Rezaian is “facing interrogation in Iran for what he has done as an Iranian citizen.” The comments from both Rouhani and Zarif emphasize that the judiciary is treating Rezaian as an Iranian national. A Tehran Province Justice Department official confirmed the arrest days after it took place, saying a Washington Post reporter “has been detained for some questions and after technical investigations, the judiciary will provide details on the issue.” Zarif said that Rezaian’s lawyers “know his charge. He knows his charge.” Rezaian’s family, however, has insisted that he hasn’t had access to a lawyer. In a statement, Rezaian’s older brother Ali has said that officials “have conducted a two-month-long investigation from which they have produced no evidence of wrongdoing by either Jason or Yeganeh.” “Neither I nor my mother have been permitted any communication with Jason,” Ali added. “We remain concerned about their health and implore the Iranian authorities to release them in compliance with Iran’s existing laws and constitution.” In the NBC interview Rouhani also said there “is no problem for all the prisoners of Iran,” regardless of whether they work for The Washington Post or another media outlet. “The important thing for us is the laws, rules and regulations, and these regulations will be implemented for all the prisoners. The president is responsible for executing carefully the constitution of our country.” The Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, has said newspaper officials are “profoundly concerned” for the well-being of Rezaian and the others in custody. “Unfortunately, we have received no information about Jason’s whereabouts, his condition, or any allegations that might be made against him,” Baron has said in a statement. Here is the entire exchange between Curry and Rouhani: Curry: Why have Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh, been detained for almost two months? And what is your administration doing to try and resolve their cases? Rouhani: There are a lot of prisoners in the world, and there are a number of Iranians imprisoned by the Americans.  Probably there are people who are in prison in Iran, and of course the people who you named and who you referred to are Iranian nationals, and perhaps there are people detained for security or non-security reasons have been detained within the framework of the Iranian judiciary. They may be investigated, and the judicial process may be completed about them.  Are you surprised that a person in the legal procedures have been investigated because of some accusations? I am confident that the Iranian judicial system within the framework of the rules and justice will follow up the cases. Curry: Can you speak at all to their condition if they are in good condition, or… because their families are very concerned, and one of them is also an American citizen.  Can you speak at all to how soon this might be resolved? Rouhani: What I have been always pursuing as the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran and I always question and I also ask the minister of justice, who is one of my cabinet ninisters, I have always been following up these issues. And of course there is no problem for all the prisoners of Iran. It doesn’t make any difference for us if this prisoner has The Washington Post or this prisoner is working for whichever media outlet. The important thing for us is the laws, rules and regulations, and these regulations will be implemented for all the prisoners.  The president is responsible for executing carefully the constitution of our country.

In his four years at the Post, Ryan has shown himself to be exceptionally versatile, working in all aspects of digital journalism. We expect more of the same in his new role. Ryan brings smarts and an unflappable nature to a myriad of projects he juggles around the room. He has been critical to our efforts in newsroom training, social metadata and web-first reporting. He has a wonderful eye for talent and has helped hire many of the newest members of the Digital Audience team. Most recently, Ryan has been working with Greg Barber on a collaborative project with the New York Times and Mozilla to improve the system for comments and user-provided content, helping to ensure the Post’s needs are met and that the group is up to date on the most relevant recent developments.” As we continuously evaluate new technologies, Ryan has played a central role. A few months ago, Ryan worked with Dee Swann on investigating opportunities for us with new social media tools in video and photography. Their work resulted in us becoming an early partner with Capture, a software that enables us to search photos and videos posted on social media. Ryan’s skills were especially evident in 2012 when he was hurriedly asked to serve as National’s Digital Editor just weeks before the first political convention. He helped successfully guide our digital efforts through the conventions, debates and election night. Ryan was integral to ambitious projects including “Say What” and “The Grid.” He also introduced Instagram to campaign trail reporters, adding great behind-the-scenes angle to our political coverage. Ryan came to us from NPR, where he was on the social media desk. He graduated from Middlebury College in Vermont and seems to be intent on slowly building up a posse of Panthers in the newsroom.","Announcement from Martin Baron, Emilio Garcia-Ruiz, and Kevin Merida: We are excited to announce that Ryan Kellett is our new Audience and Engagement Editor.

0,"Last night, Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron gave the keynote address at the International Center for Journalists 30th anniversary Awards Dinner. In his remarks, Baron discussed the threats journalists have faced over the year, including the beheading of James Foley and Steve Sotloff by the Islamic State, and said “now is a moment to consider how to better protect our people and our mission.” See the video: The full text of his speech is below: Joyce (Barnathan) asked me awhile back if I might … get Jeff Bezos to give a keynote speech. This is what she got. Even as second choice, it’s a great honor to be here. This is a great organization. It pursues an important mission. It maintains high standards. I hope I can meet them tonight. I know this. I can’t do better than the award winners here tonight with their inspiring remarks. All of us admire you. The subject I want to talk about is urgent, in my view, and we’ve already heard a bit about it tonight: Journalists are under threat. Journalism itself is threatened. There is much to be optimistic about. But there is also much to concern us. Governments worldwide are making our work harder through obstruction, surveillance, intimidation. And autocratic governments, along with terrorist and criminal organizations, see killing, kidnapping, maiming, and jailing reporters as all in a day’s work. This deserves our serious attention, especially today when we celebrate journalists of courage and achievement. We need eyewitnesses and honest accounts. The world cannot be covered from the office. It cannot be explained solely by reading reports, studies, and books. We must be out in the world. We need real reporting. Now is a moment to consider how to better protect our people and our mission. What technology do we need? What new training must we provide? How do we build professional support networks that are faster, more nimble, more effective? How do we report safely when so much and so many conspire to defeat us. * * * This past April, after the Pulitzers were announced, an opinion column appeared in Spain’s El Pais. It was titled “The Latin American Pulitzers.” It began: “If there were a Pulitzer for Latin American journalism, also in the category of public service, it would be a daily event.” It continued: “Receiving it would be Cuban bloggers who face an information monopoly that limits their access to the Internet, censors them, intimidates them, and prevents them from dissenting. It would also go to the Honduran journalists, world leader in journalists assassinated per capita . . . “Another Pulitzer would go to the Mexican journalists who risk their lives investigating connections between the economic power of the drug trafficker and political power… “And another for the Argentine journalists, victims of judicial harassment by the government, and street protests by social organizations created and financed by the government…” Credit goes to Hector Schamis, professor at Georgetown University, for that eloquent piece – a reminder that others face challenges far more daunting than our own here in the United States. More and more, around the world, the simple, noble act of free expression is being extinguished. * * * Two images this year cannot, must not, be forgotten. Those are the images of James Foley and Steve Sotloff,  independent journalists executed by the Islamic State. Their fate made horrifyingly clear the risks that journalists now face in telling the world what they see. Their execution stood also as metaphor for the sinister designs of all those who do violence to journalism itself – silencing those who arm themselves with nothing more than pen, camera, and keyboard. Journalists need not be killed, of course, to bury the truth. Not long ago, we imagined a free press might blossom in a new Russia. Today, most Russians get their information from state-controlled broadcasters disseminating propaganda, conspiracy, jingoism. After the shoot-down of the Malaysian Airliner in Ukraine, the editor in chief of Russia 24 said this: “As state TV, our mission is to support the interests of the state. [Official] opinions are determinative for our programs, for our channel.” The predominant news report in Russia then, and since, has been an alternative universe, contradicting what all the world knows to be true about how 298 people came to die. In Hungary, a member of NATO and the European Union, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has moved to undermine an independent press with a crippling tax on advertising revenue. A media council can fine news organizations, blogs, and personal websites for vague offenses: Failure to provide “balanced coverage.” News that is “insulting to communities.” In Egypt over a year ago, Sky News cameraman Mick Deane was filming protests by supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi. An Egyptian military sniper shot him. Recalling that killing, his wife recently wrote: “I think the security forces just got tired of seeing him there.” She noted he was only doing his job. “Just like,” she wrote, “three journalists from the Al Jazeera network, including an Australian reporter, who are now serving long prison sentences in Cairo. And the three Egyptian journalists who were killed that same day, including a 26-year-old woman.” In recent weeks, Egyptian newspaper editors have pledged near-absolute support for the state, pledging to ban criticism of the police, army, and judiciary in their pages. In Venezuela, government regulations, withheld licenses, supply shortages, and lawsuits have pushed independent media into an abyss. New buyers emerge mysteriously, only to oust free-thinking columnists and disband investigative teams. In my own newsroom, the dangers for journalists working abroad have been felt all too acutely. Two years ago this August, while reporting in Syria, Austin Tice disappeared. He was a freelance journalist. He contributed articles to The Washington Post, McClatchy, and others. No one has heard from him or his captors. Humanity requires his release. Austin was one of more than 90 journalists, local and foreign, kidnapped in Syria in the past three years, the Committee to Protect Journalists reports. Worse, more than 70 journalists, most of them local, have been killed in that time. On July 22, our Jason Rezaian and his wife Yeganeh, also a journalist, were arrested along with two others in Iran. Jason is a citizen of the United States and Iran. He had dedicated himself to shedding light on the culture and people of his heritage. Today, though his wife has been released, Jason remains in a prison – more than 100 days after he was arrested. The government says he’s being investigated for a “crime” but won’t say what it is. His medical care is, by all appearances, substandard. He hasn’t been able to see a lawyer. The Iranian government should let this good man go so he can enjoy the freedom that is his right. * * * Recently, there has been hopeful anticipation that the Internet and social media will yield a golden era of free speech. In their outstanding book, “The New Digital Age,” Google’s Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen predict that “authoritarian governments will find their newly connected populations more difficult to control, repress and influence, while democratic states will be forced to include many more voices (individuals, organizations and companies) in their affairs.” And yet they note how authoritarian governments will have powerful weapons of their own, “derived from their position as gatekeeper” in a world of connectivity. Schmidt and Cohen believe new technologies give individuals the upper hand. I am not so confident. Almost a year ago, I spoke with a leading figure in the governance of the Internet. We talked about surveillance by the NSA, how it had tapped so voraciously into international data networks. He had been traveling Asia, gathering reactions of world leaders. Here’s what he did not hear: outrage. Here’s what he did hear: jealousy. Leaders told him: “We have excellent computer engineers. Why haven’t we been able to do this?” And they aspired to develop the capability themselves. Despite their long-term optimism, Schmidt and Cohen certainly see this coming. “States,” they note, “have an enormous amount of power over the mechanics of the Internet in their own countries. Because states have power over the physical infrastructure connectivity requires – the transmission towers, the routers, the switches – they control the entry, exit and waypoints for Internet data. They can limit content, control what hardware people are allowed to use and even create separate Internets.” China already blocks and filters information and sites — pervasively and with gusto. Turkey has blocked thousands of sites. Other governments openly block content based on what is deemed culturally or politically unacceptable. Schmidt and Cohen raise the prospect that countries will create their own domain name system. “No government has yet achieved an alternative system,” they write, “but if a government succeeded in doing so, it would effectively unplug its population from the global Internet and instead offer only a closed, national intranet.” We in the press are not prepared for a future so dark.  We need to think hard about how to get ready. I’m not here with answers. But we need to work together on developing some. We cannot do it soon enough. *      *       * And what about the United States? We have a distinct role in promoting free expression and a free press. In policy and practice, we must embrace these principles without reservation. Sadly, we are slipping. Our government is addicted to classifying documents, withholding information that citizens have a right to know. We have an Espionage Act that serves as invitation to punish the press for holding its government to account in its most fearsome national security powers. Proliferating leak investigations have sowed fear in government officials. Many avoid reporters, worried that any contact will make them objects of suspicion. FOIA requests are not addressed as the law requires. And we have a distinguished, determined, courageous journalist facing the prospect of prison for failure to reveal a source: Jim Risen of the New York Times deserves to remain free, deserves to be with his family, and should be allowed to do his job. Too many countries already threaten a free press and free expression. America must show that it is on a different path, one that has served us well since this nation was founded. We have been a beacon to others. We should remain one.

0,"Talk about fortuitous timing.  On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decided Kim v. Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in which the court concluded that the plaintiffs could take advantage of the “terrorism exception” to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) in their suit against DPK, a.k.a North Korea.  Here’s the intro to the opinion: Relying on the “terrorism exception” to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the family of Reverend Dong Shik Kim sued the North Korean government alleging that it abducted him, confined him to a kwan-li-so—a political penal-labor colony—tortured him, and, ultimately, killed him. When North Korea failed to appear, the Kims asked the district court for a default judgment pursuant to the provision of the Act that authorizes a court to enter judgment if the plaintiff “establishes his claim or right to relief by evidence that is satisfactory to the Court.” The district court denied that motion because the Kims had failed to produce “first-hand evidence” of what happened to the Reverend. We reverse. Admissible record evidence demonstrates that North Korea abducted Reverend Kim, that it invariably tortures and kills political prisoners, and that through terror and intimidation it prevents any information about those crimes from escaping to the outside world. Requiring a plaintiff to produce direct, firsthand evidence of the victim’s torture and murder would thus thwart the purpose of the terrorism exception: holding state sponsors of terrorism accountable for torture and extrajudicial killing. In these circumstances, we find the Kims’ evidence sufficiently “satisfactory” to require a default judgment.","Talk about fortuitous timing.  On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in which the court concluded that the plaintiffs could take advantage of the “terrorism exception” to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) in their suit against DPK, a.k.a North Korea.  Here’s the intro to the opinion: Relying on the “terrorism exception” to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the family of Reverend Dong Shik Kim sued the North Korean government alleging that it abducted him, confined him to a kwan-li-so—a political penal-labor colony—tortured him, and, ultimately, killed him. When North Korea failed to appear, the Kims asked the district court for a default judgment pursuant to the provision of the Act that authorizes a court to enter judgment if the plaintiff “establishes his claim or right to relief by evidence that is satisfactory to the Court.” The district court denied that motion because the Kims had failed to produce “first-hand evidence” of what happened to the Reverend. We reverse. Admissible record evidence demonstrates that North Korea abducted Reverend Kim, that it invariably tortures and kills political prisoners, and that through terror and intimidation it prevents any information about those crimes from escaping to the outside world. Requiring a plaintiff to produce direct, firsthand evidence of the victim’s torture and murder would thus thwart the purpose of the terrorism exception: holding state sponsors of terrorism accountable for torture and extrajudicial killing. In these circumstances, we find the Kims’ evidence sufficiently “satisfactory” to require a default judgment."
0,"Over the weekend Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) met with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In comments at a media appearance, Graham vowed: “I’m here to tell you, Mr. Prime Minister, that the Congress will follow your lead. In January of next year, there will be a vote on the Kirk-Menendez bill, bipartisan sanction legislation that says, if Iran walks away from the table, sanctions will be re-imposed; if Iran cheats regarding any deal that we enter to the Iranians, sanctions will be re-imposed. It is important to let the Iranians know that from an American point of view, sanctions are alive and well.” He added: “I also have legislation with Senator [Bob] Corker, that I believe will be bipartisan, and it says the following: If there’s a deal between the P5+1 regarding the Iranian nuclear program, it must come to the Congress for our approval before sanctions can be lifted permanently, as a check and balance against a bad deal.” The overall message was that Congress will no longer allow the president a free hand with Iran: The last time the international community tried to control a rogue regime’s nuclear ambitions, it resulted in a nuclear armed North Korea. What started as a small enrichment capability to be monitored by the United Nations, resulted in multiple nuclear weapons being procured by one of the most dangerous regimes in the world — North Korea. I fear above all else, Mr. Prime Minister, that if a deal was done between the P5+1 that allows an enrichment capability to be given to the Ayatollahs in Iran, that we will suffer the same fate. You will see a very vigorous Congress, when it comes to Iran. You will see a Congress making sure sanctions are real and will be re-imposed at the drop of a hat. You will see Congress wanting to have a say about any final deal. To be effective, the Kirk-Menendez legislation will need to provide the assurance of new sanctions at a date certain if Iran does not agree to minimally acceptable terms, including dismantling of its nuclear weapons infrastructure, a full accounting of past activities, dismantling of the Arak facility and unfettered inspections. Without a date certain, negotiations will drag on forever; without minimal terms, the administration will enter into a rotten deal that allows Iran to go nuclear. A source at a pro-Israel organization tells me, “The correlation of forces on Capitol Hill regarding Iran issues have significantly changed since the election. No longer can Iran sanctions legislation simply be blocked from a Senate vote.” He predicts, “Now, there is likely to be a strong bi-partisan coalition supporting tough prospective sanctions and a congressional role for any deal. Congress will surely be a force to be reckoned with.” As for the United Nations and the moribund “peace process,” Graham promised: “Any effort by the French, the Jordanians or anyone to avoid direct negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians over the peace process, anyone who tries to take this to the UN Security Council, there will be a violent backlash by the Congress that could include suspending funding to the United Nations.” Congress would be well advised to take additional actions to push back against the ongoing effort at the U.N. to delegitimize the Jewish state. It can start with oversight and hearings on the Obama administration’s decision to join the infamous U.N. Human Rights Council. The administration insisted that the United States’ participation would act as on a check on the UNHRC’s anti-Israel activities. The notion has been thoroughly and emphatically debunked by six years of continued anti-Israel rhetoric and actions. Without evidence that our presence is helping matters, Congress should halt any taxpayer funds from flowing to the UNHRC and, if nothing else, pass a resolution denouncing the body and our participation in it. Likewise, Congress needs to exercise appropriate oversight over the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which “by increasing the number of refugees, by maintaining that population in poverty, dependence, and anger, by understanding that the ‘right of return’ will be demanded by some Palestinian leaders . . . is helping the extremists to prevent peace and continue to wage a war of annihilation against Israel. This anti-peace policy is being funded largely by Americans: We’ve always been the largest donor to UNRWA, contributing about $4.4 billion since 1950.” UNRWA has deemed as refugees the children and grandchildren (including residents of other countries) of those who left Israel in 1946-1948. Congress should take up legislation previously introduced by Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) that would define a Palestinian refugee as “a person whose place of residence was Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, who was personally displaced as a result of the 1948 or 1967 Arab-Israeli conflicts, who currently does not reside in the West Bank or Gaza and who is not a citizen of any other state.” It should also demand an audit of UNRWA’s activities, its count of those receiving services and its use of textbooks it provides (to ensure that U.S. taxpayers are not subsidizing anti-Israel propaganda.) In sum, Congress in 2015 can begin to correct the errors of the Obama administration. If Democratic self-declared friends of Israel want to prove their mettle, they will cease carrying the administration’s water on these issues and join in veto-proof majorities to pass legislation that is essential to our own security and that of Israel.","Over the weekend Sen.

You did this with major investigations, with profoundly affecting narratives, and with energetic day-to-day coverage that kept us many steps ahead of the competition. You also did this by driving the conversation on the web, the world’s gathering place, assuring that The Post was smart and fast and attuned to what readers want to know now. The year also saw huge strides on the digital front. Our audience is global, and it is big, and our potential readership is even greater. In the past year, as the numbers show, we embraced the opportunity – with an openness to telling stories in new ways, with sensitivity to how and when the public wants its news, with increased sophistication in social networks that serve as grand information boulevards, and with an entrepreneurial spirit that has us introducing path-breaking new products. For good reason, your work has drawn attention and praise from our colleagues in the press and from the public. That, of course, is not what inspires you to do this work. Even with upheaval in our profession, your sense of mission remains strong. We have that as our compass.

Lois rejoins The Post with enormous enthusiasm and a bounty of ideas. Above all, she understands that our growing events business is an extension of our journalism. That means you’ll find her reaching out to everyone in the newsroom, seeking your help, advice, and participation. Lois has been the Events Editor for Politico, serving as the content driver for its journalistic events — and the newsroom liaison to the business/operations team. This year, she helped shaped content and programming for dozens of events, including Politico’s national multi-platform series,Women Rule and What Works. In taking on her new role, Lois succeeds Mary Jordan, who has excelled as Editor of Washington Post Live for almost five years and now eagerly returns to reporting. She will join the national politics team as we gear up fast for the 2016 presidential election. All of us feel deep gratitude to Mary for the energy, journalistic chops, and wisdom she brought to this important and difficult job. Washington Post Live is a high-visibility outlet for showcasing our journalism and convening key figures in Washington, across the nation and throughout the world for insightful, forward-looking and newsworthy discussions.  Our goal is to continue building a first-in-class events operation. Lois brings to this mission an understanding of Washington Post values and ethics, journalistic judgment, a keen grasp of digital strategies and social media, and a vast network of national contacts. She also brings a wealth of experience. Before leaving for Newsweek in 2011, Lois spent two extraordinary decades at The Post. Her career was launched in the Style section writing high-impact profiles of Washington’s power players. She was a regional correspondent in the Southwest, covered seven presidential campaigns, and covered education for the national staff. She also pioneered some of the paper’s most successful ventures – including the launch of “The Reliable Source” and The Post’s first online video interview series, “The Obama Era: Voices of Power.” Lois will report directly to me and work closely with Bob Bierman, general manager of Washington Post Live, Steve Hills, and Fred Ryan.

0,"They are two generations apart but very much on the same page. Former secretary of state George P. Shultz and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) understand what is at stake in the myriad of conflicts and challenges we now face. Shultz, along with former secretaries Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Cotton has written an op-ed. The statements of both should be taken to heart. Shultz was one of the best-regarded secretaries of state in modern times, so his advice and application of principles enunciated in the Reagan administration are worth heeding: 1.) You must actually execute the ideas you have; 2.) Be realistic about the world; 3.) Do not neglect the military (Sequestration, he said, is “legislative insanity. … You better get rid of that.”); 4. “Think through your agenda. … Stick to your agenda,” he said, rather than be knocked off course by opponents’ agenda; 5.) “Be very careful with your words. Mean what you say. Say what you mean. … No empty threats.”; and 6.) Engage our enemies, but do it from an agenda and from a position of strength. As he points out, whether on Russia or Iran, the Obama administration has violated virtually all of these precepts. On Iran, he cautioned: “Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism. … They act directly. They act indirectly.” He explained that “if it weren’t for Hezbollah, Assad would not be [in power] in Syria.” He points out the Iranians are developing ballistic missiles. As for the Obama administration, Shultz scoffed, “They haven’t got the table set yet.” We should be including in negotiations issues such as terrorism and ICBMs, but the administration has ruled out these subjects because Iran objects. Even worse, he says, we have already granted the so-called right to enrich. “Their agenda is to get rid of the sanctions,” he said. “And they’re doing pretty well.” He cautioned against so-called snap-back sanctions since as difficult as it is to impose sanctions, it is harder still to bring them back once they’ve been lifted. He argued that Iran should know it faces additional sanctions unless it gives up its nuclear ambitions. Most important, Shultz explained that whether we are talking about Iran, Russia or the Islamic State, we need to understand that these bad actors are attacking “the way the world works,” the state system of respected borders. Terrorism, he says, is a tactic, but the goal is to erase national borders and subsume independent countries to these entities’ control. And finally, he repeated a number of times that the administration must engage in much more consultation with Congress. “If you want me in on the landing, include me in the takeoff,” he recalled were the Reagan administration’s watchwords. All of this is wise counsel, and it so happens is shared by Cotton, whose op-ed was no doubt written without the benefit of the former secretaries’ testimony. Like Shultz, Cotton understands the nature of the Iranian regime. (“Iran has been responsible for the killing and maiming of thousands of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. . . . Iran also continues to terrorize the civilized world. It is the worst state sponsor of terrorism on the planet, according to President Obama’s State Department. Iran is a lead financier and arms supplier of Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, terrorist organizations dedicated to destroying Israel. Iran and its proxies also have a nasty habit of blowing up Jews around the world, from Argentina to Bulgaria to Israel. . .  Consider, too, what has happened in the past few weeks. Iranian-aligned Shiite militants have seized the capital of Yemen. Iran continues to prop up Bashar Assad’s outlaw regime in Syria. An Iranian general was discovered near Israel’s border preparing offensive operations with Hezbollah against Israel—fortunately, he was discovered by an Israeli missile. Iran signed a new defense pact with Russia. And Iran proceeded with a sham prosecution against an American journalist held hostage there.”) Cotton also understands that we are engaged in serial concession-granting while Iran advances on all these fronts, which cannot even be discussed at the negotiating table: To end this appeasement, the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday approved legislation that would impose new conditional and prospective sanctions on Iran if nuclear negotiations fail. The proposed legislation also calls for congressional approval of any nuclear agreement. It would have been preferable never to have eased the economic sanctions on Iran to begin with, but 20 months of negotiations is more than enough time for a process that Secretary of State 
John Kerry once predicted would take three to six months. The analysis from Cotton and Shultz is virtually identical and their recommendations should be heeded. We must rebuild our military, say what we mean, exercise leverage we have with Iran and recognize that we are at war with jihadists who threaten the state system and Western civilization itself. The president is clueless and refuses to engage in normal consultation with Congress, but that only increases lawmakers’ responsibility to govern wisely and attend to the federal government’s primary duty, national security. As Cotton put it, “Perhaps the Obama administration isn’t so much worried about the ayatollahs’ delicate sensibilities as it is focused on avoiding any deadline for itself or congressional review of its actions. This makes congressional action all the more necessary. Congress must protect America from a bad deal—anything less than Iran’s complete nuclear disarmament. The U.S. cannot live with a nuclear Iran, whether it is achieved with a formal agreement or in slow motion through endless negotiations.” Let’s hope Cotton and his generation of Republicans are as wise and firm as Shultz has been over the decades — and that their views prevail with Congress and eventually inform the outlook of the next commander in chief.  ","They are two generations apart but very much on the same page.

He should be permitted to meet at once with his lawyer. Iran’s handling of this case bears no resemblance to justice; it has been a sham and a tragic farce.”"
0,"  FOR MORE than seven months, Washington Post reporter and bureau chief Jason Rezaian has been detained in Iran, for reasons as opaque as the justice system’s approach to his case. Of course, we use the word “justice” in this context very loosely. “Iran’s handling of this case bears no resemblance to justice; it has been a sham and a tragic farce,” Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, said recently in a statement. Rezaian and his wife, reporter Yeganeh Salehi, were arrested last July. She was released on bail, but Rezaian has been detained since, and is in Tehran’s Evin Prison, where this month he received medical treatment and was released from solitary confinement. “The exact nature of the charges against him has never been made clear,” The Post reported this month, “other than a statement saying he was accused of activities beyond the scope of journalism.” Rezaian, an American-born dual national, has been detained longer in Iran than any journalist before him, The Post reports. Rezaian, 38, has been denied contact with a chosen attorney. It is “outrageous,” Baron said in his statement, “that the Iranian court is blocking a well-regarded lawyer chosen by Jason’s family from gaining access to him.” And so the days go by with no clear charges, and no real answers, and no true justice — even as the change.org petition seeking his release swells with signatures. Until justice is at hand, Comic Riffs will continue to count the days of this “tragic farce.” And each day, our thoughts are with our colleague and his family.","  FOR MORE than seven months, Washington Post reporter and bureau chief Jason Rezaian has been detained in Iran, for reasons as opaque as the justice system’s approach to his case.

0,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that his planned speech to Congress is not meant to signal any disrespect for President Obama, nor to insert political partisanship into the U.S.-Israel relationship. “Never has so much been written about a speech that hasn’t been given,” Netanyahu said about the address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday. “My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the esteemed office that he holds. I have great respect for both.” Speaking at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on Monday, Netanyahu said he intends to focus his remarks to Congress on the potential of an international nuclear deal with Iran that he believes could ""threaten the survival of Israel."" Netanyahu said those who see a partisan motive in his address have misconstrued his purpose. He has frequently addressed AIPAC, but he has never before addressed Congress without the expressed blessing of the White House. Netanyahu was invited to speak by House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who did not inform the White House of the invitation in advance. “Israel has always been a bipartisan issue,” he said. “Israel should always remain a bipartisan issue.” Netanyahu said his purpose Tuesday is not to ""inject Israel into the American partisan debate."" Deploying one of the visual aids for which his international speeches have become known, Netanyahu said Iran is such a large threat to Israel’s future that he cannot stay silent. He displayed a map showing Iran’s alleged support of terrorism on five continents, and accused Iran of ""developing, as we speak, the capacity to make nuclear weapons, lots of them.” [Samantha Power on Iranian  bomb: ""We will not let it happen.""] Netanyahu said he wants to make his case before Congress, where there is bipartisan legislation that would impose additional sanctions on Iran. President Obama has said he would veto the bill. Netanyahu's stance on Iran puts him at odds with the Obama administration, which has been working to hammer out a nuclear deal with Iran. Secretary of State John F. Kerry is scheduled to meet Tuesday morning with his Iranian counterpart in Geneva to work out the framework of the deal before a March 24 deadline. “The purpose of my speech to Congress tomorrow is to speak up about a potential deal with Iran that could threaten Israel’s future,” Netanyahu said. He said he had a moral obligation to speak up ahead of the deadline. Israel is strong but vulnerable, and it must not only defend itself militarily but stand up for itself on the world stage, Netanyahu said. “We have a voice,"" he said. ""Tomorrow, as prime minister of the one and only Jewish state, I plan to use that voice,” he added to applause. President Obama said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that the speech is a disruption that will not permanently damage U.S.-Israel relations. Obama said that while there is ""substantial disagreement"" between the two countries on whether to broker an international deal to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, the fissure will not be ""permanently destructive"" to the relationship. Netanyahu's trip to Washington is extraordinary, both in the content of the speech he is scheduled to give Tuesday and the fissures that it has created between the Israeli government and the White House, leading Jewish American groups and Jewish Democrats. “Disagreements between allies are only natural” and nothing new, Netanyahu said, and understandable given the different role and geography of the United States and Israel. He ticked off several past periods of tension, each of which passed without permanent damage to the U.S.-Israeli bond, and said that Israel and the United States are more like a family than friends. “Disagreements in the family are always uncomfortable, but we must always remember that we are family,” he said. The White House said Obama would not meet with Netanyahu because the speech is so close to Israel's elections. Obama told Retuers he would be more than happy to meet with Netanyahu after election day. ""This is not a personal issue. I think that it is important for every country in its relationship with the United States to recognize that the U.S. has a process of making policy,"" Obama said. When asked if Obama watched the AIPAC speech, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, ""I don't believe that he did."" Netanyahu spoke shortly after the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, defended the Obama administration’s approach to negotiations with Iran over that country's nuclear program and pledged anew that the United States will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. She said U.S. support for Israel is bipartisan, and that U.S. promises to the partnership with Israel are ""bedrock commitments."" Tensions between the two sides have been coming to a boiling point since Netanyahu's speech was announced in January. They rapidly escalated last week, after national security adviser Susan E. Rice, who is also scheduled to speak at the conference Monday evening, denounced Netanyahu's speech to Congress, calling it ""destructive"" to the relationship between the United States and Israel. Rice said it ""injected a degree of partisanship"" to the bond between the two countries. ""It's always been bipartisan. We need to keep it that way. We want it that way. I think Israel wants it that way. The American people want it that way. And when it becomes injected or infused with politics, that's a problem,"" Rice said. Netanyahu is facing a tougher-than-expected contest for reelection to an unprecedented fourth term on March 17. Kerry tried to tamp down tensions over the past few days, and Monday he said that anti-Israel bias by the U.N. Human Rights Panel is undercutting its mission. ""The United States will oppose any effort by any group or any participant to abuse the U.N. system in order to delegitimize or isolate Israel,"" Kerry said from Geneva, where he is negotiating ahead of the March 24 deadline for the Iran nuclear deal. ""Israel's security is absolutely at the forefront of all of our minds, but frankly, so is the security of all the other countries in the region, so is our security in the United States,"" Kerry said. President Obama laid out the parameters of a potential plan to Reuters, asserting that Iran must commit to freezing its nuclear program for at least 10 years for an agreement to be reached. Obama said the likelihood of an agreement is not certain; Earnest said odds were ""only at best 50-50"" Monday afternoon. “If, in fact, Iran is willing to agree to double-digit years of keeping their program where it is right now and, in fact, rolling back elements of it that currently exist ... if we’ve got that, and we’ve got a way of verifying that, there’s no other steps we can take that would give us such assurance that they don’t have a nuclear weapon,"" Obama said in the interview. Obama said a major hurdle would be Iran agreeing to exacting demands for inspection and keeping enriched uranium levels very low. ""But if they do agree to it, it would be far more effective in controlling their nuclear program than any military action we could take, any military action Israel could take and far more effective than sanctions will be,"" Obama said. While Netanyahu is adamantly against a deal, Earnest said the prime minister has not ""laid out that strategy"" to prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon, while Obama has.  Obama, as Secretary of State John Kerry said last week, asserted that Netanyahu has been wrong on Iran before, when he opposed a 2013 interim deal with the country. ""Netanyahu made all sorts of claims. This was going to be a terrible deal. This was going to result in Iran getting $50 billion worth of relief. Iran would not abide by the agreement. None of that has come true,"" Obama said. ""It has turned out that in fact, during this period we’ve seen Iran not advance its program. In many ways, it’s rolled back elements of its program."" The invitation has also rankled congressional Democrats, many of whom will not attend the speech. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that Netanyahu's point of view is not emblematic of the entire Jewish community, which he claimed he would be representing in his speech to Congress. ""He doesn't speak for me on this,” the California Democrat said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union."" ""I think it's a rather arrogant statement. I think the Jewish community is like any other community. There are different points of view. I think that arrogance does not befit Israel, candidly.""

0,"Update: Archived video of the press conference is available below. This post has also been updated to include text of the remarks given at the event. The National Press Club is hosting a press conference today at 2pm ET to discuss the latest developments in the case of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent who has been imprisoned in Iran since July 2014. Statements are expected from John Hughes, NPC president, Ali Rezaian, Jason’s brother, and Douglas Jehl, Washington Post foreign editor. Boxing legend Muhammad Ali also issued a statement urging Iran to free Jason Rezaian. Remarks given by John Hughes, president of the National Press Club (edited for brevity): Good afternoon. I’m John Hughes, president of the National Press Club, and an editor for Bloomberg’s First Word, the breaking news desk in Washington. We are here to talk about the case of Washington Post Reporter Jason Rezaian. Jason has been held in an Iranian prison since July 22. This is the longest captivity for a Western journalist in Iran. I am joined up here by Ali Rezaian, Jason’s brother, and Doug Jehl, Jason’s editor at the Washington Post. We at the National Press Club, on behalf of our 3,100 members worldwide, speak out year round on press freedom through our programs and statements. Today, we are taking the additional step of holding a news conference. Why? First, unfortunately, more journalists around the world are being prevented from doing their jobs. We at the Club are raising our voices to fight this trend. Second, with Jason, this is personal. Washington is our home. Jason’s newspaper lands on our front porches. It is read at our breakfast tables. Jason is part of our Washington journalism community — he’s like family. So today, we are making a special announcement. It is my great honor to announce that the Club’s Press Freedom Committee, and Board of Governors, voted to give Jason one of our greatest recognitions — the John Aubuchon Press Freedom Award. This distinction is for journalists who face adversity in the performance of their craft and who show a commitment to press freedom. We will recognize all Club award winners at a prestigious dinner in our ballroom on July 29. We expect Jason will be free to collect this award. In the past, we have seen nations large and small decide that they do not want us to go to the microphone and say “this winner cannot be with us tonight because he or she continues to be held in a prison.” It is in Iran’s power to prevent this from happening. Iran can set Jason free. We hope and believe leaders will do the right thing. It is time — it is past time — for Jason to be released. We at the National Press Club will raise our voices, again and again, until that happens. People from change.org are here today. Can you stand up please? Later, they will be available to help those of you in the room sign the petition for Jason. But now can you all bring up those boxes please. Thanks – now these are boxes of signatures like this and there are about 230,000 of them that have been collected so far. That number is going to go up after the interest we generate today. Please add your voice to this cause. Earlier today, the National Press Club was proud to release a statement from the Greatest — Muhammad Ali, about Jason’s case. We can’t tell you how excited and honored we were to do this. That Muhmmad Ali was willing to speak out on Jason’s case tells you what kind of Champ he truly is. We want to state publicly how grateful we are that he did this. Before we take questions I want recognize some special guests. Jason’s former classmates from the Marin Academy are here, led by Rachel Goeiz. Can you all please stand. These folks have known Jason for many years. A journalism teacher who worked with Jason is here, Timathea Workman. Can you raise your hand? These people are here today to support Jason. He is that kind of person, and many people feel a strong connection to him and are working to set him free. Remarks given by Douglas Jehl, foreign editor of The Washington Post: Last year was among the most dangerous years ever recorded for journalists working abroad. Reporters and photographers working in zones of war and deadly disease make incalculable sacrifices for readers around the world, including readers of The Washington Post. At The Post, we feel particular outrage at the severe treatment endured by Jason Rezaian, our cherished Tehran correspondent, who has now been detained in Iran for 233 days. At every turn, Iran’s handling of the case has reinforced an impression of state-sponsored injustice. Jason is a fully-accredited journalist who has done nothing wrong. He has been held since July 22 without access to a lawyer, without visits by consular authorities, without a public accounting of the charges against him. He has been subjected to extensive interrogation, which has taken a significant toll. We know that fairness and justice could only result in Jason’s immediate release. The approaching Iranian New Year, Noruz, should be a season of mercy, and we call on Iran to act on this spirit. Until Jason is free, his treatment by Iran can only be seen as an abomination worthy of the world’s condemnation. Remarks given by Ali Rezaian, brother of Jason Rezaian: Thank you all for joining us today. First I would like to thank the National Press Club for making this event possible. I would also like to thank Reporters Without Borders and Change.org for their tireless efforts on Jason’s behalf. Finally, I’d like to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts, both public and private, of The Washington Post and our family’s advisors who have been working towards Jason and Yegi’s release for these past 232 days. Before we take questions I want to update you on Jason and Yegi’s situation and give you a sense of our ongoing efforts to raise international awareness of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s unprecedented detention of a credentialed journalist. I’ll also discuss expected future milestones in the case. As of today, my brother Jason has been held in Iran’s Evin prison for nearly eight months. This is twice as long as any other western journalist. Throughout his ordeal, Jason has been subjected to intense interrogation, isolation and has been denied timely medical treatment. The Iranian government has never provided evidence of any wrongdoing on his part and they have systematically ignored their own legal process to extend his detention, deprive Jason of his right to legal counsel and deny virtually all his protections under the Iranian constitution. As you can imagine, Jason’s imprisonment has been tremendously difficult on him. For nearly five months, Jason was held in solitary confinement, frequently interrogated for 7-10 hours per day and then subjected to week-long periods of isolation. Within the first two months of his detention Jason lost nearly 50 pounds. He suffered though months of debilitating back pain and serious infections, exacerbated by delays in treatment. I am happy to report that, in the recent months, Jason has been treated by appropriate physicians and has been moved from solitary into a shared cell. But while we are told that his physical condition has improved, we know that these past 8 months have taken a great toll on his psychological condition. Any person subjected to these conditions would be psychologically scarred, but in Jason’s case there is the added burden of knowing that, without even the pretense of evidence, the country which he worked so hard to demystify to the world continues to deprive him of his rights and ignores their legal process to prevent him from presenting a defense. While Jason’s wife Yeganeh was released on bail after nearly two months in Evin, she continues to suffer. For months, she was forbidden to consult an attorney. Her press credentials were revoked, and she lives in constant fear of punishment for any misstep in her daily life. All this while she works desperately within Iran to free Jason and is unable to interact with many of her friends. In early January, their case was referred to the Revolutionary Court and assigned to a judge known for imposing harsh sentences and limiting defendants’ ability to prepare and present a defense. Since the case entered the judiciary, Yeganeh and Jason have, after nearly six months, been able to hire an attorney, though pressure and illegal tactics were employed to prevent Jason from retaining separate council. I am happy to report that Jason and Yeganeh’s attorney has begun the review of their case file. Separately, the judge recently approved her request for more frequent visitation and Jason and Yegi be allowed to resume face to face meetings. We have been fortunate enough to have a tremendous support system which I mentioned earlier and I want to highlight some of our current efforts. First I would like to call your attention to the letter released today and joined by many notable journalists and international organizations calling on the leader of Iran’s judiciary to revisit this case. We are confident that any fair reading of the evidence will result in Jason and Yegi’s immediate release. Today, we are also making available two videos for your use. The first video is produced by The Washington Post and focuses on the facts of Jason and Yegi’s ordeal. The second video, produced by Jason’s friend of 35 years Robbie Stauder, focuses on our mother’s trip to Iran in December to visit Jason. We are thrilled by the overwhelming response to our petition on 
change.org/freejason. As an individual you can join the nearly two hundred and fifty thousand people who have signed the petition at 
change.org/freejason. It is notable that this petition has remained one of the fastest growing petitions on change.org for the past month with people from over 80 countries calling for Jason’s immediate release.

Thinking about what’s ahead– When my mother returned from Iran in January she told me Jason said “Tell Ali to get me out before my birthday.” At the time, that seemed like a reasonable time line, albeit one that I do not control. Jason’s birthday is this coming Sunday the 15th. Iranians around the world celebrate New Years, Nowruz, at the Spring Solstice. This year it falls on March 20th. This is a very significant time of year for Iranians. A time of new beginnings when families gather and a time of generosity and mercy. Jason and Yegi’s lawyer has requested a temporary bail for Jason for the first five days of the new year. In the spirit of Nowruz, I would ask all those in power in Iran consider if they truly believe that Jason should begin the new year in Evin, and that Judge Salavati please allow Jason to spend the Nowruz with his wife and her family.","Update: Archived video of the press conference is available below.

We will recognize all Club award winners at a prestigious dinner in our ballroom on July 29. We expect Jason will be free to collect this award. In the past, we have seen nations large and small decide that they do not want us to go to the microphone and say “this winner cannot be with us tonight because he or she continues to be held in a prison.” It is in Iran’s power to prevent this from happening. Iran can set Jason free. We hope and believe leaders will do the right thing. It is time — it is past time — for Jason to be released. We at the National Press Club will raise our voices, again and again, until that happens. People from change.org are here today. Can you stand up please? Later, they will be available to help those of you in the room sign the petition for Jason. But now can you all bring up those boxes please. Thanks – now these are boxes of signatures like this and there are about 230,000 of them that have been collected so far. That number is going to go up after the interest we generate today. Please add your voice to this cause. Earlier today, the National Press Club was proud to release a statement from the Greatest — Muhammad Ali, about Jason’s case. We can’t tell you how excited and honored we were to do this. That Muhmmad Ali was willing to speak out on Jason’s case tells you what kind of Champ he truly is. We want to state publicly how grateful we are that he did this. Before we take questions I want recognize some special guests. Jason’s former classmates from the Marin Academy are here, led by Rachel Goeiz. Can you all please stand. These folks have known Jason for many years. A journalism teacher who worked with Jason is here, Timathea Workman. Can you raise your hand? These people are here today to support Jason. He is that kind of person, and many people feel a strong connection to him and are working to set him free. Remarks given by Douglas Jehl, foreign editor of The Washington Post: Last year was among the most dangerous years ever recorded for journalists working abroad. Reporters and photographers working in zones of war and deadly disease make incalculable sacrifices for readers around the world, including readers of The Washington Post. At The Post, we feel particular outrage at the severe treatment endured by Jason Rezaian, our cherished Tehran correspondent, who has now been detained in Iran for 233 days. At every turn, Iran’s handling of the case has reinforced an impression of state-sponsored injustice. Jason is a fully-accredited journalist who has done nothing wrong. He has been held since July 22 without access to a lawyer, without visits by consular authorities, without a public accounting of the charges against him. He has been subjected to extensive interrogation, which has taken a significant toll. We know that fairness and justice could only result in Jason’s immediate release. The approaching Iranian New Year, Noruz, should be a season of mercy, and we call on Iran to act on this spirit. Until Jason is free, his treatment by Iran can only be seen as an abomination worthy of the world’s condemnation. Remarks given by Ali Rezaian, brother of Jason Rezaian: Thank you all for joining us today. First I would like to thank the National Press Club for making this event possible. I would also like to thank Reporters Without Borders and Change.org for their tireless efforts on Jason’s behalf. Finally, I’d like to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts, both public and private, of The Washington Post and our family’s advisors who have been working towards Jason and Yegi’s release for these past 232 days. Before we take questions I want to update you on Jason and Yegi’s situation and give you a sense of our ongoing efforts to raise international awareness of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s unprecedented detention of a credentialed journalist. I’ll also discuss expected future milestones in the case. As of today, my brother Jason has been held in Iran’s Evin prison for nearly eight months. This is twice as long as any other western journalist. Throughout his ordeal, Jason has been subjected to intense interrogation, isolation and has been denied timely medical treatment. The Iranian government has never provided evidence of any wrongdoing on his part and they have systematically ignored their own legal process to extend his detention, deprive Jason of his right to legal counsel and deny virtually all his protections under the Iranian constitution. As you can imagine, Jason’s imprisonment has been tremendously difficult on him. For nearly five months, Jason was held in solitary confinement, frequently interrogated for 7-10 hours per day and then subjected to week-long periods of isolation. Within the first two months of his detention Jason lost nearly 50 pounds. He suffered though months of debilitating back pain and serious infections, exacerbated by delays in treatment. I am happy to report that, in the recent months, Jason has been treated by appropriate physicians and has been moved from solitary into a shared cell. But while we are told that his physical condition has improved, we know that these past 8 months have taken a great toll on his psychological condition. Any person subjected to these conditions would be psychologically scarred, but in Jason’s case there is the added burden of knowing that, without even the pretense of evidence, the country which he worked so hard to demystify to the world continues to deprive him of his rights and ignores their legal process to prevent him from presenting a defense. While Jason’s wife Yeganeh was released on bail after nearly two months in Evin, she continues to suffer. For months, she was forbidden to consult an attorney. Her press credentials were revoked, and she lives in constant fear of punishment for any misstep in her daily life. All this while she works desperately within Iran to free Jason and is unable to interact with many of her friends. In early January, their case was referred to the Revolutionary Court and assigned to a judge known for imposing harsh sentences and limiting defendants’ ability to prepare and present a defense. Since the case entered the judiciary, Yeganeh and Jason have, after nearly six months, been able to hire an attorney, though pressure and illegal tactics were employed to prevent Jason from retaining separate council. I am happy to report that Jason and Yeganeh’s attorney has begun the review of their case file. Separately, the judge recently approved her request for more frequent visitation and Jason and Yegi be allowed to resume face to face meetings. We have been fortunate enough to have a tremendous support system which I mentioned earlier and I want to highlight some of our current efforts. First I would like to call your attention to the letter released today and joined by many notable journalists and international organizations calling on the leader of Iran’s judiciary to revisit this case. We are confident that any fair reading of the evidence will result in Jason and Yegi’s immediate release. Today, we are also making available two videos for your use. The first video is produced by The Washington Post and focuses on the facts of Jason and Yegi’s ordeal. The second video, produced by Jason’s friend of 35 years Robbie Stauder, focuses on our mother’s trip to Iran in December to visit Jason. We are thrilled by the overwhelming response to our petition on 
change.org/freejason. As an individual you can join the nearly two hundred and fifty thousand people who have signed the petition at 
change.org/freejason. It is notable that this petition has remained one of the fastest growing petitions on change.org for the past month with people from over 80 countries calling for Jason’s immediate release.

Thinking about what’s ahead– When my mother returned from Iran in January she told me Jason said “Tell Ali to get me out before my birthday.” At the time, that seemed like a reasonable time line, albeit one that I do not control. Jason’s birthday is this coming Sunday the 15th. Iranians around the world celebrate New Years, Nowruz, at the Spring Solstice. This year it falls on March 20th. This is a very significant time of year for Iranians. A time of new beginnings when families gather and a time of generosity and mercy. Jason and Yegi’s lawyer has requested a temporary bail for Jason for the first five days of the new year. In the spirit of Nowruz, I would ask all those in power in Iran consider if they truly believe that Jason should begin the new year in Evin, and that Judge Salavati please allow Jason to spend the Nowruz with his wife and her family."
1,"American boxing legend Muhammad Ali has called on Iranian officials to release Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post correspondent who has been imprisoned since July. In a statement issued Thursday morning through the National Press Club, Ali said: “It is my great hope that the government and judiciary of Iran will end the prolonged detention of journalist Jason Rezaian and provide him with access to all of his legal options.” The 73-year-old cultural icon’s statement was distributed hours before a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, where Ali Rezaian appealed for his brother’s immediate release. Jason Rezaian was arrested at home in Tehran on July 22 with his wife, Iranian reporter Yeganeh Salehi. She was eventually released on bail; but Rezaian — an American-born dual national — remains in Tehran’s Evin Prison. He has been detained for more than 230 days. [Full Washington Post coverage of Jason Rezaian’s detention] In his statement, Ali — a Muslim American, like Rezaian— called the jailed journalist “a man of peace and great faith, a man whose dedication and respect for the Iranian people is evident in his work.” He added: “I support his family, friends and colleagues in their efforts to obtain his release.” Others who have called for Rezaian’s release include more than 230,000 people who have signed a related change.org petition addressed to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, its president, Hassan Rouhani, and the country’s judiciary chief, Sadegh Larijani. U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry has also urged Iran “to drop any and all charges against Jason and release him immediately.” Rezaian has been detained for more than seven months, but the Iranian government has not publicly identified the nature of the charges against him. Last month, Iranian officials allowed Rezaian to seek medical treatment and then gave him access to a lawyer, though it was not the one he had requested. Ali, who is battling Parkinson’s disease and was hospitalized late last year after suffering a severe urinary tract infection, rarely makes public pronouncements. He commented on the 2013 death of Nelson Mandela, but hasn’t been heard from much since then. Here is his statement, in full: With the Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful I am sorry that I cannot be physically present to lend my support in person but I pray my words will provide relief to the efforts to secure the release of Jason Rezaian. Insha’Allah, it is my great hope that the government and judiciary of Iran will end the prolonged detention of journalist Jason Rezaian and provide him with access to all of his legal options.

We understand that these charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 to 20 years in prison. The grave charges against Jason that Iran has now disclosed could not be more ludicrous. It is absurd and despicable to assert, as Iran’s judiciary is now claiming, that Jason’s work first as a freelance reporter and then as The Post’s Tehran correspondent amounted to espionage or otherwise posed any threat to Iranian national security. Jason is an accredited journalist whose fairness and professionalism have earned him public praise even from Iran’s president and Iran’s foreign minister. Whatever its motive, Iran’s judiciary is presenting the claims that are transparently baseless. The charges include “conducting propaganda against the establishment,’’ “collaborating with hostile governments,’’ and “collecting information about internal and foreign policy and providing them to individuals with malicious intent,’’ according to the lawyer’s statement. If there is any hint of light in Iran’s levying of these chilling charges, it is that Iran’s accusations against Jason will soon be heard in the court of public opinion and also in a court of law, albeit in a Revolutionary Court before a judge whose unfairness has already earned him sanctions from the European Community for violations of human rights. It is important to note that the judge, Abolghassem Salavati, did not permit to Jason to choose his own counsel, rejecting several initial choices. We continue to believe that Jason’s defense team should be permitted to grow to include additional lawyers of his choosing. We call on Judge Salavati and the Iranian judiciary to depart from past practice and instead demonstrate to the world that they can indeed render a fair and impartial judgment in the Iranian system. We know that Jason and his lawyer, Leila Ahsan, are preparing for a trial, which if conducted fairly, will finally allow them to show Iran and the world that these charges are absurd and scurrilous. Jason’s wife, Yeganeh Saleh, who is also a journalist, also faces an impending trial on an equally baseless charge. In the more than 260 dark days that have passed since Jason and Yegi were detained, Iran has shown only disdain for the concepts of humanity, fairness and the rule of law that it purports to embrace. The manufactured charges against Jason and Yegi that Iran’s courts are now putting forth represent propaganda, not justice. The world will be watching; any just outcome to this tragic charade can result only in Jason and Yegi’s exoneration and immediate release.

0,"Good evening, everybody. Welcome to the White House Correspondents’ dinner. A night when Washington celebrates itself. Somebody’s got to do it. And welcome to the fourth quarter of my presidency. It’s true — that’s Michelle cheering. The fact is I feel more loose and relaxed than ever. Those Joe Biden shoulder massages — they’re like magic. You should try one. Oh, you have. [The funniest lines in President Obama’s White House correspondents’ dinner speech] I am determined to make the most of every moment I have left. After the midterm elections, my advisors asked me “Mr. President, do you have a bucket list?”  And I said, “Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.” Take executive action on immigration. Bucket. New climate regulations. Bucket. It’s the right thing to do. My new attitude is paying off. Look at my Cuba policy. The Castro brothers are here tonight. Welcome to America, amigos. Que pasa? What? It’s the Castros from Texas. Oh. Hi, Joaquin. Hi, Julian. Anyway, being president is never easy. I still have to fix a broken immigration system, issue veto threats, negotiate with Iran. All while finding time to pray five times a day. Which is strenuous. And it is no wonder that that people keep pointing out how the presidency has aged me. I look so old John Boehner’s already invited Benjamin Netanyahu to speak at my funeral. Meanwhile, Michelle hasn’t aged a day. I ask her what her secret is and she just says “fresh fruits and vegetables.” It’s aggravating. Fact is though, at this point my legacy is finally beginning to take shape. The economy is getting better. Nine in ten Americans now have health coverage. Today thanks to Obamacare you no longer have to worry about losing your insurance if you lose your job. You’re welcome, Senate democrats. [Full recap of the 2015 White House correspondents’ dinner] Look, it is true I have not managed to make everybody happy. Six years into my presidency some people still say I’m arrogant, aloof, condescending. Some people are so dumb. No wonder I don’t meet with them. And that’s not all people say about me. A few weeks ago, Dick Cheney says he thinks I’m the worst president of his lifetime. Which is interesting because I think Dick Cheney is the worst president of my lifetime. Quite a coincidence. I mean everybody’s got something to say these days. Mike Huckabee recently said people shouldn’t join our military until a true conservative is elected president. Think about that. It was so outrageous 47 Ayatollahs wrote us a letter trying to explain to Huckabee how our system works. It gets worse. Just this week, Michele Bachmann actually predicted that I would bring about the biblical end of days. Now, that’s a legacy. That’s big. I mean, Lincoln, Washington, they didn’t do that. You know, I just have to put this stuff aside. I have to stay focused on my job. Because for many Americans this is still a time of deep uncertainty.  For example, I have one friend just a few weeks ago, she was making millions of dollars a year and she’s now living out of a van in Iowa. Meanwhile, back here in our nation’s capital we’re always dealing with new challenges. I’m happy to report that the Secret Service — thanks to some excellent reporting by white house correspondents — they are focusing on some of the issues that have come up. And, they have finally figured out a fool proof way to keep people off my lawn. [image of John McCain] It works. It’s not just fence jumpers. Some of you know, a few months ago, a drone crashed landed out back. That was pretty serious, but don’t worry, we installed a new state-of-the-art security system. [image of Joe Biden] You know, let me set the record straight. I tease Joe Biden, but you know he has been in my side for seven years. I love that man. [applause] He’s not just a great Vice President, he is a great friend. We’ve gotten so close in some places in Indiana, they won’t serve us pizza anymore. [laughter] [applause] I want to thank our host for the evening, a Chicago girl, the incredibly talented Cecily Strong. [applause] On Saturday Night Live, Cecily impersonates CNN  anchor Brooke Baldwin, which is surprising, because usually the only people impersonating journalists on CNN are journalists on CNN. [laughter] [At correspondents’ dinner, Hollywood’s version meets reality] ABC is here with some of the stars from their big new comedy “Black-ish.” It’s a great show, but I have to give ABC fair warning, being black-ish only makes you popular for so long. Trust me. There is a shelf life to that thing. As always, the reporters here had a lot to cover over the last year here on the East Coast. One big story was the brutal winner. The polar vortex caused so many record lows, they renamed it MSNBC. But, of course, let’s face it, there is one issue on every reporters minds, and that is 2016. Already, we’ve seen some missteps. It turns out Jeb Bush identified himself as Hispanic back in 2009, which, you know what, I — look, I understand. It’s an innocent mistake. It reminds me of when I identified myself as American back in 1961. [laughter] [applause] Ted Cruz said that denying the existence of climate change made him like Galileo. Now that’s not really an apt comparison. Galileo believed the Earth revolves around the sun. Ted Cruz believes the Earth revolves around Ted Cruz. And just as an aside, I want to point out, when a guy who has his face on a Hope poster calls you self-centered, you know you’ve got a problem. The narcissism index is creeping up a little too high. Meanwhile, Rick Santorum announced that he would not attend the same-sex wedding of a friend or loved one, to which gays and lesbians across the country responded, that’s not going to be a problem. Don’t sweat that one. [laughter] And Donald Trump is here. Still. [laughter] Anyway, it’s amazing how time flies. Soon, the first presidential contest will take place, and I for one cannot wait to see who the Koch brothers pick. It’s exciting. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, who will finally get that red rose? [laughter] The winner gets a billion dollar war chest. The runner-up gets to be the bachelor on the next season of “The Bachelor.” I mean seriously, a billion dollars from just two guys. Is it just me, or does that feel a little excessive? I mean, it’s almost insulting to the candidates. The Koch brothers think they think to spend a billion dollars to get folks to like one of these people. It’s got to hurt their feelings a little bit. And, look, I know I’ve raised a lot of money too, but in all fairness, my middle name is Hussein. What’s their excuse? [laughter] [applause] The trail hasn’t been easy for my fellow Democrats either. As we all know Hillary’s private e-mails got her in trouble. Frankly, I thought it was going to be her private Instagram account that was going to cause her bigger problems. [Shows photos of Hillary Clinton] Hillary kicked things off by going completely unrecognized at a Chipotle. Not to be outdone, Martin O’Malley went completely unrecognized as a Martin O’Malley campaign event. And Bernie Sanders might run. I like Bernie. Bernie’s an interesting guy. Apparently, some folks want to see a pot-smoking socialist in the White House. We could get a third Obama term after all. It could happen. Anyway, as always, I want to close on a more serious note. You know, I often joke about tensions between me and the press, but honestly, what they say doesn’t bother me. I understand we’ve got an adversarial system. I’m a mellow sort of guy. And that’s why I invited Luther, my anger translator, to join me here tonight. [Applause: Keegan-Michael Key joins on stage.] LUTHER: Hold on to your lily white butts! OBAMA: In our fast-changing world, traditions like the White House Correspondents’ dinner are important. LUTHER: I mean, really! What is this dinner? And why am I required to come to it? Jeb Bush, do you really want to do this! OBAMA: Because despite our differences, we count on the press to shed light on the most important issues of the day. LUTHER: And we can count on Fox News to terrify old white people with some nonsense! (inaudible) That was ridiculous. OBAMA: We won’t always see eye to eye. LUTHER: And, CNN, thank you so much for the wall-to-wall Ebola coverage. For two whole weeks, we were one step away from “The Walking Dead.” Then y’all got up and just moved on to the next day. That was awesome. Oh, and by the way, if you haven’t noticed, you don’t have Ebola! OBAMA: But I still deeply appreciate the work that you do. LUTHER: Y’all remember when I had that big old hole in the bottom of the gulf of Mexico, and then I plugged it? Remember that? Which Obama’s Katrina was that one? Was that 19 or was it 20, because I can’t remember. OBAMA: Protecting our democracy is more important than ever. For example, the Supreme Court ruled that the donor who gave Ted Cruz $6 million was just exercising free speech. LUTHER: Yes, it’s the kind of speech like this, I just wasted $6 million. OBAMA: And it’s not just Republicans. Hillary will have to raise huge sums of money too. LUTHER: Aw yeah, she’s going to get that money! She’s going to get all the money! Khaleesi is coming to Westeros! Watch out! Woo! OBAMA: The non-stop focus on billionaire donors creates real problems for our democracy. LUTHER: And that’s why we’re running for our third term! OBAMA: No, we’re not. LUTHER: We’re not? OBAMA: No. LUTHER: Who the hell said that! OBAMA: But we need to focus on big challenges like climate changes. LUTHER: Hey, folks, if you haven’t noticed, California is bone dry. It looks like a trailer for the new “Mad Max” movie up in there. Y’all think that Bradley Cooper came here because he wants to talk to Chuck Todd? He needed a glass of water! Come on. OBAMA: The science is clear, the science is clear. Nine out of the 10 hottest years ever came in the last decade. LUTHER: Now I’m not a scientist, but I do know how to count to ten. OBAMA: Rising seas, more violent storms… LUTHER: You got mosquitoes, sweaty people on the trains stinking it up. It’s just nasty! OBAMA: I mean, look at what’s happening right now. Every serious scientist says we need to act. The Pentagon says it’s a national security risk. Miami floods on a sunny day and instead of doing anything about it, we’ve got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate. LUTHER: Okay, I think they got it, bro. OBAMA: It is crazy! What about our kids? What kind of stupid, short-sided irresponsible bull — LUTHER: Whoa, whoa whoa, whoa! OBAMA: What? LUTHER: Hey! OBAMA: What! LUTHER: All due respect, sir, you don’t need anger translator. You need counseling. LUTHER: And I’m out of here, man. I ain’t trying to get into all this. OBAMA: Go. LUTHER: [to Michelle Obama] He crazy. OBAMA: Luther, my anger translator, ladies and gentlemen. [Applause] Now that I got that off my chest — you know, investigative journalism, explanatory journalism, journalism that exposes corruption and justice gives voice to the different and the marginalized, the voiceless — that’s power. It’s a privilege. It’s as important to America’s trajectory, to our values, our ideals, than anything that we could do in elected office. We remember journalists we lost over the past year. Journalists like Steven Sotloff and James Foley, murdered for nothing more than trying to shine a light into some of the world’s darkest corners. We remember the journalists unjustly imprisoned around the world, including our own Jason Rezaian. For nine months, Jason has been imprisoned in Tehran for nothing more than writing about the hopes and the fears of the Iranian people, carrying their stories to the readers of “The Washington Post,” in an effort to bridge our common humanity. As was already mentioned, Jason’s brother Ali is here tonight and I have told him personally, we will not rest until we bring him home to his family safe and sound. [Applause] These journalists and so many others view their work as more than just a profession, but as a public good, an indispensable pillar of our society, so I want to give a toast to them. I raise a glass to them and all of you, with the words of the American foreign correspondent Dorothy Thompson. It is not the fact of liberty but the way in which liberty is exercised that ultimately determines whether liberty itself survives. Thank you for your devotion to exercising our liberty and to telling our American story. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.   Read more Reliable Source: Complete coverage of the 2015 White House correspondents’ dinner Obama vows to get Post reporter freed from Iran Forget celebrity fashion: Here’s how normal guests dressed for correspondents’ dinner PHOTOS: White House correspondents’ dinner red carpet arrivals Michelle Obama’s White House correspondents’ dinner look Worlds collide at the pre-correspondents’ dinner ‘garden brunch’ A light turnout of Hollywood glitz at White House correspondents’ parties Five myths about the White House correspondents’ dinner Ethical optics remain cloudy at White House correspondents’ dinner","Good evening, everybody.

0,"In an appearance on CNN’s “Reliable Sources"" with Brian Stelter on Sunday morning, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said the paper is doing everything to free its reporter in Tehran, who has been in prison for nine months. Baron has been rallying for the release of The Post’s Tehran bureau chief Jason Rezaian, who has been charged with espionage and other crimes, including collecting classified information. “There has been no evidence provided by the Iranian government that he engaged in espionage or did anything other than report on what was happening in that country,” Baron said. “In fact, most of his coverage focused on the culture and daily life of people in Iran.” [Post reporter jailed in Iran faces 4 charges including espionage] Baron said The Post is talking to U.S. officials, who have had conversations with the Iranian government about getting Rezaian released. The paper is also pleading its case to other governments in the region and elsewhere, but Baron said there are no prospects for an imminent release. Rezaian’s imprisonment came up at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner Saturday night, with President Obama saying the government would not rest until the journalist is freed. “For nine months, Jason has been in prison in Tehran for nothing more than writing about the hopes and fears of the Iranian people,” Obama said. The president told the room full of reporters, many of whom were donning “Free Jason” pins, that he had spoken with Rezaian’s brother, Ali, who was at the dinner. “I have told him personally that I will not rest until we bring him home to his family, safe and sound,” Obama said. The president is among a growing chorus of government officials, including Secretary of State John F. Kerry, urging Iran to free Rezaian. A group of Republican senators pressed the administration to make Rezaian’s release a condition for a nuclear agreement with Iran. But the administration has been averse to tying the imprisonment with the effort to block Iran’s ability to build nuclear weapons. Rezaian, 39, has been a reporter for The Post since 2012. He and his journalist wife, Yeganeh Salehi, were arrested July 22. She was later released on bail, but Rezanian has remained in custody. The Revolutionary Court, the venue for national security cases, took up the couple's cases. Although the court has never publicly disclosed the charges against Rezaian, his attorney has said that the charges stem from inquiries and contacts he made as a journalist. Asked about the motivation for the arrest, Baron said, “There has been plenty of speculation that there is some sort of conflict between the Revolutionary Guard and the government of President Rouhani and his foreign ministers, but we don’t know that for sure. We’re not in a position to speculate. We’re mystified by it.” No date has been set for the trial, but Rezaian’s attorney has said that it may begin in the next few weeks. A judge known for imposing harsh sentences, including the death penalty for anti-government protesters, is slated to hear the case. [Hard-line judge in Iran is assigned case of jailed Post reporter Jason Rezaian] “It’s a terrifying situation and an entirely unjust situation,” Baron said of Rezaian’s imprisonment. “There is absolutely no justification for this happening.” Baron said Rezaian has been held longer than any other journalist in Iran. The reporter has spent much of the nine months in isolation, where he has suffered health problems and bouts of depression. Baron said Rezaian has been denied the treatment he needs and was granted time to meet with his attorney only in the past week, for 90 minutes. “That is not a system of justice. That is a system of officially sanctioned injustice. And not a shred of evidence has been provided that he has done anything wrong,” Baron said.","In an appearance on CNN’s “Reliable Sources"" with Brian Stelter on Sunday morning, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said the paper is doing everything to free its reporter in Tehran, who has been in prison for nine months. Baron has been rallying for the release of The Post’s Tehran bureau chief Jason Rezaian, who has been charged with espionage and other crimes, including collecting classified information. “There has been no evidence provided by the Iranian government that he engaged in espionage or did anything other than report on what was happening in that country,” Baron said. “In fact, most of his coverage focused on the culture and daily life of people in Iran.” [Post reporter jailed in Iran faces 4 charges including espionage] Baron said The Post is talking to U.S. officials, who have had conversations with the Iranian government about getting Rezaian released. The paper is also pleading its case to other governments in the region and elsewhere, but Baron said there are no prospects for an imminent release. Rezaian’s imprisonment came up at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner Saturday night, with President Obama saying the government would not rest until the journalist is freed. “For nine months, Jason has been in prison in Tehran for nothing more than writing about the hopes and fears of the Iranian people,” Obama said. The president told the room full of reporters, many of whom were donning “Free Jason” pins, that he had spoken with Rezaian’s brother, Ali, who was at the dinner. “I have told him personally that I will not rest until we bring him home to his family, safe and sound,” Obama said.

0,"Statement from Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post: The news of a trial date in Iran’s contemptible prosecution of The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian should leave no doubt as to what is at stake. The serious criminal charges that Jason now faces in Iran’s Revolutionary Court are not supported by a single fact. The proceedings against him have been anything but fair and open – if they had been, Jason would never have been subjected to outrageous prison conditions, obstacles to selecting a lawyer, limited time to prepare a defense, and an inadequate window on the case that Iran plans to bring against him. The absence of evidence against him should have led to dismissal of the case long ago. Iran has already held Jason unjustly for 300 days that have included long periods of solitary confinement and severe interrogation. He has been permitted to meet only once with his lawyer, Leila Ahsan, to prepare for the trial, and only in the presence of official translators. Against this backdrop of injustice, Iran must now belatedly demonstrate that it can act with openness and fairness. The world will be watching, and we call on Iran to make these proceedings public and transparent. In order to support Jason and his family, The Washington Post is seeking to secure an Iranian visa that would allow a senior editor to be present throughout the trial in Iran. We are hoping for a positive response, after many months in which previous requests have gone unanswered. Any just proceeding would quickly acquit Jason and his wife Yeganeh Salehi of all allegations and grant them their freedom.","Statement from Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post: The news of a trial date in Iran’s contemptible prosecution of The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian should leave no doubt as to what is at stake.

Now we learn his trial will be closed to the world. And so it will be closed to the scrutiny it fully deserves. It’s worth recalling what kind of system we’re dealing with. Jason was arrested without charges. He was imprisoned in Iran’s worst prison. He was placed in isolation for many months and denied medical care he needed. His case was assigned to a judge internationally notorious for human rights violations. He could not select the lawyer of his choosing. He was given only an hour and a half to meet with a lawyer approved by the court. No evidence has ever been produced by prosecutors or the court to support these absurd charges. The trial date was only disclosed to Jason’s lawyer last week. And now, unsurprisingly but unforgivably, it turns out the trial will be closed. Jason’s mother, Mary, who has spent the last two weeks in Iran awaiting the trial, will not be permitted to attend. His wife, Yeganeh, who faces related charges, will also be barred; she is to be tried separately. Efforts by The Washington Post to secure a visa that would have allowed a senior editor to travel to Iran have gone unanswered by the authorities in Tehran. There is no justice in this system, not an ounce of it, and yet the fate of a good, innocent man hangs in the balance.

0,"As we have noted, President Obama’s notion that a revolutionary Islamic, virulently anti-Semitic regime can nevertheless be rational or is “moderating” is wrong-headed and dangerous.  More evidence arises each day that the ideological nature of the regime defines its behavior and poses an insuperable barrier to getting Obama’s “good deal.” Take its human rights conduct, and specifically the trial of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. In response to Iran’s announcement that it will try Rezaian in secret, The Post’s executive editor Martin Baron enumerated the Kafkaesque treatment Rezaian has been subjected to: It’s worth recalling what kind of system we’re dealing with.

There is no justice in this system, not an ounce of it, and yet the fate of a good, innocent man hangs in the balance. Iran is making a statement about its values in its disgraceful treatment of our colleague, and it can only horrify the world community. Why would a regime behave in such a capricious manner, one destined to sow distrust in the West and make it even more difficult to rejoin the “international community”? The obvious answer is that its totalitarian fervor shapes its power structure and determines its behavior. The furtherance of its revolutionary ideals ranks far above economic health and international acceptance as a national priority. We have seen that Iran will in fact act in ways contrary to its economic and diplomatic interests when it suits its ideological goals. Indeed its worsening human right picture in general belies the notion that the regime acts rationally, as opposed to ideologically, or that it is changing its outlook. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom documents the continuing deterioration of human rights in Iran, which is rates among the worst of the worst. A sample: Since President Hassan Rouhani assumed office in August 2013, the number of individuals from religious minority communities who are in prison because of their beliefs has increased. The government of Iran continues to engage in systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom, including prolonged detention, torture, and executions based primarily or entirely upon the religion of the accused.  . . .  Since his June 2013 election, President Hassan Rouhani has not delivered on his campaign promises to strengthen civil liberties for religious minorities. Physical attacks, harassment, detention, arrests, and imprisonment continued. Even some of the constitutionally-recognized non-Muslim minorities – Jews, Armenian and Assyrian Christians, and Zoroastrians – face harassment, intimidation, discrimination, arrests, and imprisonment. Some majority Shi’a and minority Sunni Muslims, including clerics who dissent, were intimidated, harassed, and detained. Dissidents and human rights defenders were increasingly subject to abuse and several were sentenced to death and even executed for the capital crime of “enmity against God.” In short, Obama relies on a fiction — Iran is rational or moderating — because a revolutionary, apocalyptic regime will of course defy any agreement, cheat, pursue its nuclear program and use the deal to gain cover for its terrorist activities. Sanctions relief will go to support the regime, intensify its grip and reduce any inclination to  behave like a normal, civilized nation. Sanctions relief over the last 18 months or so has not moderated Iran’s conduct; it has made it more defiant and aggressive. At some level the president understands this, as evidenced by his recognition that sanctions  — not economic engagement — forced Iran to come to the table. Now, however, when his “legacy” is at stake his analysis flips and he insists that giving Iran what it wants (e.g. sanctions relief) will lead to better behavior. Iran wanted to segregate discussion of human rights from nuclear talks because it is unwilling to address the former. The president was only too happy to acomodate because focus on the former raises considerable doubt the latter can ever be successful. It serves both their interests to pretend Iran’s internal conduct has no implications for Iran’s international and nuclear ambitions. William Russell Mead concludes there is a real question as to “whether President Obama has fully considered the possibility that his counterparts in Iran don’t see the same world that he does, that they don’t think political cause and effect works the same way that he thinks it does and that they see him, for example, less as an independent actor proceeding on the basis of rational convictions and humanitarian good will than as a mask for the real American overlords, the evil Waspo-Jewish conspiracy that in the demonology of Iranian revolutionary thought controls the United States and is driving the world to destruction.” This is not merely an academic matter: The problem here is that the President, ironically enough, doesn’t seem to understand diversity. He thinks diversity is trivial: that people of different religious faiths, ethnic backgrounds and ideological convictions are not all that different in the way they look at the world. The President’s life experiences have taught him that diversity is superficially important but on the big issues it matters much less. Rulers of great nations, in particular, can’t afford to let their backgrounds and their religious ideas get in the way of clear thinking and planning.  . . . President Obama’s answer will deepen the concern among his critics that he has learned nothing from his encounters with Putin and Erdogan, and continues to think that his opponents see the world more or less as President Obama does. So long as we pretend Iran is something it is not and so long as we ignore the link between its domestic repression and international goals (both serve the cause of Islamic radicalism) we will not alter Iran’s behavior. Indeed, as we have seen from the past few years, our willful blindness causes Iran to intensify domestic repression and international aggression.","As we have noted, President Obama’s notion that a revolutionary Islamic, virulently anti-Semitic regime can nevertheless be rational or is “moderating” is wrong-headed and dangerous.  More evidence arises each day that the ideological nature of the regime defines its behavior and poses an insuperable barrier to getting Obama’s “good deal.” Take its human rights conduct, and specifically the trial of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian.

0,"TOMORROW, the onetime “hard” deadline for a final U.S. accord on Iran’s nuclear program may well come and go without a deal being done. As Iran’s head nuclear negotiator has flown back to Tehran to huddle with the home team, the pause in the action has highlighted the extreme political sensitivity to world perception that these talks are operating under. And as this entire delicate drama plays out, I can’t help but wonder as one personal side note: If Secretary of State John Kerry and his team can somehow pull off this immense deal, how does that bode, too, for one individual, legal case that Kerry has pursued? What, in other words, would that mean for Jason? Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post correspondent in Iran who has dual citizenship, has been jailed for nearly a year — precisely, 342 days, mostly at Tehran’s infamous Evin Prison. And so, as Comic Riffs does every month, we visually count down the days of injustice by updating our Rezaian illustration. Last month, Jason finally saw Day 1 of a trial, closed and without transparency, and was charged with being a spy and disseminating propaganda against the “establishment” of Iran. (One piece of reported “evidence” against him: A 2008 online job application to the Obama administration that went nowhere.) As it urges for Rezaian’s release, Kerry’s State Department has called the legal action against him “absurd.” Now as it happens, the Revolutionary Court judge hearing Rezaian’s case is also the same jurist who several weeks ago sentenced Iranian artist Atena Farghadani to a 12-year-plus sentence for her cartoons and activism. The 29-year-old was arrested last August after drawing members of Parliament as cows and monkeys, to satirize their votes against birth control, and after being jailed for several months, was re-arrested this past January. Then, earlier this month, Farghadani’s attorney, Mohammad Moghimi, was arrested and jailed when he and his cartoonist client shook hands — which, since the two aren’t related, authorities say constitutes fornication or adultery. Moghimi was preparing Farghadani’s appeal of her sentence. And so Comic Riffs continues our Jason Rezaian series of illustrations, as we also continue to point to our open letter and “Wise up” cartoon (after Atena’s original) to launch the now-global #Draw4Atena campaign. The goal is not simply to draw out of a sense of injustice. The true aim is to draw attention. Line by line, voice by voice. Because who knows what a deal with Iran may bring?","TOMORROW, the onetime “hard” deadline for a final U.S. accord on Iran’s nuclear program may well come and go without a deal being done.

Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post correspondent in Iran who has dual citizenship, has been jailed for nearly a year — precisely, 342 days, mostly at Tehran’s infamous Evin Prison. And so, as Comic Riffs does every month, we visually count down the days of injustice by updating our Rezaian illustration. Last month, Jason finally saw Day 1 of a trial, closed and without transparency, and was charged with being a spy and disseminating propaganda against the “establishment” of Iran. (One piece of reported “evidence” against him: A 2008 online job application to the Obama administration that went nowhere.) As it urges for Rezaian’s release, Kerry’s State Department has called the legal action against him “absurd.” Now as it happens, the Revolutionary Court judge hearing Rezaian’s case is also the same jurist who several weeks ago sentenced Iranian artist Atena Farghadani to a 12-year-plus sentence for her cartoons and activism. The 29-year-old was arrested last August after drawing members of Parliament as cows and monkeys, to satirize their votes against birth control, and after being jailed for several months, was re-arrested this past January. Then, earlier this month, Farghadani’s attorney, Mohammad Moghimi, was arrested and jailed when he and his cartoonist client shook hands — which, since the two aren’t related, authorities say constitutes fornication or adultery. Moghimi was preparing Farghadani’s appeal of her sentence. And so Comic Riffs continues our Jason Rezaian series of illustrations, as we also continue to point to our open letter and “Wise up” cartoon (after Atena’s original) to launch the now-global #Draw4Atena campaign. The goal is not simply to draw out of a sense of injustice. The true aim is to draw attention. Line by line, voice by voice. Because who knows what a deal with Iran may bring?"
1,"Statement from Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post: “Jason Rezaian’s unjust detention on espionage and other charges trumped up by Iranian authorities has now, almost inconceivably, stretched into nearly a full year. Until today, Jason’s so-called trial, a secret proceeding that began with a single short hearing in May and a second in June, had been halted for more than a month. A third hearing in Jason’s case was held today, without conclusion, Jason’s lawyer has told his family. No date has yet been set for these proceedings to resume. We call again on Iran to deliver a speedy, fair and impartial judgment in Jason’s case, one that could only result in his acquittal, immediate release, and a long-overdue reunion with his family. It is long past time to bring an end to the nightmare that began on July 22, 2014, when Jason – The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent — and his wife Yeganeh Salehi, both accredited as journalists by the Government of Iran, were arrested by Iranian authorities.”","Statement from Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post: “Jason Rezaian’s unjust detention on espionage and other charges trumped up by Iranian authorities has now, almost inconceivably, stretched into nearly a full year.

After news of the nuclear deal, Jason Rezaian’s brother and The Washington Post’s executive editor renewed calls for the release of Rezaian, The Post’s Tehran bureau chief, who is facing trial on charges that include espionage. Rezaian has strongly denied the allegations. “The outcome of the nuclear deal does not change Jason’s cruel and illegal imprisonment for the past 356 days,” his brother, Ali Rezaian, said in a statement Tuesday. He added: “We are hopeful that with agreement now in place the Iranian courts will conclude this process swiftly and affirm Jason’s innocence so we can bring him home and make our family whole once again.” In a separate statement, Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post, called on Iran to “deliver a fair and impartial judgment in Jason’s case, one that could only result in his acquittal and immediate release.” “It is important to remember that Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent, remains in an Iranian prison despite the international accord announced Tuesday on Iran’s nuclear program,” Baron said. At a White House news conference Wednesday, Obama was asked by CBS News correspondent Major Garrett: “Can you tell the country, sir, why you are content with all the fanfare around this deal to leave the conscience of this nation, the strength of this nation, unaccounted for in relation to these four Americans?” The president responded: “The notion that I am content, as I celebrate with American citizens languishing in Iranian jails — Major, that’s nonsense. And you should know better. I’ve met with the families of some of those folks; nobody’s content.” Obama added that “our diplomats, our teams, are working diligently to try to get them out.” Rezaian’s third court hearing was held Monday in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court, his attorney told The Post. The lawyer, Leila Ahsan, is barred by Iranian authorities from giving further details about the closed-door session, but she told the journalist’s family that “Jason was in good spirits and answered some questions about the charges.” In his statement Tuesday, Ali Rezaian said: “Jason is completely innocent of all charges and it is inhumane for him to still be held behind bars after nearly a year. He was a journalist doing his job and today he should be reporting on the details of this agreement rather than being subjected to continued incarceration and delays in the judicial proceedings.” The family remains “appreciative” of the U.S. government’s ongoing efforts on “behalf of Jason and the other Americans being held in Iran,” Ali Rezaian said. No date has been set for Jason Rezaian’s next hearing. He is charged with espionage and distributing propaganda against the Islamic republic. Rezaian, his Iranian wife and two photojournalists were detained July 22, 2014, in Tehran. His wife, Yeganeh Salehi, a correspondent for the National newspaper in Abu Dhabi, was later released on bail. One of the photojournalists also faces charges related to the case. The claims against Rezaian, 39, appear to include a visit he made to a U.S. consulate seeking a visa for his wife and a letter he wrote seeking a job in the Obama administration in 2008 — material that was apparently taken from his confiscated laptop. Secretary of State John F. Kerry has hinted that the nuclear deal, which will not go into effect until it is verified that Iran has met its terms, could lead to broader contacts between the United States and Iran. The two countries have had no direct diplomatic relations since April 1980, when ties were severed as a result of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by militants supporting the 1979 Islamic revolution. “Confidence is never built overnight. It has to be built over time,” Kerry said in Vienna just hours after the nuclear accord was reached. In addition to Rezaian, at least two other Americans are being held in Iran: Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor imprisoned there for conducting Bible studies, and Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine accused of spying. Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent, disappeared in Iran in 2007, but his whereabouts are not clear.

1,"Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, reiterated his call for the release of correspondent Jason Rezaian, whose arrest and year-long detention in Iran drew fresh attention with the country’s nuclear agreement with the United States and other world powers last week. Baron, appearing Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” declined to say whether the fate of Rezaian and other Americans being held by Iran should have been tied to the deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program. But he said he took the Obama administration at its word that it is continuing to work for Rezaian’s release. “We hope that’s the case . . . and we want them to work harder,” Baron said, adding that The Post also has been working to secure Rezaian’s release. “We’ve tried every channel we can think of — through other governments, through individuals, through the administration — you name it.

It was last July 22 that Rezaian, The Post’s Tehran correspondent, was detained, as was his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, an Iranian journalist who was released on bail. But for the 39-year-old Post reporter, who has dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, justice remains detained as he marks Day 364 behind bars, as well as behind the scrim of an opaque legal system. Rezaian has been charged with espionage, and faces other claims related to spying, his lawyer has said, and he could face 10 to 20 years in prison if convicted. Post Executive Editor Martin Baron has called the allegations “grave” but also “ludicrous.” And so month by month, I cross these lines of stolen time, even as I talk with an Iranian American acquaintance who tells me that he fears Rezaian is a pawn amid larger geopolitics.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists seeks legal intervention and says that it’s time.

1,"The Washington Post has filed an urgent action petition with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention asserting numerous violations of international law and seeking the immediate release of Post Tehran correspondent Jason Rezaian. Rezaian was arrested on July 22, 2014 and has been detained in Iran’s notorious Evin Prison for the last year. For months, Rezaian was held without formal charges and without access to counsel. He has been subjected to harsh interrogation and months of solitary confinement. Washington Post Publisher Frederick J.

For the past year, Jason has endured extensive physical mistreatment and psychological abuse, and we are deeply concerned for his welfare. Jason is being deprived of his basic human rights, and we are asking the U.N. Working Group to render an opinion to Iran and the international community that Jason’s detention is unlawful and that he should be released immediately.” The petition, which was announced during a press conference this morning (see video) at the National Press Club, asserts that Rezaian’s detention is arbitrary and unlawful under both Iranian and international law, and includes a formal request for “Urgent Action” by the Working Group, a step which is available in cases where continued detention may constitute a serious danger to an individual’s health or safety. Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron spoke at the press conference and stated, “Every aspect of this case — his incarceration, his trial, the conditions of his imprisonment — has been a disgraceful violation of human rights. And it violates common decency.” The UNWGAD is a United Nations entity, composed of five independent experts, that focuses on the problem of unlawful detentions. It reports to the U.N.

And it violates common decency.” The UNWGAD is a United Nations entity, composed of five independent experts, that focuses on the problem of unlawful detentions. It reports to the U.N. Human Rights Council and is the only non-treaty-based, international mechanism with a mandate to consider individual complaints against States.

0,"A panel appointed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has voted to raise the minimum wage across the state to $15 an hour over the next several years, but only for the fast-food industry. Restaurateurs, along with workers earning near the minimum wage in other sectors, feel they're being treated unfairly, reports Patrick McGeehan in The New York Times: “We continue to say that we think it’s unfair that they singled out a single segment of our industry,” Melissa Fleischut, the executive director of the New York State Restaurant Association, said. ... Already on Wednesday afternoon, some retail workers in Manhattan were wondering, what about us? “We deserve it, too,” said Mary Gomes, 51, who works at a Duane Reade drugstore, where she said she earned $9.20 per hour. As Lydia DePillis writes at Wonkblog, the increase will probably force employers in other sectors to raise their wages as well, or else their workers will abandon them for the fast-food industry, and a higher minimum across the board is still a possibility. However you feel about the minimum wage in general, it's hard to think up any economic rationale for increasing it in just one type of business. Welcome to Wonkbook.

0,"Republican opponents of the Iran deal are urging their colleagues to oppose it, arguing that the next president – even if it’s a Democrat – will be able to secure a better deal than President Obama. On Thursday, two Republican 2016 contenders got to tip their hand at just what they’d do about Iran’s nuclear ambitions if they had a White House perch. They spoke during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing to grill Secretary of State John Kerry, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew on Iran. Kerry and his colleagues haven’t been very successful drawing support for the deal in their first 24 hours pressing their case on Capitol Hill. But Thursday’s exchanges ended with Kerry more or less shutting down a line of argument from each GOP hopeful. [Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post’s new political tipsheet] Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) went first, and struck an assertive tone, telling Obama’s Cabinet members that the next president – hint hint – would be within his or her rights to rip up the whole agreement. “It’s important for the world and especially Iran to understand that this is a deal whose survival is not guaranteed beyond the term of the current president,” Rubio said – taking care not to refer to himself by pronoun or name – and reminded administration officials that even they didn’t expect a majority of Congress to back the deal. “Even if this deal narrowly avoids congressional defeat, the Iranian regime and world should know this deal is your deal with Iran, meaning yours — this administration — and the next president is under no legal or moral obligation to live up to it,” Rubio went on. “The deal can go away the day president Obama leaves office.” With that much established, the Florida senator moved to lay a prime political trap for the Cabinet secretaries, asking if the “cooperation” provisions would compel the United States to protect Iran’s nuclear program against any sabotage attempts by Israel and other countries. “No,” Moniz answered flatly. So did Kerry. “That’s not how I read this,” Rubio replied. And Kerry, seizing the break in Rubio’s argument, took control of the conversation. “I listened to a long list of your objections here about [the deal], but there’s no alternative that you or anybody else has proposed,” Kerry said, disregarding Rubio’s attempt to interject. “And I am confident that the next president of the United States will have enough common sense that if this is being applied properly, if it’s being implemented fully, they’re not just going to arbitrarily end it,” Kerry continued. “If you think the ayatollah’s going to come back and negotiate again with an American, that’s fantasy. You’re never going to see that because we will have proven we’re not trustworthy.” Rubio never really got more than another few words in edgewise. [Secret deals become latest congressional complaint on Iran deal] When the roster rolled around to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) a few hours later, he tried a more diplomatic approach. “I continue to support a negotiated solution and think it preferable to war,” Paul began, before asking the main question he would try to drive home during his allotted time: “Will it stop them from having a nuclear weapon?” “The ayatollah is saying the opposite,” Paul said. “That troubles us.” “He’s protecting his domestic turf,” Kerry answered – not satisfying Paul, who again pressed Kerry to explain why the U.S. claimed the deal would stop Iran from procuring a nuclear weapon, when Iran’s Supreme Leader appeared to be claiming that was not the case. “I want a negotiated settlement, I want to believe we have an agreement,” Paul said, doubling down on his diplomatic stance. But after almost four hours of testimony, Kerry apparently wasn’t feeling as diplomatic – telling Paul bluntly that he clearly misread what Iran’s Supreme Leader said. “You know why he’s saying that? Because he doesn’t believe the Americans stopped them, he believes he stopped them because he issued a fatwa,” Kerry said. “So he is as a matter of sovereignty and pride making a true statement — he’s not saying the Americans stopped them [from procuring a weapon], he’s saying he didn’t want one in the first place.” Paul ended the conversation then. The exchanges with Kerry are unlikely to affect how Paul and Rubio – or most other Republicans, for that matter — will vote. But since Iran will certainly occupy a place in the political dialogue during the 2016 season, their experience Thursday isn’t for naught. Each has now publicly gone toe-to-toe with the chief U.S. negotiator of the Iran deal that Republicans revile – who happens to have once been a presidential candidate himself. So at least Rubio and Paul can consider it practice for the debates, should they get past the primaries.","Republican opponents of the Iran deal are urging their colleagues to oppose it, arguing that the next president – even if it’s a Democrat – will be able to secure a better deal than President Obama.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) a few hours later, he tried a more diplomatic approach. “I continue to support a negotiated solution and think it preferable to war,” Paul began, before asking the main question he would try to drive home during his allotted time: “Will it stop them from having a nuclear weapon?” “The ayatollah is saying the opposite,” Paul said. “That troubles us.” “He’s protecting his domestic turf,” Kerry answered – not satisfying Paul, who again pressed Kerry to explain why the U.S. claimed the deal would stop Iran from procuring a nuclear weapon, when Iran’s Supreme Leader appeared to be claiming that was not the case. “I want a negotiated settlement, I want to believe we have an agreement,” Paul said, doubling down on his diplomatic stance. But after almost four hours of testimony, Kerry apparently wasn’t feeling as diplomatic – telling Paul bluntly that he clearly misread what Iran’s Supreme Leader said. “You know why he’s saying that? Because he doesn’t believe the Americans stopped them, he believes he stopped them because he issued a fatwa,” Kerry said. “So he is as a matter of sovereignty and pride making a true statement — he’s not saying the Americans stopped them [from procuring a weapon], he’s saying he didn’t want one in the first place.” Paul ended the conversation then. The exchanges with Kerry are unlikely to affect how Paul and Rubio – or most other Republicans, for that matter — will vote. But since Iran will certainly occupy a place in the political dialogue during the 2016 season, their experience Thursday isn’t for naught. Each has now publicly gone toe-to-toe with the chief U.S. negotiator of the Iran deal that Republicans revile – who happens to have once been a presidential candidate himself. So at least Rubio and Paul can consider it practice for the debates, should they get past the primaries."

Jason’s lawyer, Leila Ahsan, has been told that closed-door proceedings will resume on Monday in Iran’s Revolutionary Court, and that this will be the final hearing before a verdict is reached. This is a critical moment. Iran has behaved unconscionably throughout this travesty of a case. It has imprisoned an innocent journalist for more than a year and subjected him to physical mistreatment and psychological abuse. The secret court proceedings that began on May 25 have been a farce, with just three hearings over a 10-week period, without evidence of wrongdoing, and without even a hint of basic due process. The allegations of grave crimes, including espionage, that have been brought against Jason could not be more baseless and absurd. We call again on Iran’s Revolutionary Court, even at this late date, to demonstrate fairness and justice that could only result in Jason’s acquittal and immediate release. The end of this “judicial process” presents Iran with an opportunity to bring this nightmare to a long-overdue and humane resolution, by exonerating Jason and his wife, Yeganeh, and allowing them the freedom that is their right.","Statement by Martin Baron, executive editor, The Washington Post: The sham trial of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post’s correspondent in Tehran, may now finally be nearing its end.

Washington 
Post’s correspondent in Tehran, Jason Rezaian, who now awaits verdict after his fourth and possible final hearing earlier this week. “The arrest, detention and secret trial of Mr. Rezaian violate his rights and intimidate all those working in the media in Iran,” said the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, David Kaye. “His continued detention violates basic rules that not only aim to protect journalists, bloggers, human rights activists and others but to guarantee everyone’s right to information.” Iranian authorities detained Mr. Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, over a year ago, though she was subsequently released. In secret proceedings, he has reportedly been accused of espionage, collaboration with hostile governments, gathering classified information and disseminating propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran. “Mr. Rezaian seems to have been detained for the simple fact of having exercised his rights to freedom of expression, association and political participation,” said human rights expert Seong-Phil Hong, who currently heads the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. “His rights to legal counsel of his choice and to due process of law seem to have been forgotten.” Mr. Rezaian’s trial has been held closed to the public and even his close relatives. He has had no opportunity to present witnesses or evidence in his defense, or to examine and challenge witnesses and evidence against him. Mr. Rezaian has also been deprived of his right to consular visitation. The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, reminded the Iranian Government of its responsibility to ensure that journalists do not face prosecution for exercising their professional activities. “Mr. Rezaian’s case is part of a broader crackdown on freedom of expression in Iran. Journalists must be protected, not harassed, detained or prosecuted,” he stressed. The UN experts noted that Mr. Rezaian, who is being held at Evin Prison in Tehran, was placed in solitary confinement for five months and subjected to full-day interrogation sessions that caused significant physical and psychological strain. The conditions at Evin Prison have resulted in Rezaian’s dramatic weight loss, respiratory problems, and chronic infections. “He has suffered unlawful treatment during his year-long incarceration,” Mr. Hong highlighted. “We urge the Iranian Government to release Mr. Rezaian as well as all those exercising their rights to expression who have been arbitrarily arrested, detained and prosecuted,” the human rights experts said. The Special Rapporteurs and Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

1,"Statement from Martin Baron, executive editor, The Washington Post: In urging the immediate release of The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian, an authoritative group of independent experts from the United Nations has sounded a powerful call for the government of Iran to uphold its international legal obligations in a case that has been anything but just. This call by three U.N. human rights experts comes at a critical moment, with Jason facing a verdict any day in Iran’s Revolutionary Court on nonsensical and unsupportable charges that include espionage. The statement upholds our view that Iran’s conduct in this contemptible case has violated international law, Iran’s own laws, and fundamental human decency. This is a call that Iran must heed. The experts, including the current head of the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, are independent, highly-regarded specialists from a variety of countries appointed by the United Nations to play leading roles on issues involving the freedom of opinion and expression, arbitrary detention and on human rights in Iran. A 
petition submitted 
by The Washington Post last month to the U.N. Working Group sought ‘’urgent action’’ in confronting Iran over its handling of the case. It is heartening to see these experts fulfilling their respective mandates in service to the United Nations – and the entire international community – by holding Iran to account for its violations of international law and its unlawful imprisonment of Jason Rezaian. Our hope is that the Working Group will soon take further action in response to our petition and issue a separate urgent appeal to Iran to afford Jason Rezaian his most basic rights and freedoms under binding international law, and demand that Iran immediately release him. Jason’s arrest, imprisonment, and the sham trial that concluded on Monday have denied him due process and personal dignity. He was arrested without cause, subjected to physical mistreatment and psychological abuse, and held for months without charges, without access to a lawyer. In recent weeks, his treatment has worsened. The one thing that is clear is Jason’s innocence. Against the backdrop of an impending verdict in so abominable a case, this important statement by the United Nations’ human rights experts, including the chair of the U.N.

0,"Dozens of prominent Iranian activists, both living at home and overseas, have in recent days expressed their support for the successful passage of a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, and urged lawmakers in Washington not to thwart the work of many months of concerted diplomacy. The above videos were posted last week on Facebook accounts belonging to two Iranian political activists, Mohammadreza Jalaeipour and Farrokh Negahdar. They've been joined now by many other voices, some in exile and others even still in jail. The lengthy roster of testimonies includes Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, acclaimed filmmaker Jafar Panahi, women's rights activist Ghoncheh Ghavami, and Zia Nabavi, a student activist who is still serving a 10-year-sentence in an Iranian prison. Jalaeipour, currently a PhD candidate in sociology at Oxford University, spent five months in solitary confinement in Tehran's infamous Evin prison for his involvement in the 2009 protests that followed the controversial reelection of former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Yet Jalaeipour is one of the organizers of the current campaign, which uses the online hashtag #SupportIranDeal. While he wants to see political change in his country and is deeply critical of the Iranian regime's human rights record, he reckons rapprochement with the West is key for progress at home. ""I believe the only effective route to promotion of democracy and prosperity in Iran is gradual internal reform,"" Jalaeipour wrote in an e-mail to WorldViews. ""A final deal is a victory for the Iranian people whose lives will be directly improved and who can also begin working for other positive changes."" The extensive accumulation of testimonies serves somewhat as a riposte to a letter from a group of Iranian dissidents published in the Daily Beast earlier this month, which warned of the dangers of reaching compromise with the Islamic Republic and decried ""Western apologists and appeasers of Iranian theocracy."" But a majority of ordinary citizens of Iran appear to back the deal. Moreover, as Negar Mortazavi, an Iranian-American journalist and an organizer in favor of the deal, points out, thousands of Iranians living overseas have gathered in various cities across the world in rallies calling for the deal's passage. She says the deal's opponents in the Iranian diaspora are a minority, some of whom are connected to certain pressure groups in Western capitals. ""They can't even bring 200 people to the streets,"" she tells WorldViews. A popular theme among the testimonies was the need to drop crippling sanctions on Iran's economy, which have significantly affected the lives of many ordinary Iranians. ""I do not agree with those who assume that imposing sanctions can lead to the improvement of the human rights situation in Iran as I do not believe that the right for a secure and prosperous life can be separated from human rights,"" said Nabavi, jailed since 2009 on charges of ""creating unease in the public mind"" for his involvement in the 2009 protests. Nabavi delivered his testimony over the phone, which you can hear in the video immediately above. ""I therefore hope that American citizens, like the majority of Iranian citizens, will reach out to their representatives in Congress and ask them to support this deal and to give dialogue and diplomacy a chance for success,"" he said. In 2010, filmmaker Panahi was given a jail sentence and also banned from making  movies for 20 years by the regime. The ruling has not stopped him, though. His recent film, ""Taxi,"" won the Golden Bear in the Berlin Film Festival this year. ""I work with imagination, but not imagination alone; imagination immersed in reality,"" says Panahi in his recorded video, calling on American politicians to recognize the merits of diplomacy with Iran. ""What is happening in U.S. Congress and among American policy makers is mere imagination with no sense of reality. They think or they imagine that with sanctions and war, things can be accomplished. This is not the reality of my country."" Farrokh Negahdar, a prominent Iranian leftist and secularist, spent a decade in prison during the reign of Iran's Shah, and was eventually compelled to flee his country in the early years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and has never returned. But, as his video in the beginning of this article attests, he is a keen supporter of the deal. ""If you want a better world, you have to narrow down the gaps, rather than widen them,"" he told WorldViews in a phone interview from London. ""This deal narrows the gap between Iran and the rest of the world."" That's important, Neghadar argues, because it will likely rein in Iran's more hard-line groups. ""The right-wing repressive forces within the government have tried to link the democratic movement of Iran to puppets of the United States and Israel,"" he says. ""If there were better relations between Iran and the West, and the threat diminished, then the position of right-wing forces within the government would be weaker."" In her own testimony, Nasrin Sotoudeh, a leading lawyer and human rights activist within Iran, concurs. ""As an Iranian, I criticize the extremist rhetoric of the Iranian hard-liners and I ask my politicians to stop the threatening and militarist language,"" she says. ""Likewise, I call on Americans overseas to urge their representatives in Congress to refrain from using the language of threat."" Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel laureate, echoes a White House talking point in her testimony. ""I support the Iran deal because, as the U.S. President said, 'the alternative is war',"" she says, ""and war is not in the interest of Iran, the Middle East and the world.""

0,"The Post reports: Senate Democrats on Tuesday blocked a second Republican attempt to pass a resolution disapproving of the Iran nuclear deal. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is hardly giving up the fight, moving to schedule a Thursday vote on rolling back sanctions on Iran until the Islamic Republic recognizes Israel’s right to exist and releases American prisoners being held in the country. That set includes The Washington Post’s Iran correspondent, Jason Rezaian. It’s a tactic aimed at forcing an up-or-down vote on the nuclear pact and getting Democrats directly on the record supporting what Republicans hope will be politically unpopular. The deadline for congressional action on the deal is Thursday — Sept. 17. Some suggest the “nuclear option” — i.e. doing away with the filibuster — but even if advisable it would not get the Senate to 67 votes to override. And remember the House decided not to vote under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (instead taking a vote outside the Cardin-Corker legislative scheme) so there would be little point. That does not mean Congress is entirely powerless either to improve our position now or to help the next president pull the plug on the deal. Sanctions guru Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies suggests Congress designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization. He explains as a practical matter this would mean that “any company doing business in Iran with the IRGC would be doing business with a terrorism organization.” Even the degree to which the IRGC has infiltrated the Iranian economy, this would act as a backstop once sanctions are lifted, slowing the Iranian economy’s recovery. Alternatively (or in addition) Dubowitz recommends “Congressional sanctions that would automatically snap back if Iran is found in violation of any provision of the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action].” In any event, he urges, “Legislation should also establish a congressional commission to oversee the enforcement of [the Iran deal] with permanent staff with appropriate clearances.” Other critics of the president’s Iran appeasement suggest passage of new sanctions to address human rights violations, support for terrorism and/or for the Syrian regime and for continued detention of Americans. This could be every bit as stringent as the sanctions President Obama is lifting by executive waiver. Congress could also vote to supply Israel with bunker-buster bombs (increasing its military option) or an authorization for use of force in the event Iran violates the deal, a finding Congress could make itself. And Congress could vote to void the deal in the event Iran does not satisfy the allow inspection of military bases or disclose the possible military dimensions of its program. It is not clear the president would agree to any of these, for fear of upsetting Tehran or violating the deal, which seems to inhibit any U.S. sanctions against Iran whatsoever (even for non-nuclear activities). However, on some of these a veto-proof majority might be possible, especially given the tremendous criticism raining down on Democrats who decided to filibuster a vote on the deal itself. The votes also place both Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidate in a tight spot.

It would behoove House and Senate leaders to chart a course forward with specific measures and a definite timetable for taking votes. Moving from symbolic votes on the deal itself to meaningful measures to pressure Iran and/or end the deal is a necessity.","The Post reports: Senate Democrats on Tuesday blocked a second Republican attempt to pass a resolution disapproving of the Iran nuclear deal. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is hardly giving up the fight, moving to schedule a Thursday vote on rolling back sanctions on Iran until the Islamic Republic recognizes Israel’s right to exist and releases American prisoners being held in the country. That set includes The Washington Post’s Iran correspondent, Jason Rezaian. It’s a tactic aimed at forcing an up-or-down vote on the nuclear pact and getting Democrats directly on the record supporting what Republicans hope will be politically unpopular. The deadline for congressional action on the deal is Thursday — Sept. 17. Some suggest the “nuclear option” — i.e. doing away with the filibuster — but even if advisable it would not get the Senate to 67 votes to override. And remember the House decided not to vote under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (instead taking a vote outside the Cardin-Corker legislative scheme) so there would be little point. That does not mean Congress is entirely powerless either to improve our position now or to help the next president pull the plug on the deal. Sanctions guru Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies suggests Congress designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization. He explains as a practical matter this would mean that “any company doing business in Iran with the IRGC would be doing business with a terrorism organization.” Even the degree to which the IRGC has infiltrated the Iranian economy, this would act as a backstop once sanctions are lifted, slowing the Iranian economy’s recovery. Alternatively (or in addition) Dubowitz recommends “Congressional sanctions that would automatically snap back if Iran is found in violation of any provision of the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action].” In any event, he urges, “Legislation should also establish a congressional commission to oversee the enforcement of [the Iran deal] with permanent staff with appropriate clearances.” Other critics of the president’s Iran appeasement suggest passage of new sanctions to address human rights violations, support for terrorism and/or for the Syrian regime and for continued detention of Americans. This could be every bit as stringent as the sanctions President Obama is lifting by executive waiver. Congress could also vote to supply Israel with bunker-buster bombs (increasing its military option) or an authorization for use of force in the event Iran violates the deal, a finding Congress could make itself. And Congress could vote to void the deal in the event Iran does not satisfy the allow inspection of military bases or disclose the possible military dimensions of its program.

1,"The unresolved fate of American prisoners being held in Iran has long cast a shadow over the nuclear pact with Tehran. But a last-ditch Republican effort to tie the deal to the detainees’ release has Democrats crying foul. On Thursday, Republican Senate leaders will present pro-deal Democratic senators with an uncomfortable choice: In order to protect the agreement, they will have to oppose a resolution to delay lifting sanctions until Iran recognizes Israel’s right to exist and releases Americans being held by the rogue nation. The effort — the third time the Senate will vote on the Iran deal in the last week — is likely to be the last chance the Iran agreement’s opponents have to dismantle the deal, as Thursday marks the end of Congress’s 60-day window to weigh the merits of the nuclear pact. Senate Democrats are attempting to block the measure, as they did the previous two, and they have the numbers to succeed. The new resolution, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) introduced on Tuesday, is in direct contravention of the administration’s rationale that it would have been unwise to tie any part of the nuclear deal to the detainees’ release, in case Iran tried use the prisoners as leverage to negotiate more concessions. Democrats derided McConnell’s maneuver as a political stunt. “No American should ever be used in this way, none of our hostages,” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who represents Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine Corps sergeant who has been held in Iran since 2011. Stabenow accused McConnell of trying “to score some cheap political points, and it’s appalling.” Hekmati is one of three American prisoners currently being held in Iran. The other two are Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor in custody since 2012, and Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent, who was arrested in 2014. A fourth American, Robert Levinson, is often mentioned in connection with those three prisoners after he went missing in Iran in 2007, but the Iranian government denies any knowledge of his whereabouts. McConnell’s resolution is not the first time Republicans have sought to tie the Iran deal to the release of American prisoners and Tehran’s recognition of Israel. Republican presidential candidate and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tried to force similar votes earlier this year during debate over the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which gave Congress the power to consider the deal. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), another presidential candidate, tried to attach an amendment making similar demands to the highway bill in July. In both instances, their efforts failed. McConnell initially decided not to allow amendments during Senate consideration this month of the nuclear deal. But he changed tactics after Democrats filibustered a resolution of disapproval to prevent the straight up-or down vote Republicans wanted. McConnell dismissed Democratic complaints, arguing they forced his hand by blocking a straight vote on the agreement. “The reason for this, quite frankly, is that Chairman [Bob] Corker and I had tried to conduct this debate in a way that would get us to a final vote by discouraging amendments that would’ve altered the president’s deal with Iran,” McConnell told reporters Wednesday. “And what we ended up getting in return was a filibuster against a measure the president is proud of…they trivialized the process that we tried to treat with great respect.” Democrats said McConnell’s maneuver won’t pressure them to change their votes. “Making the political prisoners in Iran part of the new Republican strategy is something I wish Senator McConnell had thought about a little bit,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) “This is not the right thing to do. We want to bring these detainees and prisoners home as quickly as possible, and putting them in the middle of this political debate here I don’t believe is helpful at all.”","The unresolved fate of American prisoners being held in Iran has long cast a shadow over the nuclear pact with Tehran.

0,"Senate Democrats on Thursday beat back a Republican attempt to tie a vote on the nuclear deal with Iran to a requirement that the rogue nation officially recognize the state of Israel and release American prisoners before sanctions on Tehran can be lifted. This series of votes should bring the Senate’s effort to dismantle the deal to an end for the time being, as Congress’s 60-day period to review and potentially block the agreement concluded on Thursday and Republicans turn their attention to other pending issues. Forty-five Democrats, enough to maintain a filibuster, united to block a resolution that would have tied implementation of the deal to Iran recognizing the state of Israel and releasing American prisoners, including Washington Post Tehran correspondent Jason Rezaian. Democrats then for the third time over the past week blocked an up or down vote on the overall agreement on a 56 to 42, with 60 votes needed to advance the measure. Democrats blasted Republicans for playing politics with the fate of hostages by trying to attach them to the pact – something the administration consciously decided against doing during negotiations, in order to not give the Iranians leverage to extract more concessions. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) — who represents Amir Hekmati, a U.S. Marine Corps sergeant held in Iran since 2011 — called the effort “appalling.” Three Democrats who oppose the deal — Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York, Ben Cardin of Maryland and Bob Menendez of New Jersey — sided with their colleagues and voted against the Republican attempt to tie the prisoner concern and Iran’s relations with Israel to the nuclear agreement. Just prior to the vote, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) became almost apologetic when explaining to his panel’s top Democrat, Cardin, why Republicans tried to link the Iran agreement to other contentious issues concerning the rogue nation. “I think out of frustration, and knowing there were a number of members who wanted to express themselves in the way that this amendment is – I think that is the reason that has occurred,” Corker said. “We’re not ever going to be able to get that vote of conscience that all of us have wanted to make.” McConnell and other Republican leaders have defended the series of votes they laid out this week, arguing they were justified in the face of a filibuster from Democrats. Had a simply-majority vote been allowed, the deal’s opponents would have been able to send President Obama a resolution of disapproval he would have had to veto into order to protect the deal. “Democrats went to extreme lengths to protect the president politically,” McConnell said on the floor. “Because they did, Democrats ensured that this would be not just be Obama’s deal with Iran but the Democratic Party’s deal with Iran too.” While the 60-day review period ending on Thursday, House Republicans are promising to keep the debate alive. Last week, they voted to express their lack of confidence in the deal, passed a measure forbidding Obama from lifting sanctions against Iran and adopted a resolution stating Congress’s review clock never actually started ticking, because lawmakers did not receive from the administration the text of two side agreements between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Senate has not announced any plans to take up these bills and leaders appear ready to move on, arguing not much more can be done while Obama is in the White House. But House Republicans say their contention that the review clock never started could form the basis for an eventual lawsuit against the Obama administration to block the deal.  ","Senate Democrats on Thursday beat back a Republican attempt to tie a vote on the nuclear deal with Iran to a requirement that the rogue nation officially recognize the state of Israel and release American prisoners before sanctions on Tehran can be lifted.

0,"IRAQ TO RUSSIA. Iraq is throwing in its cards with Russia in the fight against the Islamic State, The Washington Post reports, setting up a joint intelligence-sharing hub with Iran, Syria and Russia that is set to open in Baghdad within weeks, according to officials. Russia has been jockeying for more influence in the region while shoring up its interests and the government of President Bashar al-Assad by sending military planes and tanks to Syria. But the intel-sharing arrangement to be centered in Baghdad still caught the United States off guard, the New York Times reports. It also puts Putin at center stage as the world turns to the United Nations General Assembly and the diplomatic scurrying that will take place on the sidelines of it this week – not a bad finish for the president of a country that has recently been walloped with sanctions and labeled one of the chief threats to global security.  SHOULD HE STAY OR SHOULD HE GO? Meanwhile the United States has lost at least one ally in its campaign to force Assad out of power. The Guardian reports that British Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated a willingness to see Assad stay on for a while – provided he is eventually tried for war crimes, including gassing his own people. The United States has been trying to train and arm rebels to fight the Islamic State – though those rebels do not have a mandate to fight Assad’s troops, which are also fighting the Islamic State. Nonetheless, the United States remains opposed to Assad’s leadership – as are the rebels they are training. So far, they haven’t done so well – the U.S. backed rebels are small in number, and scared enough that at least one gave his U.S.-issued ammo to the Nusra Front for safe passage. Putin has thoughts on that whole arrangement: He thinks what the United States is doing with Syrian rebels is not just ineffective, it’s illegal. PRISONER SWAP?

Every month for most of this year, I have drawn and updated an editorial cartoon that tally-marks Jason’s unjust detention in a Tehran prison. And every month, my local acquaintance — who says he was once briefly jailed in Iran, for outspokenness against the government — talks of Jason (who has dual Iranian/American citizenship) as a pawn in a larger political game. [Sketchbook: The Post’s Jason Rezaian marks a year behind the bars of injustice] This week, as The Post reported, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has spoken of scenarios that open a window of optimism in Jason’s case. “If we can help free folks who are detained there and they can take reciprocal steps, we’d welcome that approach,” Rouhani said through an interpreter, while in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, in discussing a possible prisoner swap (three Americans for 19 Iranians). Rezaian, The Post’s correspondent in Tehran, has been in custody more than 14 months. He was “tried on espionage and related charges in a secret Revolutionary Court trial that apparently ended six weeks ago,” The Post reported Sunday, noting that no verdict has been announced. “Rezaian’s family, the State Department and senior Post editors have said that Rezaian was wrongly charged for activities that are normal for a journalist.” Up till now, Iranian officials had not offered such cause for guarded optimism, essentially saying there was little they could do in such judicial matters. Now, we have new hope.

Jason has been subjected to a secret, sham trial, solitary confinement, relentless interrogations, physical mistreatment and psychological abuse.

Working Group on Arbitrary Detention took up Jason’s case and called on Iran to uphold international legal obligations, and took up “urgent action” to further confront Iran in its handling of the case. “Iran continues to tell the world it has changed, but how can they expect the international community to believe that if Iran continues to treat Jason the way they treated the U.S. hostages more than 35 years ago,” said Frederick J. Ryan, Jr., publisher, The Washington Post. “It is hard to understand how the United States government or any nation can place the slightest confidence in the words of an oppressive regime that has consistently denied Jason’s basic human rights and is violating their own laws regarding the rights of the accused.” The Washington Post will continue its relentless pursuit of Jason’s release through public and private channels.

This is a test case for the Obama administration to make it clear to Iran that a violation of UNSCR 2231 will be considered a violation of the JCPOA and/or will trigger the reimposition of provisions of all other relevant UN Security Council Resolutions on Iran, including, in the case of long range ballistic missiles capable of carrying a warhead, UNSCR 1929 (2010).” One can bet the administration will, as it does with all Iranian provocations, become the regimes defender insisting this is no big deal and that we will promptly register our “concern.” And last but not least, Iran has stepped up its support for Iraqi Shiite militias and, together with Russia, has intensified its support for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, in essence putting its expected bonanza in sanctions relief to good use already.

0,"LAS VEGAS -- Senate Minority Leader Harry M.

Reid was among more than a half-dozen politicians and pundits who previewed the debate and offered other insights on the election season. [Iranian media: Post correspondent Jason Rezaian convicted] Iranian media reported Monday that Rezaian, imprisoned in Tehran for more than 14 months, had been convicted following an espionage trial that ended in August. Rezaian and The Post have strongly denied the accusations, and the prosecution has drawn wide-ranging denunciations, including statements from the White House and press freedom groups. Reid said he was astonished to learn that the conviction was handed down some time ago but announced only Monday. He said he is “cautiously optimistic” that an appeal will move forward. “I think it’s the best thing for Iran, and it’s damn sure the best thing for us,” Reid said. Reid, who was interviewed in front of a live audience by Post political reporter Paul Kane, also declined an opportunity to endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Reid has spoken in a supportive way about Clinton in the past but said he would make an announcement on his own schedule, possibly ahead of the Nevada caucuses. Reid, who is set to retire in 15 months, also offered kind words about Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton’s chief rival for the nomination, saying he “has been a very fine member of our caucus.” And Reid praised the other three Democrats who will be taking part in Tuesday’s debate, as well as Vice President Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will enter the race.

They reminded him: United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power clearly stated that Iran’s test was a violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 which specifically states that “Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using ballistic missile technology.” We are concerned about the military significance of this test, which is part of a long-term Iranian program that seeks to improve the range and capabilities of its ballistic missiles. We are also convinced that the launch is an attempt to test the world’s will to respond to Iranian violations of its international commitments. We strongly believe that the ability of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to prevent Iran from fulfilling its nuclear ambitions must be fortified by a zero-tolerance policy to respond to violations of the agreement and of applicable UN resolutions – and a unified plan of action between the United States and our European allies about what specific responses should be deployed to respond to incremental violations. Well, what are they doing? Oh, they “urge” the administration to “consider” unilateral or multilateral sanctions. That’s it? “Senate concern about Iran’s recent ballistic missile test is welcome but unfortunately this letter reflects a lack of full appreciation of its import,” Michael Makovsky, chief executive of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), tells me. “The test is a result of the Iran deal, which 9 of the 11 letter signators signed, in two ways.” He explains that not only did the deal, at Iran’s insistence, leave out any discussion of intercontinental ballistic missiles, but more broadly “the deal marked the final collapse of American credibility, encouraging Iran to accelerate its ballistic missile program and other provocative acts (such as in Syria).” Since the deal is entirely the work of Democrats, they bear full responsibility for the consequences. An official with a pro-Israel organization tells me, “Two things must be clear — first, the nuclear deal has only emboldened Iranian misbehavior and second it must be met, not with mere protest, but rather with concrete actions such as hard-hitting sanctions.” What would be meaningful? “If they truly want to repent and show truly concern, then they can impose sanctions on Iran for this violation, support a significant beefing up of our military support for Israel that would augment its ability to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, support strengthening America’s military capabilities in the Middle East and the world, press President Obama to confront Iran in the Middle East and make clear to Iran that we won’t tolerate any such hostile action anymore,” Makovsky says. “That would help for starters.” Mark Dubowitz, a widely regarded sanctions expert, agrees that talk (or letter writing) is cheap. “It’s now time to translate these expressions of concern into something tangible,” he argues. “Congress should pass legislation to statutorily designate all Iranian entities including banks involved in the development, production and testing of these missiles. It’s clear that the Obama administration will do nothing unless forced to act.” On one level, one can see this as an attempt to cover Democrats’ rear ends now that the deal is proving calamitous, just as Republicans predicted. (“It’s a bit late for nine of these Senators to start demonstrating concern over ballistic missiles,” Makovsky notes.) That said, this really does present the opportunity on a bipartisan basis to roll back Iran and perhaps undo an awful deal. Republicans should test their colleagues forthwith. Put a sanctions bill on the floor. If Democrats filibuster it or won’t override a presidential veto, we will know the letter was stained with crocodile tears. And while Republicans are at it, they should put on the president’s desk a bill to keep all sanctions in place unless and until Americans held in Iran, including Post reporter Jason Rezaian, are set free.

Then came the expletives. “Oh, s---!” he would yell. “It’s sliding out of my hand.” Kasich missed more shots than he made, though nobody was keeping score. That wasn’t the point. “You show you can chew gum and walk at the same time,” Kasich told reporters, a little sweat dripping down the side of his face when he finished shooting hoops. “It’s fun.

I had to get a little serious out there because he came out there firing. He was in the three-point range. It was impressive.” Despite building a solid foundation in the early primary state of New Hampshire, Kasich has struggled to break into the Republican presidential race’s top tier nationally. He said his challenge in Tuesday night’s debate is to make sure more people learn about him. Kasich told reporters his game plan is to “just be relaxed and point out to people that no one [else] on that stage has a plan to balance the budget. No one’s ever done it who’s on that stage, or any of the Democrats, and experience matters if you want to turn this country around. I need to let people know that I’ve been able to do these things.” [Opinion: John Kasich calls out the GOP field] Kasich said he was prepared to call out rival candidates — including the co-front-runners, Donald Trump and Ben Carson — for what he described as unreasonable policy proposals, as he did in last month’s CNBC debate. “At the end, we want somebody who can land the plane, not someone who just talks about it,” he said. The Bucks are not the only team Kasich, an NBA fan and proud booster of the Cleveland Cavaliers, has interacted with on the campaign trail. Kasich got into a social media scuffle with the Philadelphia 76ers a couple weeks ago. The governor and the team stayed at the same Radisson hotel in Manchester, N.H., and he talked to the coach and some of the players at breakfast. Later that day, Kasich joked at a town hall meeting that the 76ers don’t have many basketball skills. The team tweeted back at Kasich about his low poll numbers. Kasich told reporters Tuesday that he sees the Milwaukee Bucks as a model of sorts for the trajectory he hopes his campaign has. “This is a young team, and it’s got a lot of potential,” he said. “They’re going to grow.

0,"WORCESTER, Mass. -- As police officers escorted a shouting protester out of the rally Donald Trump held in a converted ice hockey arena on Wednesday night, the crowd of 10,500 held up their cellphone cameras, booed and then chanted: ""USA! USA! USA!"" ""Isn't a Trump rally much more exciting than these other ones?"" the presidential candidate marveled as he took in the scene. ""And that kind of stuff only adds to the excitement, I tell you. Just incredible."" Trump's nontraditional run for the White House has resulted in a series of political rallies across the country where who-knows-what might happen. Here are nine things that happened during Trump's visit to Massachusetts: 1. During a press conference before the rally, reporters pressed Trump to explain why he continues to say President Obama plans to resettle 250,000 Syrian refugees in the United States even though the administration has only publicly committed to accepting 10,000. Trump said his larger number comes from a ""pretty good source"" and is likely accurate because he has correctly predicted a number of other foreign events, including the rise of Osama bin Laden. ""You watch,"" he said, ""I'll be right."" [Conservative suspicions of Syrian refugees grow following Paris attacks] 2. Trump once again cursed as he described what he would do as president to Islamic State terrorists: ""We've got to knock the s--- out of these people. We've got to do it. We've got to do it."" The crowd once again began chanting: ""USA! USA! USA!"" ""And we can do it fast, and we can do it furious,"" Trump continued. ""We can do it. We can do it well."" Trump mocked Obama for having said the Islamic State was contained just before Paris was attacked by terrorists. ""The only thing contained is us,"" Trump said. ""We're contained because we have no leadership."" 3. And Trump continued to warn his supporters that these terrorists could use the Internet as a weapon. ""They're using the Internet, and they're recruiting people,"" Trump said. ""We've got to take back the Internet because they are taking people. They're literally brainwashing people. They're brainwashing our youth... We can't let that happen. We have innocent youth, and they are misguided."" 4. Throughout the evening there were sporadic outbursts from protesters who were led away by police, often shouting and struggling as they went. As television journalists rushed to capture these interactions, Trump's campaign staff members tried to block several of them from doing so, refusing to let reporters leave a barricaded work area they called ""the pen."" After CNN reporter Noah Gray left ""the pen"" to document a group of protesters who unveiled a sign reading ""Migrant lives matter,"" Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski turned to campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks and said: ""Hey: Tell Noah, get back in the pen or he's f------ blacklisted,"" according to a recording of the incident. As Gray went into the crowd to film reaction to the sign, which had already been taken down, Lewandowski confronted him directly: ""Inside the pen, or I will pull your credentials. Media goes in the pen."" Lewandowski at first said the order was because of security, but then said: ""I'm telling you. I'm telling you. Media stays in the pen."" 5. One of the outburst came as Trump questioned the number of Americans on food stamps, a topic he rarely brings up on the campaign trail. As the man who caused it was led away, Trump said: ""You know, it's amazing. I mentioned food stamps and that guy who is seriously overweight went crazy. He went crazy... That's an amazing sight."" 6. After leaving rival Ben Carson alone for a few days, Trump resumed attacking the retired surgeon, pointing to a recent article in the New York Times that quoted a top adviser to Carson saying he had been unable to teach the candidate anything about the Middle East. Although Trump usually slams the newspaper for its coverage of his campaign, he urged the crowd to read its coverage of Carson. ""If you read the front page of the New York Times today, they said about Ben Carson that he's unable to understand foreign policy,"" Trump said. ""You know, his people actually said this, that he's unable to comprehend or understand foreign policy. It was devastating."" [Donald Trump begs Iowans not to believe Ben Carson: ‘Don’t be fools, okay?’] 7. Trump also went after rival Marco Rubio, mocking the senator from Florida for missing votes in Washington and once again calling him ""a lightweight."" ""Everyone says: 'Oh, Rubio, he's the next Reagan.' He's no Reagan -- that I can tell you,"" Trump said. The candidate then took another swipe at the younger politician: ""I mean, my hair is better than his hair, that I can tell you."" 8. And Trump went after Democrats, too, getting big cheers as he said Obama ""has been a disaster for this country."" The crowd also booed Secretary of State John Kerry of Massachusetts, prompting Trump to playfully put a hand to his ear. Trump called former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, a Democrat running for president, ""the other guy, he shouldn't even be on the stage."" And Trump said he does not believe Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has ""the strength or the stamina to be president."" ""She's exhausted, folks,"" Trump said. ""She's exhausted."" 9. As he often does at rallies, Trump asked the crowd what should happen to Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who abandoned his post in Afghanistan in 2009, was held hostage and then rescued. Trump called Bergdahl ""a dirty, rotten traitor."" ""What do we do with Sgt. Bergdahl, 50 years ago?"" Trump asked, calling on an older man sitting near the front who stood and shaped his hand like a gun. ""That's right. Boom. Boom!... Boom, he's gone. He's gone!""","WORCESTER, Mass. -- As police officers escorted a shouting protester out of the rally Donald Trump held in a converted ice hockey arena on Wednesday night, the crowd of 10,500 held up their cellphone cameras, booed and then chanted: ""USA! USA! USA!"" ""Isn't a Trump rally much more exciting than these other ones?"" the presidential candidate marveled as he took in the scene. ""And that kind of stuff only adds to the excitement, I tell you. Just incredible."" Trump's nontraditional run for the White House has resulted in a series of political rallies across the country where who-knows-what might happen. Here are nine things that happened during Trump's visit to Massachusetts: 1. During a press conference before the rally, reporters pressed Trump to explain why he continues to say President Obama plans to resettle 250,000 Syrian refugees in the United States even though the administration has only publicly committed to accepting 10,000.

On Thursday, Jason Rezaian of The Washington Post will have spent 500 days in Iran’s Evin Prison – 500 days robbed of his life, 500 days deprived of his family, 500 days denied any semblance of justice,” said Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post. “Jason has done nothing wrong. Iran has never even bothered to produce any evidence against him. His so-called trial was a sham. Recent announcements, without details, of his supposed ‘conviction’ and ‘sentencing’, have only added new layers of cruelty. Iran’s senior leaders have said for months that they would like Jason’s case to be resolved. The fact that Jason is still behind bars calls their credibility and commitment into question.

Last week, The Post filed a supplemental submission to its initial urgent action petition to the UNWGAD further detailing the deplorable conditions of Rezaian’s confinement, and resulting impact on his health; specific and egregious violations of basic due process under Iran’s own law as well as international human-rights norms; and refutation of the vague, self-contradictory, and bizarre allegations recently made public against Jason by Iranian MPs. The supplement states: “Since the initial petition to the Working Group, Rezaian has suffered further personal mistreatment, violations of law, and declining health. Rezaian continues to lose weight; he suffers from blood pressure complications and other physical and mental medical conditions that remain untreated or poorly treated. He has been subjected to further interrogations, psychological abuse, and physical mistreatment. He is deprived of normal human interactions, forced to wear a hood when he is escorted around the prison by guards or interrogators, and is closely monitored at all times. Moreover, there have been further egregious denials of due process since Petitioners filed the initial petition with the Working Group in July 2015. After a protracted trial that took place over four months, Rezaian’s counsel was told on August 5 that a verdict would be issued within one week. Under Iranian law, Rezaian would have had twenty days from the time the verdict was issued to appeal (which would have been September 2). But no verdict was formally announced, leaving Rezaian languishing in prison and uncertain of his fate. It was not until October 11—two full months after the Iranian Judiciary stated publicly the trial had ended—that Iran’s state media reported that a conviction had been issued.

Five hundred days is five hundred too long.

If the callous regime in Tehran imprisons and abuses a fully accredited and innocent journalist, what might they do to a visiting delegation? How would they treat employees stationed in Iran? Five hundred days is five hundred too long. During these 500 days, Jason has been subjected to harsh interrogations, held in isolation for extended periods, denied adequate medical care, and afforded only a few perfunctory opportunities to speak with his defense lawyer. We share in the outrage expressed by hundreds of thousands of people around the world who have signed petitions calling for Jason’s immediate release. How long can this cruel and unjust imprisonment be allowed to continue? This blatant violation of Jason’s basic human rights must end now. It is time for Jason Rezaian to come home. Timeline: 500 days in an Iranian prison: The ordeal of Post reporter Jason Rezaian"
0,"    DAY BY day, his family and friends and colleagues wait. Lie by lie, his captors keep him behind bars, sentenced and silenced. And line by line, I mark each day that Justice is held hostage. Today is Day 500 that Jason Rezaian, The Post’s correspondent in Tehran, has been detained, quietly found guilty of charges that include espionage, and held in Iran’s infamous Evin Prison. Post Executive Editor Martin Baron calls today “the grimmest” of milestones. As The Post reported yesterday, Rezaian has been in captivity “56 days longer than the hostages held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran after the 1979 Islamic revolution.” Supporters, including Rezaian’s employer, has stepped up calls for the reporter’s release, The Post reported, “including updated filings by The Post with a U.N. panel” that “seek to boost international leverage on Iran.” Line by line, I aim to illustrate a reminder that Rezaian, as The Post says, has endured a legal fiasco and sham. Lie by lie, the Iranian justice system renders judgment, or misjudgment, in the darkness of secrecy. “This isn’t a real case, but rather a case of political theater,” David W. Bowker, an attorney at the firm of WilmerHale who is representing The Post, was quoted as saying in this newspaper. Demands grow louder in the belief that pressure can be increased. Day 500 is the grimmest of milestones, indeed. But the noise needed to avert a Day 600, or longer, should not be dimmed. Mark by mark, we hope justice can be drawn out of cruelty.","    DAY BY day, his family and friends and colleagues wait. Lie by lie, his captors keep him behind bars, sentenced and silenced.

0,"The massacre in San Bernardino, Calif., this week overshadowed another major foreign policy story: The International Atomic Energy Agency’s report on Iran. The Associated Press reported: Iran did work related to developing nuclear arms in the past, the U.N. atomic agency concluded in a report Wednesday that wraps up a near decade of investigations and opens the way to implementing a landmark deal aimed at reducing any future nuclear threat from Tehran. Iran has consistently denied any interest in nuclear arms or past work on such weapons, and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqhchi told Iranian television that the International Atomic Energy Agency report “confirms the peaceful nature” [of] Iran’s nuclear program. But the report contested that view and came down on the side of U.S. allegations, saying the agency “assesses that a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device were conducted in Iran prior to the end of 2003 as a coordinated effort, and some activities took place” up to 2009. In other words, we know definitively that Iran lied about its prior efforts to build a nuclear weapon. (So much for the phony fatwa President Obama kept referring to that was supposed to have banned the quest for nuclear weapons.) “It is a major flaw in the Iran deal that sanctions relief doesn’t depend on Tehran fully and honestly disclosing the nature and extent of its nuclear weapons-related activities. Iran will now get hundreds of billions of dollars without ever admitting its role in developing nuclear weapons,” sanctions expert Mark Dubowitz says. “Its track record of nuclear mendacity is not a good sign for future transparency and faithful compliance.” In a similar vein, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, put out a statement: The IAEA report proves Iran lied.  For years, the Iranian regime worked secretly to develop a nuclear weapon.  And there are still important questions that remain unanswered.  For example, how far did Iran get toward building a bomb? And what happened to all of the materials, research, and expertise Iran acquired? Iran’s long track record of obstructing investigators means the IAEA will face significant challenges moving forward – especially since the president’s nuclear agreement allows Iran to carry out self-inspections at key sites.  Iran won’t even have to cheat to achieve advanced enrichment capacity, which puts them just a small step away from a bomb. Congress is attempting to exert greater scrutiny over the administration. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, announced, “As the JCPOA with Iran moves toward Implementation Day, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will initiate a rigorous program to ensure effective Congressional monitoring and oversight of this agreement as well as its regional and nonproliferation implication.” The schedule includes hearings this month on the IAEA report. Corker also indicated, “The senators also requested regular interagency briefings consistent with reporting requirements of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015.” But, of course, hearings — unless they induce the administration to take action against potential violations — are not preventative measures; they are exercises in accountability. To that end, Congress should methodically examine whether the representations it made about the deal are turning out to be true. If not — if the deal is really not as advertised — Congress has every right to reinstate nuclear-related sanctions. Indeed, it might feel obligated to do so. Interestingly, Senate Democrats continue to hear from angry and worried pro-Israel constituents about their filibuster. Perhaps Democrats would appreciate a second bite at the apple, especially in light of Iran’s recent behavior, including continued imprisonment of Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who just passed 500 days in detention. Critics argue that sanctions should not be lifted (quite apart from Iran’s non-nuclear-related activity for which new sanctions are entirely warranted). William Tobey writes: A baseline declaration is necessary for effective international monitoring. Moreover, this issue is about the future. Neither the IAEA nor the United States can be confident that Iran’s nuclear weapons development work will not resume if all aspects of the past activities are not well understood and dismantled. Where, for example, is the explosive chamber that was used at Parchin, and to what purpose is it being put today? Were other chambers fabricated and used? What became of the nuclear explosion modeling? Who was involved in it and what are they doing now? The Iran deal will go forward. Sanctions will be lifted. The bedrock principle of safeguards work — a complete and correct declaration followed by IAEA verification — will be fractured (temporarily at least), with U.S. complicity. Why should future proliferators not invoke the Iran deal precedent, under which the Iranians pretend to comply with their obligations, and we pretend to believe them? Why even should Tehran take seriously all the administration’s huffing and puffing about the importance of compliance? The sham Iran deal has ushered in a new era of appeasement, one in which the administration dare not take action against Iran for human rights violations, aggression in the region or even the impermissible launch of a missile. As Congress sits idly by as the administration averts its eyes, its culpability in a disastrous deal increases.","The massacre in San Bernardino, Calif., this week overshadowed another major foreign policy story: The International Atomic Energy Agency’s report on Iran.

0,"THE MORNING PLUM: A new national poll finds that Ted Cruz is on the move: he’s quadrupled his support among GOP voters nationally. Cruz is being increasingly talked about as a plausible GOP nominee. But what’s Cruz’s theory of the case when it comes to winning the general election? On Morning Joe today, Cruz gave us an answer that’s worth quoting at length: “Every day as I travel this country, people stop me, and they say, ‘I’m a Democrat. I voted for Barack Obama. And this isn’t working. I’m with you.’ “Washington thinks the core of our base is very different from who they are. The core of our political base are the Reagan Democrats. They are the blue collar Catholics across the Midwest and up in New England. They are union members, gun owners, pro-life, strong national defense. They are truck drivers and mechanics and electricians and plumbers and schoolteachers and nurses and waiters and waitresses. “They’re working men and women who are getting hammered by the Obama economy. And they’re tired of the Washington elites who are not fighting for the working men and women in this country. That’s how we win in November of 2016.” I’m not sure how many “Reagan Democrats” there are these days — aren’t they mostly aging Republicans now? — but this opens an interesting window on to a divide among Republicans over the best route to the White House. Cruz is essentially saying that the way to win is to maximize support among blue collar whites who are culturally conservative and are suspicious of activist government in the Obama era — voters who have already been fleeing the Democratic Party for many years now. Democrats have long admitted that losing these voters is a problem that they must address. At the same time, though, it’s unclear how much of a problem it will pose for their 2016 chances. Democrats continue to retain confidence in their new coalition of millennials, minorities, socially liberal college-educated whites and single women, which helped power Barack Obama’s wins in the last two national elections. While the big unknown remains whether likely Dem nominee Hillary Clinton can turn out these Obama groups in Obama-level numbers, analysts (such as Dem pollster Stan Greenberg) continue to believe, with qualifications, that this confidence is probably well placed. What’s interesting, though, is that some of the other Republican candidates also appear to share this Democratic theory of the case, in the sense that they believe a Republican must broaden the party’s demographic appeal and cut into these Dem groups to win. Jeb Bush has explicitly made this case, and Marco Rubio has sought to project an optimistic, inclusive aura that seems designed not just to unite Republicans but also to appeal (at least on the margins) to Latinos and millennials. By contrast, while Cruz says publicly that he wants to win over Reagan “Democrats,” the more plausible interpretation of his approach is that it’s built around the idea that the electorate is hopelessly polarized and that maximizing conservative and GOP base turnout is the route to victory. Thus, Cruz and Rubio continue to be (slightly) at odds over immigration. And as Jonathan Chait details today, Cruz is plainly trying to find a sweet spot between Rubio and Donald Trump on policy. He’s positioning himself as a hard-core pro-liberty conservative, a scourge of the GOP establishment and true warrior (unlike those squish GOP leaders who despise him for revealing their true colors) against the Obama agenda, as well as a real hard-liner on terrorism, which has required him to sidle up to Donald Trump’s demagoguery while pretending not to. There’s a lot of GOP hand-wringing about how Trump might drive growing segments of the electorate away from the party, but it’s not clear Cruz is all that determined to do what it takes to make inroads in with those groups, either. * TRUMP CONTINUES TO DOMINATE: A new New York Times/CBS poll finds: Mr. Trump commands the support of 35 percent of Republican primary voters, leading his closest competitors, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas (16 percent) and Ben Carson (13 percent) by a more than 2-to-1 margin. While Mr. Carson’s support was cut in half since the last time The Times and CBS News polled on the race in late October, Mr. Cruz has quadrupled his share. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida’s support stands at 9 percent. Cruz really does appear to be on the move. Also: Rubiomentum!!! Or, you know, maybe not. * THE METHOD TO DONALD TRUMP’S MADNESS: Paul Schwartzman and Jenna Johnson have a fantastic piece that digs deep into Trump’s rhetorical patterns and finds, counter-intuitively, that he’s actually a very disciplined candidate: He attacks a regular cast of villains including undocumented immigrants, Muslims, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, his GOP rivals and the media. He keeps the narrative arc of each controversy alive with an endless stream of statements, an unwillingness to back down even when he has misstated the facts — and a string of attacks against those who criticize him. All the while, his supporters see a truth-talking problem solver unlike the traditional politicians who have let them down. I would only add that Trump also repeats variations of the idea that “something is wrong,” feeding vague, generalized uncertainty and anxiety, with remarkable regularity. * TED CRUZ BATTLES TRUMP IN IOWA: CNN has a fascinating look at the competing strategies that the Ted Cruz and Trump campaigns are employing in Iowa, which represent differing bets on the makeup of the GOP caucus-goers’ electorate: Trump’s strategy relies more on expanding the caucus electorate, while Cruz is taking the more traditional route and rolling up key Iowa endorsers and validators like Rep. Steve King….the [Trump] campaign is bringing new voters into the process. Many of their supporters are first-time caucus-goers who aren’t necessarily polled. The challenge, of course, is to make sure those would-be voters show up on February 1. The big question, in Iowa and everywhere else, is whether these Trump supporters, who are being energized by his concoction of demagoguery against immigrants, Muslims, and all sorts of other villains, will actually show up. * REPUBLICANS HAD BETTER TREAT TRUMP WITH ‘RESPECT,’ OR ELSE! Trump has now told CNN that he still might mount an independent run if he doesn’t win the GOP nomination, if he is not treated with a “certain amount of decorum and respect.” He added: “If they don’t treat me as the front-runner — by far the front-runner — if the playing field is not level, then certainly all options are open…But that’s nothing I want to do….We’ll go through the primaries, we’ll see what happens and I’ll make a determination.” Trump had signed a pledge to support the GOP nominee provided he is treated “fairly.” Now he is adding the condition that he must also be accorded “respect,” and treated “as the front-runner.” * ANTI-MUSLIM FERVOR WHIPS UP GOP BASE: E.J. Dionne finds the roots of today’s Trump-fed anti-Muslim fervor in the 2010 battle over the Ground Zero mosque (remember that?), which at the time appeared to be about driving up GOP base turnout. Dionne adds: The Republican establishment is now all upset with Trump, but he is simply the revenge of a Republican base that took its leaders’ pandering — on Islam and a host of other issues — seriously. Yep. Shocking that GOP base voters who have been fed lies and distortions for years about the decline of America under Obama would turn to Trump, isn’t it? * AND TRUMP CANCELS HIS TRIP TO ISRAEL: The Donald tweets this morning: This comes after Netanyahu rejected Trump’s call for a Muslim ban. Now Trump is canceling his trip in what may be a snit over their disagreement. Only a Big Loser would do that!","THE MORNING PLUM: A new national poll finds that Ted Cruz is on the move: he’s quadrupled his support among GOP voters nationally.

0,"Earlier today, Washington Post Publisher Frederick J. Ryan, Jr. thanked the staff for making 2015 an exceptional year. Read his memo to the company: Dear Washington Post Colleagues, As we approach year-end, I would like to thank everyone on the team for making 2015 such an exceptional year for The Washington Post. Named “The World’s Most Innovative Media Company” by Fast Company, and “Most Innovative Publisher of 2015” by Digiday, The Post is being recognized throughout the industry as a digital media leader. This year, The Washington Post consistently shattered all of our previous traffic records, most recently setting a new record of 71.6 million unique visitors in November, surpassing all of our traditional competitors. Even more important is the increase we’ve seen in the amount of time readers are spending on our site, with an average of nearly 15 minutes per person. To have both unique visitors and time spent grow is a testament to the user experience we are building across platforms and devices—when readers come to The Post, they stay for more. This growth is a result of the commitment to quality journalism and hard work of our newsroom, supported by rapid advances in engineering. This year, our newsroom launched the first-ever database on police shootings nationwide that prompted the FBI to announce that it would finally develop its own database. Carol Leonnig was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for her series of stories exposing serious failures at the Secret Service, which resulted in a top-to-bottom review of the agency by the Department of Homeland Security. Our unmatched politics team has led the way with pacesetting coverage of the presidential election, and we launched the highly successful PowerPost section online along with The Daily 202 email newsletter. Our opinions team, led by Fred Hiatt, launched In Theory, a new kind of debate blog that has provided a forum for intellectual arguments on everything from gun rights to killer robots. Alexandra Petri’s blog Compost hit a new stride, with countless posts that have attracted readers with their wit and originality. Our editorial page emerged as a powerful voice for tolerance during a particularly unsettled time; to advocate for continuing American generosity toward refugees and immigrants; and to oppose any discrimination based on religion or ethnicity. Our technology team has had a stellar year. In close cooperation with the newsroom, they shipped a long list of innovative products to delight our readers, including beautifully designed apps for phones, tablets and emerging platforms like Apple Watch, Apple TV, Android TV and FireTV. We became the first media company to join the likes of Google and Facebook in making our desktop and mobile sites https compliant, protecting the privacy and security of our readers. Our team of data engineers launched Clavis, a smart, algorithmic engine that drives significantly higher reader engagement on recommended stories. A very exciting development on the engineering front has been Arc. We have not only pushed the edges of technology to power our own systems, we have now started licensing our technology platform in the marketplace. 2015 has also been a banner year for broadcast appearances, with interviews nearly doubling in number from 2014. To give you a sense of this accomplishment, the PR team put together a short clip reel of appearances from the last few months alone, which can be seen here. As we close out the year, I also want to thank all of the people who work behind the scenes in places like accounting, legal, circulation, production and others. Their contributions to the company this year have been numerous. For example, our production team has grown their capacity to be a printer and mail provider for the greater metropolitan area, recently signing new clients to be printed, including The New York Times and the Korea Times. They have grown this part of our business while remarkably reducing expenses, adding millions to the company’s bottom line. Innovations like these are happening throughout the company, and I applaud all of the hard work and dedication of our staff. As we settle into our spectacular new headquarters, we all owe a big thanks to Steve Gibson, Wayne Connell, Shailesh Prakash, Patrick Burton, Tracy Grant and their teams for leading a seamless transition to our new state-of-the-art headquarters. It was a Herculean effort over many, many months, and we are already enjoying the benefits in this modern, collaborative, light-filled space. We should each take pause during this season of hope and goodwill to reflect upon the plight of our colleague Jason Rezaian. Our hearts remain heavy as yet another year comes to a close and Jason remains imprisoned in Evin Prison by the Iranian regime. Words cannot adequately express our outrage at this gross injustice and we will remain relentless in our efforts, both public and private, to secure his release.

Our editorial page emerged as a powerful voice for tolerance during a particularly unsettled time; to advocate for continuing American generosity toward refugees and immigrants; and to oppose any discrimination based on religion or ethnicity. Our technology team has had a stellar year. In close cooperation with the newsroom, they shipped a long list of innovative products to delight our readers, including beautifully designed apps for phones, tablets and emerging platforms like Apple Watch, Apple TV, Android TV and FireTV. We became the first media company to join the likes of Google and Facebook in making our desktop and mobile sites https compliant, protecting the privacy and security of our readers. Our team of data engineers launched Clavis, a smart, algorithmic engine that drives significantly higher reader engagement on recommended stories. A very exciting development on the engineering front has been Arc. We have not only pushed the edges of technology to power our own systems, we have now started licensing our technology platform in the marketplace. 2015 has also been a banner year for broadcast appearances, with interviews nearly doubling in number from 2014. To give you a sense of this accomplishment, the PR team put together a short clip reel of appearances from the last few months alone, which can be seen here. As we close out the year, I also want to thank all of the people who work behind the scenes in places like accounting, legal, circulation, production and others. Their contributions to the company this year have been numerous. For example, our production team has grown their capacity to be a printer and mail provider for the greater metropolitan area, recently signing new clients to be printed, including The New York Times and the Korea Times. They have grown this part of our business while remarkably reducing expenses, adding millions to the company’s bottom line. Innovations like these are happening throughout the company, and I applaud all of the hard work and dedication of our staff. As we settle into our spectacular new headquarters, we all owe a big thanks to Steve Gibson, Wayne Connell, Shailesh Prakash, Patrick Burton, Tracy Grant and their teams for leading a seamless transition to our new state-of-the-art headquarters. It was a Herculean effort over many, many months, and we are already enjoying the benefits in this modern, collaborative, light-filled space. We should each take pause during this season of hope and goodwill to reflect upon the plight of our colleague Jason Rezaian. Our hearts remain heavy as yet another year comes to a close and Jason remains imprisoned in Evin Prison by the Iranian regime. Words cannot adequately express our outrage at this gross injustice and we will remain relentless in our efforts, both public and private, to secure his release. Fred."
0,"Earlier today, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron sent the following note to the newsroom:  This has been a remarkable and immensely gratifying year. We’ve received widespread recognition for our stunning gains in digital readership, taking us to levels that were unimagined only a year or two ago. We’ve also moved quickly to introduce new, leading-edge products, earning The Post a reputation as one of the world’s most innovative media companies. As we’ve done all that, we’ve built upon The Post’s legacy of soaring journalistic ambition, demonstrating that success in the modern information era still depends on smart ideas, authoritative reporting, crisp and elegant writing, and arresting images and presentation. So many people turn to us because we tell them what they need to know and because they know we strive for coverage that is interesting and honest, determined and honorable, informed but independent, fair but also unflinching. The dedication and talent of this newsroom was on display throughout the year. Whether it was terror abroad or terror at home, whether a chaotic response to a Metro fire or a grotesque murder on live television, whether a mass shooting in San Bernardino or one in Charleston, you moved quickly to cover the news comprehensively, intelligently, and with sensitivity. You had more than your share of major scoops, and you always dug for stories that told a deeper truth about consequences and causes and people. Overseas, you’ve shown resourcefulness and courage in documenting some of the biggest stories of our time: the unnerving threat of the Islamic State, endless devastation in Syria, mass movement of humanity from one part of the world to another, enduring economic and political stress in Europe, and China’s assertion of power domestically and among its neighbors. Your stories and images have communicated the drama of this moment, both in broad strokes and in terms painfully intimate. You’ve been a commanding presence in the coverage of police shootings. The Post’s database supplied information that the federal government had never collected, and ultimately it embarrassed the FBI into a pledge that it would develop a database of its own. Sophisticated data reporting also was at the heart of a series of stories about sharp increases in spending on college sports within the NCAA. The expenses were jaw-dropping in their extravagance. Such accountability reporting has a long history at The Post, and it’s very much a part of our present. Metro’s investigation into abuses in the “structured settlement” industry is a model of how a story can be aggressively developed. Deeply reported pieces were a signature of our work over the past year: the origins of disturbingly persistent vulnerabilities in the Internet; the shifting influence of money in politics; efforts to give the body and mind a giant upgrade; the human struggles that define a struggling economy; how the drug war comes to its uncertain end; and the ravages of heroin as it makes a resurgence. Our politics coverage has been exceptional, an object of justifiable admiration in a field of intensifying competition. The team demonstrates daily that it can do anything and everything — exclusives one after the next, timely and sophisticated analyses, revelatory portraits of the candidates and their supporters, digital posts that are fast and pointed and full of insight, and investigations into subjects the candidates would prefer be forgotten or ignored. Our presence in the arena of politics and policy was also enhanced with the well-received introduction of PowerPost and its anchor email newsletter, The Daily 202. You also delivered richly reported, beautifully crafted narratives that required deep immersion in others’ lives: how a fifth-grader was told she has HIV; how young men, though concerned about what a suspected mass shooter was doing and saying, did nothing; what it means to try resuming a life after barely surviving a mass shooting. You have given readers lively, enlightening criticism on sports, books, music, television, movies — all of the arts, really – and penetrating commentary on people who live at the margins of our own community. We have opened our site and pages as well to ordinary individuals who have powerful stories of their own, and we helped them allow the world into their lives. We also provided a forum for fresh, provocative voices of commentary and analysis, fulfilling our aspiration to be a venue of intellectual innovation. All of that has been hard work, and it doesn’t begin to capture all you have done. For all the words written, there have been photographs and videos of equal force. And graphics and visualizations of astounding effectiveness. And presentations, in print and online and on our apps, that command readers’ attention. And rigorous editing that held us all to high standards. It’s been heartening to see how this ambitious newsroom has adapted so well to today’s patterns of news consumption — digital, and now heavily mobile. You consistently write smartly in the moment, with unique insights, distinct angles, and all the tools now available to us on the web, and you do this with vigor at every hour of the day and night, with stories that are substantive but also just good yarns – doing what used to be called “second day” stories on the first day, giving readers something great to share and leaving competitors to chase us. You have learned what is needed to attract a large digital audience, and you’ve been aided immeasurably in this by a savvy audience and engagement team, among the best anywhere. Above all, you worked as a team because you know that together we are so much stronger than if we only work alone. This was a year when we felt the absence of two cherished colleagues. Correspondent Jason Rezaian sits in an Iranian prison, where he has been held unjustly for 528 days, and we hope that the new year brings him the freedom to which he is entitled. It was also just over a year ago that we lost photojournalist Michel du Cille as he devoted himself to capturing the full toll of Ebola. In an essay two months before his death, Michel explained why he did what he did. “The story must be told,” he said simply. All of you this year have told stories that needed telling. You told them exquisitely well, and you told them to more people than ever. You have my deepest gratitude. The brilliantly organized move into our spectacular new newsroom sets the stage for yet another year of great journalism. The Post’s new home inspires us to look ahead with confidence even as we pay homage to a glorious past. There can be no better way to honor our history than to secure our future.","Earlier today, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron sent the following note to the newsroom:  This has been a remarkable and immensely gratifying year.

0,"The Obama administration, the mainstream media and Democrats more generally vastly underestimate the potency of the photos and videos showing our Navy sailors on their knees with hands behind their heads as they are taken into custody by the Iranians. It is the perfect embodiment of what many Americans see as the humiliation suffered by the United States under this president as our adversities defy us and take advantage at every turn. To then have the utterly tone-deaf Secretary of State John Kerry insist that we did not apologize, but then publicly thank Iran, is even worse. And to top it off, we have film of our sailors held captive, compelled to apologize. The sole female sailor apparently was compelled to don a head covering. This, according to President Obama and Hillary Clinton, is what a successful Iran policy looks like. No wonder Donald Trump, who speaks to the rage Americans feel about our declining respect in the world, is striking a chord. The Wall Street Journal reports: Iran released a set of videos of U.S. sailors who were released Wednesday after being captured and detained overnight, raising questions about whether the country’s hard-line military force mistreated the Americans or violated international law by using them for propaganda purposes. One video, broadcast on Iranian television and released world-wide, showed several Americans kneeling, with their hands clasped behind their heads. Another showed a U.S. service member speaking to a questioner, admitting wrongdoing and apologizing. Obama administration officials have said their initial determination is that the 10 sailors were treated well and with respect after Iranian forces detained their two small Navy boats in the Persian Gulf on Tuesday. But the videos depicted questionable actions by Iran’s elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Geneva Conventions, which govern military conflicts, ban the practice of parading prisoners for purposes of “insults” and propaganda. The White House won’t dream of making a fuss, not when it so desperately wants to lift sanctions on Iran and push forward on the Iran nuclear deal, the very deal that has emboldened Iran to engage in stunts like this one. Oh, the administration is going to  be “looking into the videos and would respond if the U.S. determined that the sailors were treated inappropriately.” Don’t hold your breath. This is a propaganda bonanza for Tehran, one that it will exploit to the hilt to make clear to its allies and those it seeks to intimidate that the United States is weak, unreliable and useless. It furthers their ambitions in the region and demoralizes those resisting Iranian aggression. For countries and individuals on the fence (e.g. the Sunni tribes), the message is clear: You really want to stick your neck out for the Americans? Bizarrely, Kerry thinks this shows how terrific our new relationship with Iran is because, you know, we got our people back. By continuing to act in effect as a PR flack for Tehran, Kerry invites further aggression and endangers our own troops and those of our allies. Be prepared to see Iran’s conduct become infinitely more audacious once it has pocketed more than $100 billion in sanctions relief. Republicans at home have every reason to point to this incident as a vivid demonstration of the end result of the policy of appeasement and retreat under the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy. Clinton, fighting for her life in the Iowa caucuses, is not about to criticize the president from the right. But Republicans should not be shy about holding the administration accountable for a foreign policy that really does hold us hostage to the whims of the mullahs. We have come full circle. In 1980, it was the news coverage of Americans held hostage in Tehran that helped doom the reelection chances of an ineffectual president. Now the incumbent president’s foreign policy architect runs for a “third term” on her experience — as we see photographic evidence of our capitulation to Tehran. The problem, however, for Republicans is plain: Who is the Ronald Reagan to rescue the country from this demoralizing tailspin? As the presidential race plays out, Republicans in Congress should hold hearings and promptly vote on new sanctions against Iran for its illegal missile tests, support for terrorism, military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, continued imprisonment of Americans (including The Post’s Jason Rezaian) and its brutalization of its own people. Democrats in the House and Senate who claim to be “profoundly” concerned about Iran need to match their votes with their rhetoric. If once again they choose to circle the wagons around a feckless White House and block sanctions, the voters can hold them responsible in 2016, 2018 and 2020. And really, if they don’t vote when it matters, they should stop with the crocodile tears — and let those prepared to do something about Iran take charge.","The Obama administration, the mainstream media and Democrats more generally vastly underestimate the potency of the photos and videos showing our Navy sailors on their knees with hands behind their heads as they are taken into custody by the Iranians.

0,"American evangelical pastor Saeed Abedini is among the four Americans Iran who were released on Saturday, according to U.S. and Iranian officials. For more than three years, evangelical activists have pressed President Obama to push for his release, arguing that it should be part of a larger nuclear deal. Abedini, 35, of Boise, Idaho, is a convert from Islam to Christianity and pastor who had been imprisoned since 2012 for organizing home churches. His case was the most high-profile religious persecution for Christians in recent years, regularly mentioned by evangelical pastors in pulpits across the country. His case put a face on the issue of persecution, especially in the Middle East, for Christians across the globe, and his release comes on “religious freedom day” in the U.S. [Iran to free Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, 3 others, Iranian reports say] His wife, Naghmeh Abedini, who grew up in Boise and lives there with the couple’s two children, Rebekka, 9, and Jacob, 7, told the Washington Post on Saturday that she woke her two children up early at 7:30 a.m. to tell them of the news that their father had been released. “They were shocked,” she said. “You can probably hear them now, jumping up and down, asking ‘When are we going to see him?’ It’s been a time of rejoicing.” Naghmeh Abedini has been a high-profile advocate for her husband, posting updates on social media regularly and speaking regularly at Christian conferences across the country. Saeed Abedini had established small house churches in Iran, and he was convicted in 2013 of threatening Iran’s national security. Born and raised in Iran, Abedini became a U.S. citizen in 2010. In July 2012, he visited the country of Georgia, and when he tried to enter Iran to see his parents, his passport was taken and he was put under house arrest, then later imprisoned in September, his wife said. In November, Naghmeh Abedini began to back away from her high-profile role in the campaign, telling supporters by email that her husband had been abusive to her and she can “no longer live a lie.” Christianity Today published two emails Naghmeh Abedini sent to supporters about her troubled marriage, which began in 2004. She confirmed that she had experienced “physical, emotional, psychological, and sexual abuse through her husband’s addiction to pornography.” She wrote at the time, “The abuse started early in their marriage and has worsened during Saeed’s imprisonment,” which she confirmed on Saturday. The two had been speaking by phone and through Skype, but she said she has not spoken with him since October. She said the timing of those emails, which were leaked to media, was unfortunate. “When he gets home, we can address the serious issues that have happened and continued,” she said. [Previously: Citing abuse, wife of U.S. pastor held in Iran says she’ll stop public campaigning] She said her husband will undergo a medical examination and they can assess his physical and emotional state. She said he had been beaten and interrogated when he was first imprisoned and suffered internal bleeding, but she does not know his current physical condition. Abedini said that once they leave Iranian soil, they will discuss if she will fly and meet him somewhere or if they will meet when he returns to the U.S. Abedini, who attends the nondenominational Calvary Chapel in Boise, said it’s unclear whether her husband will continue to be a pastor, though it’s always been “his heart.” “I think he would have to deal with a lot of issues,” she said. “There will need to be a time of healing for him and his family.” Details of her abuse will eventually have to be addressed within the evangelical community, where she has been a prominent spokesperson for international religious freedom, said Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. “I dont think today is the day to address that,” he said. “I was stunned and surprised by Naghmeh’s statement. I did not know any of that. It was and is very troubling.” Saeed Abedini’s release was part of the nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers in which Iran agreed to an exchange for at least six people imprisoned or charged in the U.S. “I don’t generally believe in prisoner exchanges,” said Moore, who noted that he also opposes the nuclear deal. “That said, one can oppose of a plan and still rejoice in the release of prisoners of conscience.” Naghmeh Abedini said she has grown interested in religious persecution, not just of Christians but Sunni Muslims, Baha’is and others under threat in the Middle East. “As a Christian, I believe God gives freedom, including to be an atheist,” she said. “My husband has opened my eyes to the plight of people of different beliefs.” Naghmeh Abedini was born in Iran and moved to the U.S. with her parents when she was 9 and became a citizen when they did. She was working in project management for a manufacturing company when her husband was put in prison but left her job so she could travel and speak on her husband’s behalf. She said her faith has grown stronger since her husband was put in prison. “We’ve all learned to have peace no matter what came our way in the midst of ups and downs,” she said. “We’ve trusted God and his timing, and today was the timing.” In October, she wrote an op-ed letter to President Obama for The Washington Post in which she described the agony her family has faced, and said she had hoped that the nuclear deal would mean prisoners like her husband would be freed. [Naghmeh Abedini asks Obama to help bring her husband home] She said on Saturday that initial meetings with the U.S. State Department about her husband were very difficult, describing officials as “stand-off-ish” since they had issued travel warnings to U.S. citizens about Iran. She said she began to have more hope after Secretary of State John Kerry urged her husband’s release in 2013. Abedini has been the most famous imprisoned pastor in the world for the last several years, said Johnnie Moore, an evangelical activist for Middle Eastern Christians and former Liberty University campus pastor. (He is not related to Russell Moore). “It was symbolic for people like Saeed who for their faith are captured and held indefinitely,” he said. Johnnie Moore criticized the U.S. government’s deal. “Iran is driving a hard bargain with the United States, and I think the United States has given too much,” he said. “If we allow exchanges like this, it incentivizes more kidnapping of people.” Jordan Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice, a religious freedom organization that has worked with the family, said that this was a clear window for Abedini’s release. “We dealt with the reality that this administration decided to sit down with the Iran and do a deal,” Sekulow said. “At the beginning, there wasn’t this kind of dialogue. I don’t think we’re at a point where we can pass judgment on the details.” Many evangelical leaders have pressed the Obama administration for Abedini’s release. At the late South African leader Nelson Mandela’s memorial service in 2013 at the Washington National Cathedral, the Rev. Rob Schenck said he begged Kerry to not forget Saeed Abedini. “He put his hand over his heart and said, ‘Reverend, I promise I will do everything possible to see that this man is free. I promise you I will not forget,'” Schenck said. “His wife nudged him as if to say, ‘You better not forget.'” Schenck said that Christians should be thankful that whatever the circumstances he will be reunited with his family. “Religious conservatives who tend to be critical of the Obama administration really need to give credit where credit is due,” he said.

How one evangelical activist changed his mind on gun violence","American evangelical pastor Saeed Abedini is among the four Americans Iran who were released on Saturday, according to U.S. and Iranian officials. For more than three years, evangelical activists have pressed President Obama to push for his release, arguing that it should be part of a larger nuclear deal. Abedini, 35, of Boise, Idaho, is a convert from Islam to Christianity and pastor who had been imprisoned since 2012 for organizing home churches. His case was the most high-profile religious persecution for Christians in recent years, regularly mentioned by evangelical pastors in pulpits across the country. His case put a face on the issue of persecution, especially in the Middle East, for Christians across the globe, and his release comes on “religious freedom day” in the U.S. [Iran to free Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, 3 others, Iranian reports say] His wife, Naghmeh Abedini, who grew up in Boise and lives there with the couple’s two children, Rebekka, 9, and Jacob, 7, told the Washington Post on Saturday that she woke her two children up early at 7:30 a.m. to tell them of the news that their father had been released. “They were shocked,” she said. “You can probably hear them now, jumping up and down, asking ‘When are we going to see him?’ It’s been a time of rejoicing.” Naghmeh Abedini has been a high-profile advocate for her husband, posting updates on social media regularly and speaking regularly at Christian conferences across the country. Saeed Abedini had established small house churches in Iran, and he was convicted in 2013 of threatening Iran’s national security. Born and raised in Iran, Abedini became a U.S. citizen in 2010. In July 2012, he visited the country of Georgia, and when he tried to enter Iran to see his parents, his passport was taken and he was put under house arrest, then later imprisoned in September, his wife said. In November, Naghmeh Abedini began to back away from her high-profile role in the campaign, telling supporters by email that her husband had been abusive to her and she can “no longer live a lie.” Christianity Today published two emails Naghmeh Abedini sent to supporters about her troubled marriage, which began in 2004. She confirmed that she had experienced “physical, emotional, psychological, and sexual abuse through her husband’s addiction to pornography.” She wrote at the time, “The abuse started early in their marriage and has worsened during Saeed’s imprisonment,” which she confirmed on Saturday. The two had been speaking by phone and through Skype, but she said she has not spoken with him since October. She said the timing of those emails, which were leaked to media, was unfortunate. “When he gets home, we can address the serious issues that have happened and continued,” she said. [Previously: Citing abuse, wife of U.S. pastor held in Iran says she’ll stop public campaigning] She said her husband will undergo a medical examination and they can assess his physical and emotional state. She said he had been beaten and interrogated when he was first imprisoned and suffered internal bleeding, but she does not know his current physical condition. Abedini said that once they leave Iranian soil, they will discuss if she will fly and meet him somewhere or if they will meet when he returns to the U.S. Abedini, who attends the nondenominational Calvary Chapel in Boise, said it’s unclear whether her husband will continue to be a pastor, though it’s always been “his heart.” “I think he would have to deal with a lot of issues,” she said. “There will need to be a time of healing for him and his family.” Details of her abuse will eventually have to be addressed within the evangelical community, where she has been a prominent spokesperson for international religious freedom, said Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. “I dont think today is the day to address that,” he said. “I was stunned and surprised by Naghmeh’s statement. I did not know any of that. It was and is very troubling.” Saeed Abedini’s release was part of the nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers in which Iran agreed to an exchange for at least six people imprisoned or charged in the U.S. “I don’t generally believe in prisoner exchanges,” said Moore, who noted that he also opposes the nuclear deal. “That said, one can oppose of a plan and still rejoice in the release of prisoners of conscience.” Naghmeh Abedini said she has grown interested in religious persecution, not just of Christians but Sunni Muslims, Baha’is and others under threat in the Middle East. “As a Christian, I believe God gives freedom, including to be an atheist,” she said. “My husband has opened my eyes to the plight of people of different beliefs.” Naghmeh Abedini was born in Iran and moved to the U.S. with her parents when she was 9 and became a citizen when they did. She was working in project management for a manufacturing company when her husband was put in prison but left her job so she could travel and speak on her husband’s behalf. She said her faith has grown stronger since her husband was put in prison. “We’ve all learned to have peace no matter what came our way in the midst of ups and downs,” she said. “We’ve trusted God and his timing, and today was the timing.” In October, she wrote an op-ed letter to President Obama for The Washington Post in which she described the agony her family has faced, and said she had hoped that the nuclear deal would mean prisoners like her husband would be freed.

1,"The Post reported earlier Saturday, “Iran released Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian and three other detained Iranian Americans on Saturday in exchange for seven people imprisoned or charged in the United States, U.S. and Iranian officials said, a swap linked to the imminent implementation of a landmark nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers.” Relief in the return of our fellow citizens does not, however, equate to kudos to the administration. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) summed up the attitude of many Americans in his Saturday statement: Today the four Americans who have been unjustly held in in Iran are finally returning home and we welcome them with open arms. They and their families have been through unspeakable pain and suffering and their freedom brings relief to not only them, but the entire country. But in our elation over their safe return we must be careful not to forget the dangerous circumstances of their release. President Obama has appeased Iran’s terror-sponsoring ayatollahs, this time with a ‘prisoner’ swap to secure the overdue release of four innocent American hostages in return for which Iran gets seven lawfully convicted terrorists and criminals, fourteen terrorism prosecutions halted, $100 billion in sanctions relief, and an industrial-scale nuclear program—and Iran gets to keep Americans Siamak Namazi and Robert Levinson to extract future concessions.  While we exult in the return of American hostages, one must also wonder how many more Americans will be taken hostage in the future as a result of President Obama’s shameful decision to negotiate with these terrorists. The moral equivalency at the heart of the trade — convicted Iranian criminals for innocents unjustly held — is not new for this administration. “In the Alan Gross case, the Obama administration traded several Cuban spies to Castro for the release of an unjustly imprisoned USAID worker,” recalled former deputy national security adviser Elliott Abrams. “Here, unjustly imprisoned Americans are traded for Iranian criminals — and the U.S. agrees to stop trying to prosecute fourteen other Iranians engaged in arms trafficking. Our delight at the release of our fellow citizens has to be tempered by our understanding that evil regimes are learning it’s profitable to seize American hostages.” He further observed, ” When Ronald Reagan freed our hostages in 1980, he paid no price to Iran. We’ve come a long way since then — unfortunately.” Several of the GOP presidential candidates reacted with outrage. “This is not a guy I would let negotiate buying a car for me, let alone anything else. I mean, he makes bad deals and he seems to become an expert at making bad deals with the Iranians,” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said from the campaign trail in Iowa. “The fact is that we shouldn’t have to trade anything to get our citizens back home. They were taken illegally by a rogue regime of mullahs over in Iran, and this is the problem with this president, he gets no respect around the world. No respect. If we had a president who was respected around the world, we wouldn’t have these folks taken in the first place.” He too recalled that “as soon as Ronald Reagan took the Oath of Office, those Iranians returned our citizens immediately because they knew if they didn’t, they would have to face the strength of character and the wrath of Ronald Reagan.” Donald Trump declared, “It’s a disgrace they have been there for so long,” a sentiment echoed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). “If these reports are true, of course we’re happy for them and their families, but they should have never been there,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said. “The fact of the matter is that this tells us everything we need to know about the Iranian regime — that they take people hostage in order to gain concessions. And the fact that they can get away with it with this administration I think has created an incentive for more governments to do this around the world.” No American can be displeased with the release of our hostages, but neither should we be delighted with the administration. This is a crew that again and again gives up far more than seems reasonable or possible at the expense of U.S. interests. In doing so, these officials invite further outrages by Iran. “What it means is that decades of hostage-taking by the Iranian mullahs has show yet again to work,” remarks sanctions expert Mark Dubowitz. “We should expect more more hostage taking of Americans.” It is for that reason that a new commander in chief is so badly needed.","The Post reported earlier Saturday, “Iran released Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian and three other detained Iranian Americans on Saturday in exchange for seven people imprisoned or charged in the United States, U.S. and Iranian officials said, a swap linked to the imminent implementation of a landmark nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers.” Relief in the return of our fellow citizens does not, however, equate to kudos to the administration.

0,"The last time Democrats met on a debate stage, it was a Saturday before Christmas, and we wrote that Hillary Clinton was sitting comfortably atop the field. Now, as Democrats get ready to debate for a fourth time, in South Carolina on Sunday -- in the middle of a three-day holiday weekend -- there are signs Clinton's lead is evaporating. A Quinnipiac University poll out Tuesday shows her rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ahead in Iowa by five points. A Selzer & Company poll showed Clinton up just two -- down from wider previous leads. It's all raising questions among Democratic elite whether Clinton's once-seemingly inevitable nomination will slip away from her like it did in 2008. It's notable that Clinton still has a tactical advantage since the national debate has shifted away from economic issues and zeroed in on national security and terrorism -- especially with news Saturday that Iran freed four Americans, including The Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, in a deal that provided clemency for seven Iranians charged or imprisoned in the U.S. for sanctions violations. A December Washington Post-ABC News poll showed more than 3 in 5 voters trust her more than her opponents to handle issues related to terrorism and national security. But her main opponent has found ways to chip away at that, too. As the Democratic primary gets more muddied than most would have predicted, here are the eight top issues for Sunday's Democratic debate. 1. The U.S.-Iran prisoner deal World leaders were converging in Vienna on Saturday to prepare to lift sanctions against Iran as part of a historic nuclear deal, when news broke that four Americans imprisoned in Iran would be freed. The four include a Christian pastor, a former Marine and Rezaian, who had been in captivity in Iran for 18 months and was most recently held in the country's notorious Evin Prison. In exchange, the U.S. released the seven Iranians imprisoned or charged related to violating sanctions against Iran. A U.S. official in Vienna told The Post that no Iranians charged with crimes related to terrorism were freed. Upon news of the exchange, most Republican presidential candidates immediately criticized the Obama administration. Some, like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said the deal sets a bad precedent for future relations. Others, like Ben Carson, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), praised parts or all of the prisoner release while still offering harsh words for the nuclear deal Obama and five other nations signed with Iran in 2015. Democratic presidential candidates appeared to have a different take on the news. In a statement Saturday, Sanders said the exchange shows ""diplomacy can work."" Late Saturday, Clinton issued a statement welcoming the release, but adding, “We shouldn’t thank Iran for the prisoners or for following through on its obligations. These prisoners were held unjustly by a regime that continues to threaten the peace and security of the Middle East.” All three Democratic candidates will have a chance to offer more thoughts on the complicated U.S.-Iran relationship -- and its latest development -- on Sunday night. 2. Sanders's general election viability Sanders's momentum is raising the possibility among the Democratic elite in Washington that the socialist who wants to give all Americans Medicare, provide tuition-free public college, break up the big banks and tax the heck out of Wall Street actually has a shot at winning the nomination. The Washington Post's Paul Kane notes that many of Sanders's proposals go beyond the Democratic Party's official agenda and are far to the left of the nation as a whole. But Sanders's success so far could be offered up as proof that the socialist's ideas are being embraced by a growing populist -- and even socialist -- wing of the party. (A new Seltzer & Co. Iowa poll found that more Iowa Democratic voters identify as ""socialist"" than ""capitalist."") Clinton and the Democratic establishment are trying to make the case that Sanders is too far left to be the party's standard-bearer in November. But Kane reports they're trying to tread carefully so as not to alienate Sanders's growing voter base. The question Sanders must answer is whether he's got a broad enough umbrella to be the party's nominee. Even though Sanders is giving Clinton a run for her money in Iowa and practically has home-state advantage in the next contest, New Hampshire, he has struggled to connect with blacks and Hispanics, who are big in the third and fourth early-voting states, South Carolina and Nevada. Will his standard pitch that the billionaire class is taking over America be enough? So far it's worked out pretty well for him. 3. Benghazi and the '13 Hours' movie It's back. Director Michael Bay's movie about the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including a U.S. ambassador, came out in theaters on Friday. The movie is based on a book written in collaboration by surviving members of the CIA's security team, and already there's no shortage of controversy about what it portrays. In an interview with The Post's Adam Goldman and Greg Miller, the former CIA officer in charge of Benghazi that night disputes the movie's storyline, saying one of the most pivotal moments in the film -- a CIA order to “stand down” rather than rush off to rescue U.S. diplomats a mile away -- never happened. Whether fact or fiction, the action-packed drama actually avoids politicizing the incident, writes Post reviewer Michael O'Sullivan. But Clinton, who was secretary of state during the time and whose response afterward has consistently been called into questions by conservatives, is being done no favors by having a re-telling of that deadly night brought to life for Americans less than three weeks for the first votes in the race are cast. Even if you don't think Clinton did anything wrong with regard to Benghazi, it's clearly not helpful to have it front-and-center again. 4. National security This is Clinton's strong suit, and it's a topic she's dominated in the past three debates. As she balances how to come across as hawkish as possible with a base that is increasingly worried about terrorism but also wary of military intervention in the Middle East, Clinton has not recommended undoing or  changing in a major way any of President Obama's efforts to prevent the flow of would-be fighters to the Islamic State. Sanders has struggled to match Clinton's intensity on national security and terrorism, preferring to talk about his bread-and-butter issue of economic inequality. But that doesn't mean Clinton is immune to attacks from her challengers. Sanders tried to get a leg up in December's ABC debate by questioning Clinton's decision to support regime change in the Middle East while she was secretary of state. 5. Islamic State and terrorism When Democrats gathered for their November debate, they were one day removed from the Paris attacks. The candidates got the chance to offer their solutions for how to counter the rising threat of the Islamic State and, most notably, Clinton not-so-subtly rebuked Obama's comments that the Islamic State had been ""contained."" When they debated again in December, the Islamic State-linked mass shooting at a holiday office party in San Bernardino, Calif., was still part of the national conversation. Each time, Clinton has tried to pivot to general election mode, going out of her way to criticize GOP candidates' prescriptions for rising fears of terrorism. She has had harsh words for Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Tex.) suggestion to ""carpet bomb"" the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigrants from the country. ""Bluster and bigotry are not credentials"" to be commander in chief, she said in a speech Tuesday at the University of Minnesota. But the GOP's tough talk makes political  sense in light of Obama's approval ratings on terrorism and the Islamic State, which are at at record lows, according to Washington Post-ABC News poll taken after the Paris attacks. Clinton is doing her best to draw a contrast with her former boss, but in a plan she outlined in November, she offered few major changes on what to do militarily in Iraq and Syria. 6. Gun control Polls consistently show that as many as 90 percent of Americans support at least expanding background checks, but a majority of Americans are doubtful that changing gun laws will help prevent gun violence. In other words, it's complicated. Clinton has staked out a position on gun control to the left of her 2008 presidential campaign;  she recently called for a renewal of the federal ban on so-called assault weapons. Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley has one of the strictest gun control platforms in the race: He wants to ban assault weapons and require that every person who buys a gun acquire a license and get fingerprinted. Addressing gun control proved to be a struggle for Sanders in the first debate, as Clinton attacked him for a voting record she said looks more like and NRA supporter. (Sanders says he was representing his rural, Vermont community, which remains very pro-gun rights.) He specifically came under fire for voting for a 2005 law that gives gun manufacturers legal immunity from damages their guns might cause. On Saturday night, Sanders said he would be open to a bill introduced in the Senate to reverse some key parts of the law. ""As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up,"" Sanders said in a statement. But how much the candidates can do on gun safety is an open question. Congress has failed to pass any gun control reforms. A proposal to ban terrorism suspects on a secretive no-fly list from being able to buy guns -- and one to expand background checks -- failed in the Senate one day after the San Bernardino shooting. 7. Climate change and energy Democratic presidential candidates agree the government needs to step in to help stop climate change and invest in more clean energy, and all three candidates cheered a historic, 196-country agreement reached in Paris to try to limit the Earth's warming by 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The litmus test among environmentalists has long been whether or not candidates would approve the fourth stage of the Keystone pipeline to ship Canadian oil to Nebraska, a politically touchy point for Clinton who recently said she opposes the pipeline but not before wavering for months. Obama took that test off the table in November when he announced he wouldn't approve the pipeline. Clinton has now shifted her focus to trying to invest in coal communities hit by a shift to clean energy: Before Democrats' November debate, she unveiled a $30 billion infrastructure and tax-break plan to do just that. Sanders and O'Malley regularly talk about how climate change is one of America's most pressing problems as well. 8. Clinton's ties to Wall Street On Sunday, The Boston Globe published a story saying that while a U.S. senator from New York, Clinton rarely signed onto bills related to the financial services industry -- regardless of whether banks in her district and those donating to her campaign supported or opposed the legislation. Sanders immediately pivoted off that story to criticize his opponent as too weak on Wall Street. Breaking up the big banks, taxing Wall Street and adding more regulations to the financial world forms the nucleus of Sanders's populist campaign. ""Cutting it out is not good enough,"" Sanders said Sunday on CBS's ""Face The Nation,"" making a reference to when Clinton in 2007 told big banks to ""cut it out."" Clinton, meanwhile, is trying to distance herself from Wall Street  -- saying Sunday she took more contributions from teachers than bankers.","The last time Democrats met on a debate stage, it was a Saturday before Christmas, and we wrote that Hillary Clinton was sitting comfortably atop the field.

The question Sanders must answer is whether he's got a broad enough umbrella to be the party's nominee. Even though Sanders is giving Clinton a run for her money in Iowa and practically has home-state advantage in the next contest, New Hampshire, he has struggled to connect with blacks and Hispanics, who are big in the third and fourth early-voting states, South Carolina and Nevada. Will his standard pitch that the billionaire class is taking over America be enough? So far it's worked out pretty well for him. 3. Benghazi and the '13 Hours' movie It's back. Director Michael Bay's movie about the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including a U.S. ambassador, came out in theaters on Friday. The movie is based on a book written in collaboration by surviving members of the CIA's security team, and already there's no shortage of controversy about what it portrays. In an interview with The Post's Adam Goldman and Greg Miller, the former CIA officer in charge of Benghazi that night disputes the movie's storyline, saying one of the most pivotal moments in the film -- a CIA order to “stand down” rather than rush off to rescue U.S. diplomats a mile away -- never happened. Whether fact or fiction, the action-packed drama actually avoids politicizing the incident, writes Post reviewer Michael O'Sullivan. But Clinton, who was secretary of state during the time and whose response afterward has consistently been called into questions by conservatives, is being done no favors by having a re-telling of that deadly night brought to life for Americans less than three weeks for the first votes in the race are cast. Even if you don't think Clinton did anything wrong with regard to Benghazi, it's clearly not helpful to have it front-and-center again. 4. National security This is Clinton's strong suit, and it's a topic she's dominated in the past three debates. As she balances how to come across as hawkish as possible with a base that is increasingly worried about terrorism but also wary of military intervention in the Middle East, Clinton has not recommended undoing or  changing in a major way any of President Obama's efforts to prevent the flow of would-be fighters to the Islamic State. Sanders has struggled to match Clinton's intensity on national security and terrorism, preferring to talk about his bread-and-butter issue of economic inequality. But that doesn't mean Clinton is immune to attacks from her challengers. Sanders tried to get a leg up in December's ABC debate by questioning Clinton's decision to support regime change in the Middle East while she was secretary of state. 5. Islamic State and terrorism When Democrats gathered for their November debate, they were one day removed from the Paris attacks. The candidates got the chance to offer their solutions for how to counter the rising threat of the Islamic State and, most notably, Clinton not-so-subtly rebuked Obama's comments that the Islamic State had been ""contained."" When they debated again in December, the Islamic State-linked mass shooting at a holiday office party in San Bernardino, Calif., was still part of the national conversation. Each time, Clinton has tried to pivot to general election mode, going out of her way to criticize GOP candidates' prescriptions for rising fears of terrorism. She has had harsh words for Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Tex.) suggestion to ""carpet bomb"" the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigrants from the country. ""Bluster and bigotry are not credentials"" to be commander in chief, she said in a speech Tuesday at the University of Minnesota. But the GOP's tough talk makes political  sense in light of Obama's approval ratings on terrorism and the Islamic State, which are at at record lows, according to Washington Post-ABC News poll taken after the Paris attacks. Clinton is doing her best to draw a contrast with her former boss, but in a plan she outlined in November, she offered few major changes on what to do militarily in Iraq and Syria. 6. Gun control Polls consistently show that as many as 90 percent of Americans support at least expanding background checks, but a majority of Americans are doubtful that changing gun laws will help prevent gun violence. In other words, it's complicated. Clinton has staked out a position on gun control to the left of her 2008 presidential campaign;  she recently called for a renewal of the federal ban on so-called assault weapons. Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley has one of the strictest gun control platforms in the race: He wants to ban assault weapons and require that every person who buys a gun acquire a license and get fingerprinted. Addressing gun control proved to be a struggle for Sanders in the first debate, as Clinton attacked him for a voting record she said looks more like and NRA supporter. (Sanders says he was representing his rural, Vermont community, which remains very pro-gun rights.) He specifically came under fire for voting for a 2005 law that gives gun manufacturers legal immunity from damages their guns might cause. On Saturday night, Sanders said he would be open to a bill introduced in the Senate to reverse some key parts of the law. ""As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up,"" Sanders said in a statement. But how much the candidates can do on gun safety is an open question. Congress has failed to pass any gun control reforms. A proposal to ban terrorism suspects on a secretive no-fly list from being able to buy guns -- and one to expand background checks -- failed in the Senate one day after the San Bernardino shooting. 7. Climate change and energy Democratic presidential candidates agree the government needs to step in to help stop climate change and invest in more clean energy, and all three candidates cheered a historic, 196-country agreement reached in Paris to try to limit the Earth's warming by 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The litmus test among environmentalists has long been whether or not candidates would approve the fourth stage of the Keystone pipeline to ship Canadian oil to Nebraska, a politically touchy point for Clinton who recently said she opposes the pipeline but not before wavering for months. Obama took that test off the table in November when he announced he wouldn't approve the pipeline. Clinton has now shifted her focus to trying to invest in coal communities hit by a shift to clean energy: Before Democrats' November debate, she unveiled a $30 billion infrastructure and tax-break plan to do just that. Sanders and O'Malley regularly talk about how climate change is one of America's most pressing problems as well. 8. Clinton's ties to Wall Street On Sunday, The Boston Globe published a story saying that while a U.S. senator from New York, Clinton rarely signed onto bills related to the financial services industry -- regardless of whether banks in her district and those donating to her campaign supported or opposed the legislation. Sanders immediately pivoted off that story to criticize his opponent as too weak on Wall Street. Breaking up the big banks, taxing Wall Street and adding more regulations to the financial world forms the nucleus of Sanders's populist campaign. ""Cutting it out is not good enough,"" Sanders said Sunday on CBS's ""Face The Nation,"" making a reference to when Clinton in 2007 told big banks to ""cut it out."" Clinton, meanwhile, is trying to distance herself from Wall Street  -- saying Sunday she took more contributions from teachers than bankers."
1,"On Sunday, President Obama addressed the implementation of the nuclear deal and the release of four Iranian-Americans from the Cabinet Room in the White House.  This is a good day, because, once again, we’re seeing what’s possible with strong American diplomacy. As I said in my State of the Union address, ensuring the security of the United States and the safety of our people demands a smart, patient and disciplined approach to the world.  That includes our diplomacy with the Islamic Republic of Iran.  For decades, our differences with Iran meant that our governments almost never spoke to each other.  Ultimately, that did not advance America’s interests.  Over the years, Iran moved closer and closer to having the ability to build a nuclear weapon.  But from Presidents Franklin Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan, the United States has never been afraid to pursue diplomacy with our adversaries.  And as President, I decided that a strong, confident America could advance our national security by engaging directly with the Iranian government. We’ve seen the results.  Under the nuclear deal that we, our allies and partners reached with Iran last year, Iran will not get its hands on a nuclear bomb.  The region, the United States, and the world will be more secure.  As I’ve said many times, the nuclear deal was never intended to resolve all of our differences with Iran.  But still, engaging directly with the Iranian government on a sustained basis, for the first time in decades, has created a unique opportunity -- a window -- to try to resolve important issues.  And today, I can report progress on a number of fronts. First, yesterday marked a milestone in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  Iran has now fulfilled key commitments under the nuclear deal.  And I want to take a moment to explain why this is so important. Over more than a decade, Iran had moved ahead with its nuclear program, and, before the deal, it had installed nearly 20,000 centrifuges that can enrich uranium for a nuclear bomb.  Today, Iran has removed two-thirds of those machines.  Before the deal, Iran was steadily increasing its stockpile of enriched uranium -- enough for up to 10 nuclear bombs.  Today, more than 98 percent of that stockpile has been shipped out of Iran -- meaning Iran now doesn’t have enough material for even one bomb. Before, Iran was nearing completion of a new reactor capable of producing plutonium for a bomb.  Today, the core of that reactor has been pulled out and filled with concrete so it cannot be used again. Before the deal, the world had relatively little visibility into Iran’s nuclear program.  Today, international inspectors are on the ground, and Iran is being subjected to the most comprehensive, intrusive inspection regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program.  Inspectors will monitor Iran’s key nuclear facilities 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  For decades to come, inspectors will have access to Iran’s entire nuclear supply chain.  In other words, if Iran tries to cheat -- if they try to build a bomb covertly -- we will catch them. So the bottom line is this.  Whereas Iran was steadily expanding its nuclear program, we have now cut off every single path that Iran could have used to build a bomb.  Whereas it would have taken Iran two to three months to break out with enough material to rush to a bomb, we’ve now extended that breakout time to a year -- and with the world’s unprecedented inspections and access to Iran’s program, we’ll know if Iran ever tries to break out. Now that Iran’s actions have been verified, it can begin to receive relief from certain nuclear sanctions and gain access to its own money that had been frozen.  And perhaps most important of all, we’ve achieved this historic progress through diplomacy, without resorting to another war in the Middle East. I want to also point out that by working with Iran on this nuclear deal, we were better able to address other issues.  When our sailors in the Persian Gulf accidentally strayed into Iranian waters that could have sparked a major international incident.  Some folks here in Washington rushed to declare that it was the start of another hostage crisis.  Instead, we worked directly with the Iranian government and secured the release of our sailors in less than 24 hours. This brings me to a second major development -- several Americans unjustly detained by Iran are finally coming home.  In some cases, these Americans faced years of continued detention.  And I’ve met with some of their families.  I’ve seen their anguish, how they ache for their sons and husbands.  I gave these families my word -- I made a vow -- that we would do everything in our power to win the release of their loved ones.  And we have been tireless.  On the sidelines of the nuclear negotiations, our diplomats at the highest level, including Secretary Kerry, used every meeting to push Iran to release our Americans.  I did so myself, in my conversation with President Rouhani.  After the nuclear deal was completed, the discussions between our governments accelerated.  Yesterday, these families finally got the news that they have been waiting for. Jason Rezaian is coming home.  A courageous journalist for The Washington Post, who wrote about the daily lives and hopes of the Iranian people, he’s been held for a year and a half.  He embodies the brave spirit that gives life to the freedom of the press.  Jason has already been reunited with his wife and mom. Pastor Saeed Abedini is coming home.  Held for three and half years, his unyielding faith has inspired people around the world in the global fight to uphold freedom of religion.  Now, Pastor Abedini will return to his church and community in Idaho. Amir Hekmati is coming home.  A former sergeant in the Marine Corps, he’s been held for four and a half years.  Today, his parents and sisters are giving thanks in Michigan. Two other Americans unjustly detained by Iran have also been released -- Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari and Matthew Trevithick, an Iranian -- who was in Iran as a student.  Their cases were largely unknown to the world.  But when Americans are freed and reunited with their families, that’s something that we can all celebrate. So I want to thank my national security team -- especially Secretary Kerry; Susan Rice, my National Security Advisor; Brett McGurk; Avril Haines; Ben Rhodes -- our whole team worked tirelessly to bring our Americans home, to get this work done.  And I want to thank the Swiss government, which represents our interests in Iran, for their critical assistance. And meanwhile, Iran has agreed to deepen our coordination as we work to locate Robert Levinson -- missing from Iran for more than eight years.  Even as we rejoice in the safe return of others, we will never forget about Bob.  Each and every day, but especially today, our hearts are with the Levinson family, and we will not rest until their family is whole again. In a reciprocal humanitarian gesture, six Iranian–Americans and one Iranian serving sentences or awaiting trial in the United States are being granted clemency.  These individuals were not charged with terrorism or any violent offenses.  They’re civilians, and their release is a one-time gesture to Iran given the unique opportunity offered by this moment and the larger circumstances at play.  And it reflects our willingness to engage with Iran to advance our mutual interests, even as we ensure the national security of the United States. So, nuclear deal implemented.  American families reunited.  The third piece of this work that we got done this weekend involved the United States and Iran resolving a financial dispute that dated back more than three decades.  Since 1981, after our nations severed diplomatic relations, we’ve worked through a international tribunal to resolve various claims between our countries.  The United States and Iran are now settling a longstanding Iranian government claim against the United States government.  Iran will be returned its own funds, including appropriate interest, but much less than the amount Iran sought. For the United States, this settlement could save us billions of dollars that could have been pursued by Iran.  So there was no benefit to the United States in dragging this out.  With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well. Of course, even as we implement the nuclear deal and welcome our Americans home, we recognize that there remain profound differences between the United States and Iran.  We remain steadfast in opposing Iran’s destabilizing behavior elsewhere, including its threats against Israel and our Gulf partners, and its support for violent proxies in places like Syria and Yemen.  We still have sanctions on Iran for its violations of human rights, for its support of terrorism, and for its ballistic missile program.  And we will continue to enforce these sanctions, vigorously.  Iran’s recent missile test, for example, was a violation of its international obligations.  And as a result, the United States is imposing sanctions on individuals and companies working to advance Iran’s ballistic missile program.  And we are going to remain vigilant about it.  We're not going to waver in the defense of our security or that of our allies and partners. But I do want to once again speak directly to the Iranian people.  Yours is a great civilization, with a vibrant culture that has so much to contribute to the world -- in commerce, and in science and the arts.  For decades, your government’s threats and actions to destabilize your region have isolated Iran from much of the world.  And now our governments are talking with one another.  Following the nuclear deal, you -- especially young Iranians -- have the opportunity to begin building new ties with the world.  We have a rare chance to pursue a new path -- a different, better future that delivers progress for both our peoples and the wider world.  That’s the opportunity before the Iranian people.  We need to take advantage of that. And to my fellow Americans, today, we’re united in welcoming home sons and husbands and brothers who, in lonely prison cells, have endured an absolute nightmare.  But they never gave in and they never gave up.  At long last, they can stand tall and breathe deep the fresh air of freedom. As a nation, we face real challenges, around the world and here at home.  Many of them will not be resolved quickly or easily.  But today’s progress -- Americans coming home, an Iran that has rolled back its nuclear program and accepted unprecedented monitoring of that program -- these things are a reminder of what we can achieve when we lead with strength and with wisdom; with courage and resolve and patience.  America can do -- and has done -- big things when we work together.  We can leave this world and make it safer and more secure for our children and our grandchildren for generations to come. I want to thank once again Secretary Kerry; our entire national security team, led by Susan Rice.  I'm grateful for all the assistance that we received from our allies and partners.  And I am hopeful that this signals the opportunity at least for Iran to work more cooperatively with nations around the world to advance their interests and the interests of people who are looking for peace and security for their families. Thank you so much.  God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

0,"THE BIG IDEA: HOLLIS, N.H.—Jeb Bush has embraced with gusto his role as the anti-Trump. The once-presumed Republican frontrunner, now often an afterthought, has more aggressively gone after The Donald in New Hampshire than any other candidate. Running on television here is a minute-long ad in which Bush explains that Trump is “a jerk” because he mocks people with disabilities. His stump speech is basically a rebuttal of Trumpism. He opened his 21st visit to the Granite State by decrying “grandiose talk” and then trying to channel some of what Trump has tapped into. Speaking about his two terms as governor of Florida, he declared: “I disrupted the order … It was a story of disruption.” Boasting about battling the teacher’s union, he said, “Talk about political incorrectness!” Wading into process, Bush makes the case to voters that Trump would never win a general election because he has alienated more than half the electorate, including women, Hispanics and ex-POWs. “If I’m the anti-Trump, I love that role,” he said, “because that’s who I am.” This assertiveness has won over some. When Lindsey Graham endorsed Bush last Friday, the South Carolina senator cited his willingness to challenge Trump’s proposal to temporarily halt all Muslim immigration. But Trump overshadows Bush everywhere he goes, making it significantly harder to convey the affirmative case for why people should support him. Even when his name was not mentioned, six of the 16 questions Bush fielded during a town hall in this suburb of Nashua over the long weekend boiled down to some variation of: What about Trump? A psychologist from Pennsylvania told Bush that Trump is a narcissist and a sociopath. “Doctor, thank you for the prescription,” Bush replied. “I appreciate it.” Someone else said the party is running out of time to stop Trump. Bush replied that he never expected him to be the frontrunner. “No, I’m not that smart,” he said. “I’m not a masochist. It doesn’t give me great joy” to go after him. It happened again the next day in Hampstead, when a young boy asked: “Why would you want to be the president of a nation that would consider voting for Trump?” Bush replied, “I don’t think Trump’s a reflection of the American people.” That’s when a dude in a Trump T-shirt began heckling him, according to the Union Leader. The man wanted to know why Bush had said he would not target the families of terrorists. “No president would allow for the killing of innocents as a designed strategy of the United States, my friend,” Bush shot back. “I don’t care what Donald Trump says.” Trump will almost certainly win New Hampshire. The real race is for runner-up. Bush correctly sees “a jump ball for second with five candidates.” One interesting dynamic I picked up on while interviewing voters who lean toward Bush is that they like him and loathe Trump. They think Bush would be a good president but sound willing to defect to someone else if they think that rival could stop the billionaire. That creates a danger that, assuming Bush finishes poorly in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, some of his supporters in New Hampshire might get behind another candidate in the establishment lane who is perceived to have momentum going into the Feb. 9 primary. (Marco Rubio or Chris Christie would appear to be the most likely beneficiaries of such a shift.) Trump’s attacks worked. He mostly ignores Bush now, but his attacks from the summer took a tangible toll on Jeb’s image. He had a negative favorability rating in the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll. Telephoned afterward, a striking number of respondents parroted the Trump lines of attack. Janet DeHart of Emlenton, Pa., said she loves both George Bushes. But this year, she won’t support Jeb. “I just feel sometimes that I have more zip at 81 than he does,” DeHart told The Post’s Ed O’Keefe. “What did Donald say? He’s ‘low-energy.’ It’s exactly right. It looks like he needs someone to walk up from behind him and give him a little nudge.” In fact, Jeb is not low energy on the stump. He has always been strong at one-on-one interactions and has improved significantly in the town hall format, but he remains poor at debates and giving sound bites. In a nationalized race, those weaknesses matter most. So the false narrative has stuck. One problem for Jeb in the current climate is that he does not project the certitude of his rivals. Asked in Hollis, for example, if he would have swapped five Taliban prisoners in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, Bush firmly answered “no.” Then he paused. “I don’t know,” he said, turning the answer into a maybe. He explained that he does not have all the facts. “You’ve got to be careful about what you say,” he said. “But based on what I know, no.” After the Paris attacks, the Bush campaign argued that his standing would improve because voters would suddenly be looking for someone thoughtful about foreign policy.

Trump took extreme risks in a shaky economy, leveraged the Taj deal with high-cost debt, and ignored warnings that Atlantic City would not be able to attract enough gamblers to pay the bills, documents and interviews show. … Trump said his work on the Taj Mahal was ultimately successful and earned him a lot of money. He said the bankruptcy was the result of external forces beyond his control, specifically an extremely bad economy in 1990.

It’s not that Trump is the most religious or pious of the candidates, Falwell said, although he described Trump as a ‘servant leader’ who ‘lives a life of helping others, as Jesus taught.’ It’s that Trump is a savvy businessman who ‘speaks the truth publicly, even if it is uncomfortable for people to hear’ … “Some high-level evangelical leaders are baffled at why their colleagues and followers would embrace Trump.

Hunting wasn’t the problem — the hovercraft was. Even though Sturgeon had used his 10-foot rubber boat for years in the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, the officers pulled out the rulebook and said noisy hovercraft were banned in all national parks, even in Alaska. … His pique led to a lawsuit, and the lawsuit led to a surprising grant from the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court’s interest led to an outpouring of support that has startled the businessman and moose hunter. … The distinctly underwhelming question — were federal officials legally justified in enforcing the hovercraft ban in the Alaskan preserve? — was deemed by the federal government’s lawyers to be ‘not in itself one of surpassing significance.’ All agree that the answer lies in a statute that applies exclusively to the 49th state.” SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: — ZIGNAL VISUAL: Sanders continues to attract more attention than his Democratic rivals on Twitter, but Clinton is still the queen of the small screen.

The once-presumed Republican frontrunner, now often an afterthought, has more aggressively gone after The Donald in New Hampshire than any other candidate. Running on television here is a minute-long ad in which Bush explains that Trump is “a jerk” because he mocks people with disabilities. His stump speech is basically a rebuttal of Trumpism. He opened his 21st visit to the Granite State by decrying “grandiose talk” and then trying to channel some of what Trump has tapped into. Speaking about his two terms as governor of Florida, he declared: “I disrupted the order … It was a story of disruption.” Boasting about battling the teacher’s union, he said, “Talk about political incorrectness!” Wading into process, Bush makes the case to voters that Trump would never win a general election because he has alienated more than half the electorate, including women, Hispanics and ex-POWs. “If I’m the anti-Trump, I love that role,” he said, “because that’s who I am.” This assertiveness has won over some. When Lindsey Graham endorsed Bush last Friday, the South Carolina senator cited his willingness to challenge Trump’s proposal to temporarily halt all Muslim immigration. But Trump overshadows Bush everywhere he goes, making it significantly harder to convey the affirmative case for why people should support him. Even when his name was not mentioned, six of the 16 questions Bush fielded during a town hall in this suburb of Nashua over the long weekend boiled down to some variation of: What about Trump? A psychologist from Pennsylvania told Bush that Trump is a narcissist and a sociopath. “Doctor, thank you for the prescription,” Bush replied. “I appreciate it.” Someone else said the party is running out of time to stop Trump. Bush replied that he never expected him to be the frontrunner. “No, I’m not that smart,” he said. “I’m not a masochist. It doesn’t give me great joy” to go after him. It happened again the next day in Hampstead, when a young boy asked: “Why would you want to be the president of a nation that would consider voting for Trump?” Bush replied, “I don’t think Trump’s a reflection of the American people.” That’s when a dude in a Trump T-shirt began heckling him, according to the Union Leader. The man wanted to know why Bush had said he would not target the families of terrorists. “No president would allow for the killing of innocents as a designed strategy of the United States, my friend,” Bush shot back. “I don’t care what Donald Trump says.” Trump will almost certainly win New Hampshire. The real race is for runner-up. Bush correctly sees “a jump ball for second with five candidates.” One interesting dynamic I picked up on while interviewing voters who lean toward Bush is that they like him and loathe Trump. They think Bush would be a good president but sound willing to defect to someone else if they think that rival could stop the billionaire. That creates a danger that, assuming Bush finishes poorly in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, some of his supporters in New Hampshire might get behind another candidate in the establishment lane who is perceived to have momentum going into the Feb. 9 primary. (Marco Rubio or Chris Christie would appear to be the most likely beneficiaries of such a shift.) Trump’s attacks worked. He mostly ignores Bush now, but his attacks from the summer took a tangible toll on Jeb’s image. He had a negative favorability rating in the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll. Telephoned afterward, a striking number of respondents parroted the Trump lines of attack. Janet DeHart of Emlenton, Pa., said she loves both George Bushes. But this year, she won’t support Jeb. “I just feel sometimes that I have more zip at 81 than he does,” DeHart told The Post’s Ed O’Keefe. “What did Donald say? He’s ‘low-energy.’ It’s exactly right. It looks like he needs someone to walk up from behind him and give him a little nudge.” In fact, Jeb is not low energy on the stump. He has always been strong at one-on-one interactions and has improved significantly in the town hall format, but he remains poor at debates and giving sound bites. In a nationalized race, those weaknesses matter most. So the false narrative has stuck. One problem for Jeb in the current climate is that he does not project the certitude of his rivals. Asked in Hollis, for example, if he would have swapped five Taliban prisoners in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, Bush firmly answered “no.” Then he paused. “I don’t know,” he said, turning the answer into a maybe. He explained that he does not have all the facts. “You’ve got to be careful about what you say,” he said. “But based on what I know, no.” After the Paris attacks, the Bush campaign argued that his standing would improve because voters would suddenly be looking for someone thoughtful about foreign policy.

0,"THE BIG IDEA: — Sarah Palin’s endorsement of Donald Trump underscores something remarkable: Neither Trump nor Ted Cruz, the two Republicans leading in the polls, has the endorsement of a single sitting governor or senator. “It is staggering that Trump does not have a major elected official or any statewide elected officeholder anywhere in the country supporting him,” said former New Hampshire GOP chairman Fergus Cullen, who has not endorsed anyone. “People who actually win elections recognize he’d be a train wreck … but his supporters love that. And Cruz wears the lack of a single endorsement from a Senate colleague as a badge of honor.” — On the Democratic side, the entire political establishment of New Hampshire publicly lined up behind Hillary Clinton – including Gov. Maggie Hassan and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen – but Bernie Sanders’ lead in the state has grown into double digits. Even in Sanders’ home state, neighboring Vermont, the Democratic establishment – including Sen. Pat Leahy and Gov. Pete Shumlin – publicly backs Clinton. Yet Sanders has the state’s March 1 primary locked up. Liberal talk radio host Arnie Arnesen, once the Democratic nominee for governor in New Hampshire, thinks Clinton has struggled to change the perception that she typifies the status quo because of all the politicians who have endorsed her. “Now more than ever, endorsements don’t matter,” said Arnesen, who is officially neutral. “This is a year where everyone is really looking for someone who is prepared to change the conversation or change the landscape … Clinton will bring in the same people.” — A bunch of high-profile GOP endorsements in the Granite State scattered last year among the establishmentarians. Ex.-Sen. Judd Gregg, the scion of the storied political family, backed Jeb Bush. Former senators John E. Sununu and Gordon Humphrey backed John Kasich. John McCain, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2000 and 2008, went all in for his amigo Lindsey Graham – making several visits to the state before the South Carolina senator dropped out. On the other hand, even Cruz’s best friend in the Senate (and, frankly, one of his only friends in the chamber), Utah’s Mike Lee, is staying neutral. It is worth noting that Cruz has received endorsements from several House members, including Iowa’s Steve King, who represent deeply-conservative areas. Ken Buck blew a winnable 2010 Senate race in Colorado by running a disastrous campaign. In 2014, he got elected in a safely-Republican district. Yesterday, the Cruz campaign released a statement touting his endorsement. Joseph D. Kenney is a member of New Hampshire’s Executive Council, a powerful post that gives him some control over state spending. He has been courted by all the candidates. Chris Christie texts him. Heidi Cruz sat down with him last week. Carly Fiorina baffled him by repeatedly calling him “Joey.” Kenney’s wife prefers Marco Rubio, but at Scott Brown’s rally for Trump in Portsmouth this weekend he explained why he plans to stay neutral. “My endorsement is not going to mean really anything,” said Kenney, the 2008 GOP nominee for governor. “It’s different in local and state races. But presidential endorsements here don’t mean as much as they used to.” At that same Trump rally, before the Palin rollout, several rank-and-file voters told me they want someone who is not “tainted” by holding elected office. –Local press dutifully covers most endorsements, though, even when they are totally irrelevant. The Star-Ledger yesterday wrote, for example, about David Karnes endorsing Christie. He represented Nebraska in the Senate from 1987 to 1989. The truth is that this doesn’t matter. Ditto with Chuck Douglas, a one-term congressman from New Hampshire (1989-90), who formally backed Kasich yesterday. — Then there’s the anti-endorsement: Bob Dole said yesterday that Republicans would suffer “cataclysmic” and “wholesale losses” if Cruz wins the nomination. The former Senate leader argued that Trump would perform better in the general election and probably have better relations with Congress as president because “he’s kind of a deal-maker.” The comments, made to the New York Times, drew more attention than when Dole came out for Bush last year. And they came a day after Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, another fixture of the Republican establishment who is officially neutral, publicly said he wants Cruz to lose his state. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) has also previously expressed disdain for Cruz, but she’s stayed neutral ahead of the primary and kept a low profile because she faces a tough reelection battle this year and cannot afford to alienate his supporters. Dave Carney, a top GOP strategist in New Hampshire, said there are two kinds of endorsements. When a senator or a governor backs a candidate, it may prompt voters to give someone a second look or bring with it an organization to help field efforts. Then there’s the celebrity endorsement. When someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Oprah visits an early state, it helps build a crowd to hear the candidate make his pitch. Palin would be more in the latter category. “If you hate Washington and think everything there sucks, having Mitch McConnell endorse someone is not so good,” said Carney, who is unaligned in 2016. “If there’s anything we know for close to a fact this cycle, it’s that the status quo isn’t going to cut out.” — UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck, who has done research on the impact of endorsements, argues that they still matter a great deal and have not this year only because the establishment did not coalesce behind one contender early on. “It’s the power of the cumulative sum of all the endorsements,” she said. “It matters less who they are now than how many they are. … The pace of endorsements in 2016 has been slow. … If all the Republican governors came out tomorrow and said, ‘All of us are all in on Kasich,’ that would mean something. … They’re not doing what they could have done, and that’s why it’s not having any affect.” — In this climate, endorsements from activists can be more powerful than from elected officials. Iowa Republican National Committeeman Steve Scheffler thinks, for example, that Phyllis Schlafly’s support for Trump a few weeks ago was actually more consequential than Palin’s because the 91-year-old has a deep reservoir of credibility with social conservatives. He told Yahoo News that it sent the signal that “maybe it’s safe for them to go ahead and support Trump.” — A final factor: the endorsement process in the early states has become tragically transactional. It’s a poorly-kept secret that many prominent “activists” get compensated by the candidates they support to be “consultants.” Ex-Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorenson, for example, defected from Michele Bachmann to Ron Paul ahead of the 2012 caucuses in exchange for cash payments. Social conservative activist Sam Clovis withdrew his support for Rick Perry last year when he stopped being able to pay. Then he signed with Trump. Stories about this these kinds of deals, which abound, undercut the legitimacy of all endorsements in the minds of savvy voters. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: — The Obama administration will announce as early as today its plan to introduce new visa requirements for European travelers who are dual nationals of Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria, or who have visited any of these countries in the last five years, the Associated Press reports. “U.S. officials and congressional aides involved in discussions say the Homeland Security Department will outline how it will phase in the new rule, designed to make it harder for Europeans who have fought for the Islamic State to enter the United States.” — A fresh WBUR poll shows that Sanders and Kasich would benefit the most from a strong independent turnout in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9. One-third of independents in the state are undecided — and they don’t have to make their minds up about whether to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary until the day of the vote. But they’re poised to have a significant impact: among indies who’ve made up their mind, 29 percent plan to pull the opposite ballot from 2008, the last open presidential contest. Those who benefit the least from indies voting in their primary? Trump, Cruz and Clinton. — Vladimir Putin most likely personally approved the fatal poisoning of a former KGB operative-turned-U.K. intelligence agent at a London hotel, according to a new British report. (Griff Witte) — Militants attacked a police checkpoint in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and killed five policemen. (AP) GET SMART FAST: POWER PLAYERS IN THE NEWS: THE REPUBLICAN RACE– — Trump held a 20-point lead over Cruz in a New Hampshire poll from CNN and WMUR. Jeb and Marco tied for third with 10 percent. A Monmouth national poll put Trump in first with 36%, down from 41% last month. Cruz is second at 17%, up from 14% last month.  Rubio garners 11% support, similar to his 10% showing in December. Everyone else is in single digits. — Bush and Rubio have spent a combined $91 million via their campaigns and outside groups, according to SMG Delta. By comparison, Trump and Cruz have spent just over $8 million on ads. That’s an 11-to-1 ratio. (NBC’s Mark Murray has the full breakdown.) — Stat du jour: $22.5 million has now been spent on commercials attacking Rubio, according to a Rubio ally tracking the air war. The spots, largely from the Bush super PAC, have not taken a toll on his numbers. The breakdown is $8.3 million in Iowa, $7.4 million in New Hampshire and $2.6 million in South Carolina. — Last night in Hollis, N.H., Cruz invoked Dole’s comments that Trump would be a better president than him to make the case that the establishment is for Donald. “Right now the establishment is abandoning Marco Rubio,” said Cruz. “They’re making the assessment that Marco can’t win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Trump. We’re seeing that every day. And Mr. Trump is welcoming the support of the Washington establishment.” (David Weigel) — A group calling itself Americans United for Values is running attack ads in Iowa that call Cruz “a false prophet,” per Politico. — Senior aides to Cruz say they have no plans to go after Trump on television, the New York Times reports. — In Tulsa, Palin managed to connect her son Track’s arrest for domestic violence to Obama’s record on veterans issues. “When my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate to the families who…feel these ramifications of PTSD,” she told the rowdy crowd of around 8,000 people. “And it makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of America’s finest that we have a commander-in-chief who will respect them.” (Jose A. DelReal) — Mark Levin has turned ice cold on Trump. Last night, the conservative radio host said The Donald is “Nixonian,” running an “Alinskyite” campaign and lying about Cruz’s loans from Goldman. “If he becomes the nominee, a lot of people who otherwise would unite under that tent may not, because when you run a campaign of personal attacks, an Alinskyite campaign, wittingly or unwittingly, you turn people off.” (Mediaite has the audio from his show.) — Last night in Keene, N.H., Jeb blasted Rubio and Cruz for being “all over the map” on national security, including Syria. (Watch) SANDERS VS. CLINTON– — Leading voices in the Democratic Party, including Planned Parenthood and the Human Right Campaign, slammed Sanders – for describing them as part of the Democratic establishment. “I was somewhat confused when Senator Sanders said, ‘Well, you know Planned Parenthood and the Human Right’s Campaign, they’re part of the establishment and that’s why they’re supporting Hillary Clinton because it’s all part of the establishment,'” Clinton said in Iowa last night. “I thought, boy I wish it were.” (Abby Phillip) — Dueling ads:  The Clinton campaign launched a 60-second spot in the first two states touting Hillary’s experience, perspective and toughness: Sanders launched his first commercial focused entirely on foreign policy. He makes the case that Clinton has experience but his judgment is solid. He promises he would “defend this nation but … do it responsibly.” He also says that ISIS must be destroyed but that “we should not do it alone.” (He also went up with a spot in Iowa highlighting his opposition to the Bakken oil pipeline, which Clinton has declined to take a position on.) — The Post’s Fact Checker this morning throws cold water on Sanders’ claims that he lost a 1988 House race because he supported an assault weapons ban: “”The evidence is mixed. He could have just as easily lost the election because he split votes with a Democrat, as opposed to being the only candidate without an NRA endorsement. In 1990, even Sanders was less sure that his failure to get an NRA endorsement two years prior was a major factor in his loss (‘It might have been. We don’t know. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t.’) Somewhere between 1990 and 2016, Sanders seems to have decided it’s played a bigger role than he originally thought.” (Michelle Ye Hee Lee) — Sanders ramps up preparations for Super Tuesday: The campaign has deployed about 50 paid campaign aides apiece to Nevada and South Carolina, the two states after New Hampshire. And paid staffers are now on the ground in all of the 11 states that have contests on March 1. “The preparations are part of an effort to buck what has emerged as the latest conventional wisdom surrounding the Democratic contest: that even if Clinton loses the first two contests, her superior campaign infrastructure and other advantages — including the demographics of the electorate — will allow her to overpower Sanders in subsequent states,” John Wagner and Abby Phillip report. — Nevada’s most powerful union, the Culinary Union, will NOT endorse before the caucuses there. The L.A. Times recalls how the group backed Obama in 2008, earning the ire of Bill Clinton and then saw Clinton carry the state any way, showing the limits of their juice. — The Clinton campaign’s Q1 fundraising goal is $50 million. BuzzFeed reports that top officials spent four-and-a-half hours with Latino donors earlier this week, trying to get them to step up. But they want commitments that cash they raise will be spent on outreach to their community. WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: — “Progressive hero or political doofus? Why Bill de Blasio has fallen in the polls,” by Paul Schwartzman in New York: “Two years ago, de Blasio’s victory as an unrepentant progressive in the nation’s most-populous city was evidence of the electorate’s shift to the left … Yet, midway through his term, de Blasio, 54, is buffeted by sagging poll numbers and rebukes from an ever-clamorous spectrum of New Yorkers. Allies on the left complain he’s not progressive enough. Editorial writers deride him as more dreamer than manager. … The mayor’s problem is not his progressive message. It’s the mayor himself, the way he talks, executes his policies and presides over the city.” — “New evidence suggests a ninth planet lurking at the edge of the solar system,” by Joel Achenbach and Rachel Feltman: “Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology announced Wednesday that they have found new evidence of a giant icy planet lurking in the darkness of our solar system far beyond the orbit of Pluto. They are calling it ‘Planet Nine.’ Their paper, published in the Astronomical Journal, estimates the planet’s mass as five to 10 times that of the Earth. But the authors, astronomers Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have not observed the planet directly. … Telescopes on at least two continents are searching for the object, which on average is 20 times farther away than the eighth planet, Neptune. If “Planet Nine” exists, it’s big – about two to four times the diameter of the Earth, which would make it the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. But at such extreme distances, it would reflect so little sunlight that it could evade even the most powerful telescopes.”  SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: –Pictures of the day: Space flowers are the coolest.

Rehnquist’s clerks in the 1996 term, became known at the court for his signature writing style. Nearly two decades later, his colleagues recall how Mr. Cruz, who frequently spoke of how his mentor’s father had been killed by a carjacker, often dwelled on the lurid details of murders that other clerks tended to summarize before quickly moving to the legal merits of the case. … In interviews with nearly two dozen of Mr. Cruz’s former colleagues on the court, many of the clerks working in the chambers of liberal justices, but also several from conservative chambers, depicted Mr. Cruz as ‘obsessed’ with capital punishment. … In Mr. Cruz’s time as a Supreme Court clerk, a coveted step in a legal career that he had meticulously plotted out, he showed his now familiar capacity to infuriate colleagues.” It is, indeed, remarkable how many went on the record to criticize him two decades later. If you need more Cruz, read The New Republic profile of campaign manager Jeff Roe here. — Marshall Project, “Is Charles Koch a closet liberal?”, by Bill Keller: “Not hardly. But he’s for rolling back the war on drugs, ending mass incarceration, and letting former convicts vote.” Koch Industries General Counsel Mark Holden explains that Charles Koch prefers to be described as “a classical liberal” more than a “libertarian.” Holden adds that, “the term ‘libertarian’ can have many different meanings and interpretations, including those who believe in no government, no national defense, and/or extreme individualism above all else and at the expense of others.” — Bloomberg, “What kind of man spends millions to elect Ted Cruz?” by Zachary Mider: “So far, Robert Mercer is the biggest single donor in the race. Working with his daughter Rebekah, he’s spent tens of millions more to advance a conservative agenda, investing in think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation, the media outlet Breitbart.com, and Cambridge Analytica, a data company that builds psychological profiles of voters. Groups he funds have attacked the science of global warming, published a book critical of Hillary Clinton, and bankrolled a documentary celebrating Ayn Rand. … Some allies privately say they think he’s pro-life and opposed to gay marriage, and others say the opposite. Republican operatives gossip about what little scraps of information they can glean—his theatrical Christmas galas [and] his habit of whistling to himself during business meetings.” — The Atlantic, “How Palin created Trump,” by Molly Ball: “Like no one else before Trump, Palin saw a constituency on the right for a politics of resentment that sought as its champion a pure agent of chaos, unfettered by positive or substantive views. … She tapped a vein of previously unheralded biker-bar conservatism that has lain dormant ever since, waiting for Trump to speak to it. Alienated from both parties, Palin proceeded to find a home in the then-nascent organs of the GOP fever swamps … In 2011, a right-wing filmmaker named Stephen Bannon made an adulatory movie about Palin, ‘The Undefeated’; he went on to become executive chairman of Breitbart.com, the website that has served as Trump’s most loyal cheering section. Palin’s people are Trump’s people.” — Americans are skeptical that any of the 2016 candidates would be great as president. The Pew Research Center conducted a national survey this month of 2,009 adults and found that 35% of voters say that Hillary would make either a good or great president, while 28% said she would be terrible; 31% say Trump would be either a good or great president; 11% say he would be great. 52% think Trump would make a poor or terrible president, with 38% saying he would be terrible. 30% say Sanders would be either a good or great president, while 35% say he would be poor or terrible.

Iowa Republican National Committeeman Steve Scheffler thinks, for example, that Phyllis Schlafly’s support for Trump a few weeks ago was actually more consequential than Palin’s because the 91-year-old has a deep reservoir of credibility with social conservatives. He told Yahoo News that it sent the signal that “maybe it’s safe for them to go ahead and support Trump.” — A final factor: the endorsement process in the early states has become tragically transactional. It’s a poorly-kept secret that many prominent “activists” get compensated by the candidates they support to be “consultants.” Ex-Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorenson, for example, defected from Michele Bachmann to Ron Paul ahead of the 2012 caucuses in exchange for cash payments. Social conservative activist Sam Clovis withdrew his support for Rick Perry last year when he stopped being able to pay. Then he signed with Trump. Stories about this these kinds of deals, which abound, undercut the legitimacy of all endorsements in the minds of savvy voters. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: — The Obama administration will announce as early as today its plan to introduce new visa requirements for European travelers who are dual nationals of Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria, or who have visited any of these countries in the last five years, the Associated Press reports. “U.S. officials and congressional aides involved in discussions say the Homeland Security Department will outline how it will phase in the new rule, designed to make it harder for Europeans who have fought for the Islamic State to enter the United States.” — A fresh WBUR poll shows that Sanders and Kasich would benefit the most from a strong independent turnout in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9. One-third of independents in the state are undecided — and they don’t have to make their minds up about whether to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary until the day of the vote. But they’re poised to have a significant impact: among indies who’ve made up their mind, 29 percent plan to pull the opposite ballot from 2008, the last open presidential contest. Those who benefit the least from indies voting in their primary? Trump, Cruz and Clinton. — Vladimir Putin most likely personally approved the fatal poisoning of a former KGB operative-turned-U.K. intelligence agent at a London hotel, according to a new British report. (Griff Witte) — Militants attacked a police checkpoint in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and killed five policemen. (AP) GET SMART FAST: POWER PLAYERS IN THE NEWS: THE REPUBLICAN RACE– — Trump held a 20-point lead over Cruz in a New Hampshire poll from CNN and WMUR. Jeb and Marco tied for third with 10 percent. A Monmouth national poll put Trump in first with 36%, down from 41% last month. Cruz is second at 17%, up from 14% last month.  Rubio garners 11% support, similar to his 10% showing in December. Everyone else is in single digits. — Bush and Rubio have spent a combined $91 million via their campaigns and outside groups, according to SMG Delta. By comparison, Trump and Cruz have spent just over $8 million on ads. That’s an 11-to-1 ratio. (NBC’s Mark Murray has the full breakdown.) — Stat du jour: $22.5 million has now been spent on commercials attacking Rubio, according to a Rubio ally tracking the air war. The spots, largely from the Bush super PAC, have not taken a toll on his numbers. The breakdown is $8.3 million in Iowa, $7.4 million in New Hampshire and $2.6 million in South Carolina. — Last night in Hollis, N.H., Cruz invoked Dole’s comments that Trump would be a better president than him to make the case that the establishment is for Donald. “Right now the establishment is abandoning Marco Rubio,” said Cruz. “They’re making the assessment that Marco can’t win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Trump. We’re seeing that every day. And Mr. Trump is welcoming the support of the Washington establishment.” (David Weigel) — A group calling itself Americans United for Values is running attack ads in Iowa that call Cruz “a false prophet,” per Politico. — Senior aides to Cruz say they have no plans to go after Trump on television, the New York Times reports. — In Tulsa, Palin managed to connect her son Track’s arrest for domestic violence to Obama’s record on veterans issues. “When my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate to the families who…feel these ramifications of PTSD,” she told the rowdy crowd of around 8,000 people. “And it makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of America’s finest that we have a commander-in-chief who will respect them.” (Jose A. DelReal) — Mark Levin has turned ice cold on Trump. Last night, the conservative radio host said The Donald is “Nixonian,” running an “Alinskyite” campaign and lying about Cruz’s loans from Goldman. “If he becomes the nominee, a lot of people who otherwise would unite under that tent may not, because when you run a campaign of personal attacks, an Alinskyite campaign, wittingly or unwittingly, you turn people off.” (Mediaite has the audio from his show.) — Last night in Keene, N.H., Jeb blasted Rubio and Cruz for being “all over the map” on national security, including Syria. (Watch) SANDERS VS. CLINTON– — Leading voices in the Democratic Party, including Planned Parenthood and the Human Right Campaign, slammed Sanders – for describing them as part of the Democratic establishment. “I was somewhat confused when Senator Sanders said, ‘Well, you know Planned Parenthood and the Human Right’s Campaign, they’re part of the establishment and that’s why they’re supporting Hillary Clinton because it’s all part of the establishment,'” Clinton said in Iowa last night. “I thought, boy I wish it were.” (Abby Phillip) — Dueling ads:  The Clinton campaign launched a 60-second spot in the first two states touting Hillary’s experience, perspective and toughness: Sanders launched his first commercial focused entirely on foreign policy. He makes the case that Clinton has experience but his judgment is solid. He promises he would “defend this nation but … do it responsibly.” He also says that ISIS must be destroyed but that “we should not do it alone.” (He also went up with a spot in Iowa highlighting his opposition to the Bakken oil pipeline, which Clinton has declined to take a position on.) — The Post’s Fact Checker this morning throws cold water on Sanders’ claims that he lost a 1988 House race because he supported an assault weapons ban: “”The evidence is mixed. He could have just as easily lost the election because he split votes with a Democrat, as opposed to being the only candidate without an NRA endorsement. In 1990, even Sanders was less sure that his failure to get an NRA endorsement two years prior was a major factor in his loss (‘It might have been. We don’t know. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t.’) Somewhere between 1990 and 2016, Sanders seems to have decided it’s played a bigger role than he originally thought.” (Michelle Ye Hee Lee) — Sanders ramps up preparations for Super Tuesday: The campaign has deployed about 50 paid campaign aides apiece to Nevada and South Carolina, the two states after New Hampshire. And paid staffers are now on the ground in all of the 11 states that have contests on March 1. “The preparations are part of an effort to buck what has emerged as the latest conventional wisdom surrounding the Democratic contest: that even if Clinton loses the first two contests, her superior campaign infrastructure and other advantages — including the demographics of the electorate — will allow her to overpower Sanders in subsequent states,” John Wagner and Abby Phillip report. — Nevada’s most powerful union, the Culinary Union, will NOT endorse before the caucuses there. The L.A. Times recalls how the group backed Obama in 2008, earning the ire of Bill Clinton and then saw Clinton carry the state any way, showing the limits of their juice. — The Clinton campaign’s Q1 fundraising goal is $50 million. BuzzFeed reports that top officials spent four-and-a-half hours with Latino donors earlier this week, trying to get them to step up. But they want commitments that cash they raise will be spent on outreach to their community. WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: — “Progressive hero or political doofus? Why Bill de Blasio has fallen in the polls,” by Paul Schwartzman in New York: “Two years ago, de Blasio’s victory as an unrepentant progressive in the nation’s most-populous city was evidence of the electorate’s shift to the left … Yet, midway through his term, de Blasio, 54, is buffeted by sagging poll numbers and rebukes from an ever-clamorous spectrum of New Yorkers. Allies on the left complain he’s not progressive enough. Editorial writers deride him as more dreamer than manager. … The mayor’s problem is not his progressive message. It’s the mayor himself, the way he talks, executes his policies and presides over the city.” — “New evidence suggests a ninth planet lurking at the edge of the solar system,” by Joel Achenbach and Rachel Feltman: “Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology announced Wednesday that they have found new evidence of a giant icy planet lurking in the darkness of our solar system far beyond the orbit of Pluto. They are calling it ‘Planet Nine.’ Their paper, published in the Astronomical Journal, estimates the planet’s mass as five to 10 times that of the Earth. But the authors, astronomers Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have not observed the planet directly. … Telescopes on at least two continents are searching for the object, which on average is 20 times farther away than the eighth planet, Neptune. If “Planet Nine” exists, it’s big – about two to four times the diameter of the Earth, which would make it the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. But at such extreme distances, it would reflect so little sunlight that it could evade even the most powerful telescopes.”  SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: –Pictures of the day: Space flowers are the coolest.

Rehnquist’s clerks in the 1996 term, became known at the court for his signature writing style. Nearly two decades later, his colleagues recall how Mr. Cruz, who frequently spoke of how his mentor’s father had been killed by a carjacker, often dwelled on the lurid details of murders that other clerks tended to summarize before quickly moving to the legal merits of the case. … In interviews with nearly two dozen of Mr. Cruz’s former colleagues on the court, many of the clerks working in the chambers of liberal justices, but also several from conservative chambers, depicted Mr. Cruz as ‘obsessed’ with capital punishment. … In Mr. Cruz’s time as a Supreme Court clerk, a coveted step in a legal career that he had meticulously plotted out, he showed his now familiar capacity to infuriate colleagues.” It is, indeed, remarkable how many went on the record to criticize him two decades later.

But he’s for rolling back the war on drugs, ending mass incarceration, and letting former convicts vote.” Koch Industries General Counsel Mark Holden explains that Charles Koch prefers to be described as “a classical liberal” more than a “libertarian.” Holden adds that, “the term ‘libertarian’ can have many different meanings and interpretations, including those who believe in no government, no national defense, and/or extreme individualism above all else and at the expense of others.” — Bloomberg, “What kind of man spends millions to elect Ted Cruz?” by Zachary Mider: “So far, Robert Mercer is the biggest single donor in the race. Working with his daughter Rebekah, he’s spent tens of millions more to advance a conservative agenda, investing in think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation, the media outlet Breitbart.com, and Cambridge Analytica, a data company that builds psychological profiles of voters. Groups he funds have attacked the science of global warming, published a book critical of Hillary Clinton, and bankrolled a documentary celebrating Ayn Rand. … Some allies privately say they think he’s pro-life and opposed to gay marriage, and others say the opposite. Republican operatives gossip about what little scraps of information they can glean—his theatrical Christmas galas [and] his habit of whistling to himself during business meetings.” — The Atlantic, “How Palin created Trump,” by Molly Ball: “Like no one else before Trump, Palin saw a constituency on the right for a politics of resentment that sought as its champion a pure agent of chaos, unfettered by positive or substantive views. … She tapped a vein of previously unheralded biker-bar conservatism that has lain dormant ever since, waiting for Trump to speak to it. Alienated from both parties, Palin proceeded to find a home in the then-nascent organs of the GOP fever swamps … In 2011, a right-wing filmmaker named Stephen Bannon made an adulatory movie about Palin, ‘The Undefeated’; he went on to become executive chairman of Breitbart.com, the website that has served as Trump’s most loyal cheering section. Palin’s people are Trump’s people.” — Americans are skeptical that any of the 2016 candidates would be great as president. The Pew Research Center conducted a national survey this month of 2,009 adults and found that 35% of voters say that Hillary would make either a good or great president, while 28% said she would be terrible; 31% say Trump would be either a good or great president; 11% say he would be great. 52% think Trump would make a poor or terrible president, with 38% saying he would be terrible. 30% say Sanders would be either a good or great president, while 35% say he would be poor or terrible.

1,"Last week, the Iranian government released Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and four other international prisoners.

Now she is suffering from paralysis caused by a neurological disorder and only receiving minimal care. I am overjoyed that Rezaian and three other Iranian American prisoners are now free.

0,"It's finally here: The last GOP debate before the voting actually begins. Eight candidates — well, make that probably seven without Donald Trump — are set to appear on the main debate stage in Des Moines on Thursday to make their closing pitches to Iowa voters, who will be the first in the nation to cast ballots in this election. It's going to be tough to win for anyone not named Trump or Ted Cruz. Polls ahead of Monday's caucuses show the two well ahead of the rest of the field. They are essentially neck and neck with roughly 30 percentage points each, though Trump seems to be taking the lead of late. The next-closest candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), stands at 12 percent, according to a Real Clear Politics average of recent polls. And just as the Republican Party is coming to the realization that a controversial, big-mouthed billionaire could be their nominee, Trump has decided he won't participate in Thursday's debate. Whether he's there or not, the debate will go on. Here are the top seven issues in it: 1. Donald Trump's debate attendance We'll believe it when we see it, but Trump is apparently boycotting the Fox News-hosted debate, claiming that one of the debate's moderators with whom he has feuded, Megyn Kelly, treated him unfairly when they last met on a debate stage in August. “Fox is playing games,” Trump said Tuesday by way of explanation. “They can’t toy with me like they toy with everybody else. Let them have the debate. Let’s see how they do with the ratings.” It's unprecedented for a leading primary candidate to skip such a consequential debate, but Trump's campaign has never been one to follow the rules. (Plus, past debates haven't really given him a boost in the polls.) His decision handed his opponents — especially his top challenger to win the Iowa caucuses — relatively easy avenues of attack. ""Ducking Donald,"" a Cruz letter to supporters called him, challenging Trump to a one-on-one debate. It's unclear what impact Trump's decision, if he holds to it (and that's a real question, given his on-again, off-again relationship with Fox), will have on his standing in the race. Anecdotally, a potential Trump supporter in Iowa told The Washington Post that she thought skipping the debate fit well with Trump's brand. “Everything that he does is so well thought out,"" Tara Wachendorf, 27, said while awaiting a Trump rally Tuesday in Iowa City. ""He’s good at creating controversy, and that’s what’s bringing him more voters. People like that."" 2. The candidates' Christian faith Abortion. Reacting to the Supreme Court's nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. How candidates plan to consult God while in office. In a state in which 57 percent of GOP caucus-goers identified as evangelical or born-again Christians four years ago, expect candidates to go out of their way Thursday to emphasize their Christian roots and beliefs. And indeed, they already have. Cruz's father is a pastor, and Cruz talks regularly on the campaign trail about his Christian faith. As The Post's Sean Sullivan notes, Rubio has recently amped up his campaign-trail conversations about faith, sometimes sounding more like a Sunday school pastor than a presidential candidate. But perhaps the most perplexing relationship between socially conservative Iowa voters and a GOP candidate is Trump's, who somehow just scored the endorsement of Liberty University's head, Jerry Falwell Jr., despite displaying a limited familiarity with the Bible. The Post's Michelle Boorstein and Sarah Pulliam Bailey explain: Call it the Trump God gap: A lot of Americans who are religious and say they want to elect someone who shares their beliefs are this year supporting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, whom they don’t see as very religious at all. 3. The Iran prisoner exchange Depending on your politics, the recent freeing of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and four other Americans imprisoned in Iran is either a validation of the current U.S.-Iranian relationship or a capitulation to a rogue state. President Obama framed the exchange (the United States extended clemency to seven Iranians charged or imprisoned for sanctions violations and dismissed charges for 14 others) as proof that diplomacy works. The prisoners were freed on the same day the U.S. and its allies lifted longtime, crippling sanctions on Iran as part of an international deal struck last summer aimed at blocking Iran from building a nuclear bomb. While almost universally celebrating the freed Americans, Republican GOP candidates said that the deal made the U.S. look weak. Among the other reactions: They criticized the release of the Iranians, said the deal will encourage hostage-taking, and wondered why the release of the prisoners took so long. Republicans are increasingly focused on tough talk when it comes to foreign policy, and GOP candidates also say they want to end the broader Iran nuclear deal once they're in the White House. 4. Terrorism and the Islamic State Given the Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., attacks late last year, terrorism and national security remain high on the 2016 topics list. Polls show that a large majority of Americans are fearful of another terrorist attack and doubtful of Obama's ability to handle it, prompting Obama to go on the offensive to highlight how much the United States is, well, on the offensive in Iraq and Syria to battle the Islamic State. The national focus on terrorism ostensibly works in the Republican Party's favor. GOP candidates traditionally have earned more trust on national security issues from voters than Democrats have. But the most hawkish among the bunch, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), dropped out of the race recently and endorsed former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Graham wanted to put as many as 10,000 troops on the ground. No other candidate has gone that far — especially as Republicans recall the war weariness that marked the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan. So although their tone will be different than Obama's — including on whether to call it ""radical Islam"" — their actual proposals have in many cases not differed in big and clear ways, either from Obama or from one another. 5. The economic recovery In his final State of the Union address, Obama stressed how, under his watch, the United States was pulled back from the brink of a depression and is stronger for it. ""The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world,"" he said, ticking off record-setting private-sector job creation, the national unemployment rate being cut in half and the deficit being trimmed by almost three-quarters. Republican candidates aren't so quick to call that a win, especially when voters express skepticism that the economy is improving. To counter Obama's numbers, GOP candidates often point to the number of people who have decided not to look for work anymore. The labor force participation rate keeps dropping and now stands at 62.6 percent — down from more than 66 percent before the recession. And a nonpartisan National Association of Counties analysis released reports that 93 percent of American counties have yet to fully recover from the recession, with about half recovering on one or fewer of four key indicators. On how they'd reboot the economy, GOP candidates have drawn more contrasts with Obama than with one another. Specifics are sparse, and the claims from governors — such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Bush — of job growth in their states have come under scrutiny by fact checkers. The Washington Post's Fact Checker team urges readers ""to be wary about job-creation claims, either at the state or national level, as so much of what happens in an economy is beyond a politician’s control."" That probably won't stop those claims from being bandied about on Thursday, though. 6. Immigration The perennial topic in the GOP primary race is a particularly troubling one for Rubio, who is leading the GOP ""establishment"" lane as an alternative to Trump and Cruz. In part because of his standing in the polls, multiple Rubio rivals are going after his record in the Senate via increasingly personal attacks. They're zeroing in on Rubio's role in drafting an immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 and included a path to citizenship. Rubio later walked back his support for the bill, even though he still supports some path to legal status. In an election year in which candidates such as Cruz and Trump have surged in part because of their hard-line stances on immigration, Rubio is one of several candidates to shift positions on immigration reform. (Cruz even came under fire from opponents and scrutiny from fact checkers recently for his claim in a December debate that he never supported legalization for undocumented immigrants.) But for all the barbs back and forth, there's little chance of immigration reform policy moving in Congress. In the wake of congressional inaction (the compromise Rubio helped craft failed in the House in 2013), Obama has tried to go it alone by extending deportation relief to undocumented immigrants and some of their parents. His executive actions are held up in courts because of a lawsuit led by Cruz's home state of Texas. But the stage is set for a Supreme Court decision on Obama's executive actions this summer — months before the president leaves office, and months before Americans will decide who replaces him. 7. Supporting the eventual nominee In both polls and voter excitement, Trump is the undisputed front-runner. But does the nontraditional candidate have the campaign infrastructure to get out voters on a cold, potentially snowy night? Will those who have never caucused before and say they like Trump show up for him? Then there's the question of what support Trump would have if he were the nominee. By show of hands in the first GOP debate, the candidates all ostensibly pledged to support whoever would become the party's nominee — all except Trump. (Fox News Channel's Bret Baier asked the candidates to raise their hands if they would not pledge to support the nominee and would not rule out a run as an independent. Trump was the only one with his hand raised, and either he or the question — or maybe both — were booed by the audience.) But in the wake of Trump's suggestion to temporarily ban Muslims from the country, that has become a pledge many candidates appear to wish they could walk back — especially as it looks increasingly possible that Trump could win the Republican nomination. From Bush to Carly Fiorina, candidates have sidestepped questions about whether they'd support Trump if he were the nominee. Unfortunately for them, the scenario they're trying to avoid commenting on looks increasingly likely.","It's finally here: The last GOP debate before the voting actually begins. Eight candidates — well, make that probably seven without Donald Trump — are set to appear on the main debate stage in Des Moines on Thursday to make their closing pitches to Iowa voters, who will be the first in the nation to cast ballots in this election. It's going to be tough to win for anyone not named Trump or Ted Cruz. Polls ahead of Monday's caucuses show the two well ahead of the rest of the field. They are essentially neck and neck with roughly 30 percentage points each, though Trump seems to be taking the lead of late. The next-closest candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), stands at 12 percent, according to a Real Clear Politics average of recent polls. And just as the Republican Party is coming to the realization that a controversial, big-mouthed billionaire could be their nominee, Trump has decided he won't participate in Thursday's debate. Whether he's there or not, the debate will go on. Here are the top seven issues in it: 1. Donald Trump's debate attendance We'll believe it when we see it, but Trump is apparently boycotting the Fox News-hosted debate, claiming that one of the debate's moderators with whom he has feuded, Megyn Kelly, treated him unfairly when they last met on a debate stage in August. “Fox is playing games,” Trump said Tuesday by way of explanation. “They can’t toy with me like they toy with everybody else. Let them have the debate. Let’s see how they do with the ratings.” It's unprecedented for a leading primary candidate to skip such a consequential debate, but Trump's campaign has never been one to follow the rules. (Plus, past debates haven't really given him a boost in the polls.) His decision handed his opponents — especially his top challenger to win the Iowa caucuses — relatively easy avenues of attack. ""Ducking Donald,"" a Cruz letter to supporters called him, challenging Trump to a one-on-one debate. It's unclear what impact Trump's decision, if he holds to it (and that's a real question, given his on-again, off-again relationship with Fox), will have on his standing in the race. Anecdotally, a potential Trump supporter in Iowa told The Washington Post that she thought skipping the debate fit well with Trump's brand. “Everything that he does is so well thought out,"" Tara Wachendorf, 27, said while awaiting a Trump rally Tuesday in Iowa City. ""He’s good at creating controversy, and that’s what’s bringing him more voters. People like that."" 2. The candidates' Christian faith Abortion. Reacting to the Supreme Court's nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. How candidates plan to consult God while in office. In a state in which 57 percent of GOP caucus-goers identified as evangelical or born-again Christians four years ago, expect candidates to go out of their way Thursday to emphasize their Christian roots and beliefs. And indeed, they already have. Cruz's father is a pastor, and Cruz talks regularly on the campaign trail about his Christian faith. As The Post's Sean Sullivan notes, Rubio has recently amped up his campaign-trail conversations about faith, sometimes sounding more like a Sunday school pastor than a presidential candidate. But perhaps the most perplexing relationship between socially conservative Iowa voters and a GOP candidate is Trump's, who somehow just scored the endorsement of Liberty University's head, Jerry Falwell Jr., despite displaying a limited familiarity with the Bible. The Post's Michelle Boorstein and Sarah Pulliam Bailey explain: Call it the Trump God gap: A lot of Americans who are religious and say they want to elect someone who shares their beliefs are this year supporting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, whom they don’t see as very religious at all. 3. The Iran prisoner exchange Depending on your politics, the recent freeing of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and four other Americans imprisoned in Iran is either a validation of the current U.S.-Iranian relationship or a capitulation to a rogue state. President Obama framed the exchange (the United States extended clemency to seven Iranians charged or imprisoned for sanctions violations and dismissed charges for 14 others) as proof that diplomacy works. The prisoners were freed on the same day the U.S. and its allies lifted longtime, crippling sanctions on Iran as part of an international deal struck last summer aimed at blocking Iran from building a nuclear bomb. While almost universally celebrating the freed Americans, Republican GOP candidates said that the deal made the U.S. look weak. Among the other reactions: They criticized the release of the Iranians, said the deal will encourage hostage-taking, and wondered why the release of the prisoners took so long. Republicans are increasingly focused on tough talk when it comes to foreign policy, and GOP candidates also say they want to end the broader Iran nuclear deal once they're in the White House. 4. Terrorism and the Islamic State Given the Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., attacks late last year, terrorism and national security remain high on the 2016 topics list. Polls show that a large majority of Americans are fearful of another terrorist attack and doubtful of Obama's ability to handle it, prompting Obama to go on the offensive to highlight how much the United States is, well, on the offensive in Iraq and Syria to battle the Islamic State. The national focus on terrorism ostensibly works in the Republican Party's favor. GOP candidates traditionally have earned more trust on national security issues from voters than Democrats have. But the most hawkish among the bunch, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), dropped out of the race recently and endorsed former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Graham wanted to put as many as 10,000 troops on the ground. No other candidate has gone that far — especially as Republicans recall the war weariness that marked the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan. So although their tone will be different than Obama's — including on whether to call it ""radical Islam"" — their actual proposals have in many cases not differed in big and clear ways, either from Obama or from one another. 5. The economic recovery In his final State of the Union address, Obama stressed how, under his watch, the United States was pulled back from the brink of a depression and is stronger for it. ""The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world,"" he said, ticking off record-setting private-sector job creation, the national unemployment rate being cut in half and the deficit being trimmed by almost three-quarters. Republican candidates aren't so quick to call that a win, especially when voters express skepticism that the economy is improving. To counter Obama's numbers, GOP candidates often point to the number of people who have decided not to look for work anymore. The labor force participation rate keeps dropping and now stands at 62.6 percent — down from more than 66 percent before the recession. And a nonpartisan National Association of Counties analysis released reports that 93 percent of American counties have yet to fully recover from the recession, with about half recovering on one or fewer of four key indicators. On how they'd reboot the economy, GOP candidates have drawn more contrasts with Obama than with one another. Specifics are sparse, and the claims from governors — such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Bush — of job growth in their states have come under scrutiny by fact checkers. The Washington Post's Fact Checker team urges readers ""to be wary about job-creation claims, either at the state or national level, as so much of what happens in an economy is beyond a politician’s control."" That probably won't stop those claims from being bandied about on Thursday, though. 6.

1,"AS JASON REZAIAN walks the halls of The Post’s gleaming home this week, saluted and celebrated by colleagues and administration officials, I smile at his homecoming after 18 months in an Iranian prison. But today, my thoughts are also with a woman who reportedly still sits in the prison that Jason just exited.

Upon her release, she was outspoken about her mistreatment and, as a result, spent most of last year in prison, sentenced to more than 12 years behind bars.

0,"THE BIG IDEA: -- There is widespread consensus that Donald Trump had a very bad night in Greenville. The question is whether that will cause lasting damage, or if he continues to be coated in Teflon. One of the problems for leaders of the chattering class is that they have been so wrong about Trump so many times for so many months that everyone is gun-shy about predicting his impending decline. The billionaire was flustered and cranky. Not only was he thrown off his game by sustained boos from the crowd and a pile-on by his rivals, but he often sounded more like a Democrat than a Republican. [Get more campaign news delivered directly to your email inbox from The Daily 202] He didn’t just call George W. Bush’s decision to invade Iraq a disaster – which he has done before – but he blamed him for 9/11 and said that the former president “lied” about the presence of weapons of mass destruction as a pretext for war. “Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake,” the frontrunner said at the Peace Center. “George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.” Trump again defended Planned Parenthood, as everyone else promised to defund it. “It does wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion,” he said. “Wonderful things that have to do with women’s health.” Keep in mind that he said this in the buckle of the Bible Belt, just down the road from Furman and Bob Jones universities. -- If next Saturday’s Republican primary becomes solely a referendum on W, which it probably won’t, Jeb could win. The former president, who is flying to Charleston tomorrow night to campaign with his brother, still has an astronomical approval rating among likely voters in the Palmetto State. “I am sick and tired of him going after my family,” Jeb said. “While Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe.” Bush’s popularity in the Palmetto State is why Marco Rubio jumped to the 43rd president’s defense as much as his brother. “I thank God all the time that it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore,” the Florida senator said. “He kept us safe.” It was one of the biggest applause lines of the night, and it prompted Trump to shout: “I lost hundreds of friends. The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush! He kept us safe? That is not safe!” Trump calling Bush a liar might have been a bridge too far, Dave Weigel thinks: “Republicans generally believe, against evidence, that Iraq held weapons of mass destruction when America invaded in 2003. In 2012, a poll conducted by a Dartmouth political scientist found that 63 percent of Republicans still thought this. Last year, a poll from Fairleigh Dickinson University’s Public Mind found a majority of Republicans, 51 percent believed WMD had been found in Iraq.” Scott Clement flags a Post-ABC poll last May that found 54 percent of Republicans still think the Iraq war was worth fighting, while 41 percent said it was not. A January 2007 Post-ABC News poll found 83 percent of Republicans thought Bush had made the country “safer and more secure.” Later that year, our poll found 85 percent of Republicans approved of the way Bush handled the U.S. campaign against terrorism. Romney alum Katie Packer Gage’s group, Our Principles PAC, will launch a digital campaign today to highlight Trump’s support for impeaching W in 2008. Watch her ad here. -- Recall that Trump was basically a non-factor during the previous two debates. He boycotted Fox News before the Iowa caucus, and his rivals basically avoided mentioning him. In New Hampshire last weekend on ABC the rest of the field was focused on arresting Rubio’s momentum. That means it has been quite a while since he took much real heat from his critics, with the exception of a clash with Jeb over eminent domain. But last night, reflecting the establishment’s renewed focus on stopping Trump, the ninth Republican debate was almost entirely about Trump. He got the most airtime (16 minutes), two minutes more than Cruz and five minutes more than Bush, Rubio or Kasich. “Refusing to bow to party orthodoxy or even politeness, Trump trashed one of the most revered families in Republican politics and made a big political bet that standing his ground is better than backing down, no matter how much he is under fire,"" Dan Balz writes in his column. ""Trump did not flinch. But whether he will be punished or rewarded by voters here in next weekend’s primary was the unanswerable question.” Here’s the rub: Two-thirds of likely voters in South Carolina are not supporting Trump. An ARG poll that was in the field during the two days leading up to the debate has Trump at 35 percent, with a closely-bunched battle for second: Kasich at 15, Rubio at 14, Cruz at 12 and Bush at 10. -- So will last night move the numbers? The Fix’s Chris Cillizza: “Trump seemed somewhat out of control and angry for much of the debate. … Trump, who often comes across as tough yet good-natured, came across on Saturday night as downright mean in several exchanges with Bush and Cruz. (And, as any politician will tell you, it's tough to make Cruz into an empathetic figure.) Trump's hard-core supporters will never leave him — no matter how well or badly he does in a debate. And, his hard-core supporters may well be enough to carry him to victory in a week's time in South Carolina. But, that doesn't mean Trump was good Saturday night. He wasn't.” Chris names Rubio and Bush as the two winners. Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, on Fox, called Trump “VERY BITTER”: “He took a risk in being as open and often contemptuous as he was, BUT I don't think it's going to SHAKE his support. The question is, will it LIMIT his support?” BuzzFeed’s McKay Coppins: “The hostile crowd reaction seemed to take a toll on the longtime showman. Trump, his face reddening, erupted at even the faintest prompt or mildest pushback. When a moderator pressed him on a question about Social Security, he grew increasingly defensive and disproportionately upset and by the end of the exchange he was shouting his answer.” The Daily Beast’s Will Rahn: “If the Donald somehow starts to slip -- if his lead in South Carolina narrows, if a clear alternative to his slow march to the nomination develops -- this debate will likely be seen as the turning point, the moment when the man who’s thrown out every rulebook in politics finally learns that a few rules still apply. Or, more likely, no clear alternative rises from tonight’s pileup, as Trump continues his divide-and-conquer undoing of the modern Republican Party.” The Weekly Standard’s John McCormack: “People who follow politics a lot are used to Trump's unhinged moments, but debate audiences haven't seen 2-hour meltdown like this.” “Meet the Press” moderator Chuck Todd: “Trump is testing the limits of whether he can ever grow his support enough to be the conservative party's nominee … unless SC has changed, I think he hurt himself.” Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol: “Best debate yet. Trump definitively exposed. Cruz, Rubio and Bush all impressive in different ways … Jeb most likely won't be the nominee. But he did a service to the country by provoking Trump to blurt out his nutty views on Bush and WMD.” Politico spokesman and longtime Republican operative Brad Dayspring: “Did Trump implode or did he double down on what's propelled him? I'd argue the latter. We'll see.” Politico’s headline says Trump was “BLUDGEONED.” ABC’s Rick Klein: “Predictions of Trump doing damage to his own campaign have been almost comically wrong over the past six months … and perhaps Trump is indeed a better student than everyone in the political class has realized. But on a night where the importance of the race was highlighted anew, Trump’s rivals could portray him as flunking a big test.” Cook Political Report’s Amy Walter: “The key issue post-debate isn’t what it means for Trump, it’s was there a clear ‘establishment’ lane winner? Don’t think there was.” New York Times columnist Ross Douthat: “Even on an ‘off’ night Trump takes up so much oxygen that he makes it very hard for anyone else to look even somewhat presidential … The casual viewer sees a bunch of career politicians being heckled by a famous guy who seems to be telling at least *some* hard truths … As I may have mentioned before, I don't think Trump can be the nominee ... but damn (sorry!) can he make it hard for anyone else to win.” -- Rubio had a good night:  The Weekly Standard’s Stephen Hayes: “After last week's stumbles, Rubio probably needed the debate of his life this week. He got it.” Max Boot: “In tonight's debate it was Trump vs. George W. Bush. Bush won. And best defense of him came from Rubio.” The Resurgent’s Erick Erickson: “Rubio had to prove himself … And he rose to the occasion … [he] found his footing again in the CBS debate and evangelicals leaning toward Rubio have every reason to see how he trends in South Carolina. He was the candidate who turned issues toward family, and I think he got the better of Cruz in the immigration exchange.” The Weekly Standard’s Michael Warren: “He seemed to bounce back with strong, informed answers on national security and taxes. But with his top establishment rivals delivering solid turns themselves, has Rubio’s opportunity to break out of the pack passed?” Chris Cillizza: “Does Rubio still talk a little too fast and sound a little too rehearsed? Yes. But, he clearly helped himself."" -- Many were impressed by Bush: National Review’s Rich Lowry: “Jeb stood up to Trump, just wish he had better rhetorical hammers than saying Trump is insulting his way to the nomination.” … [and] as we learned in NH, it doesn't matter if audience is booing Trump.” Conservative Post blogger Jennifer Rubin: “My God, if this Jeb showed up day one he would have won by now.” Politico’s Eli Stokols: “Jeb really took it to Trump tonight. But as we saw with Christie last week, the aggressor doesn't always benefit. And Trump has been bulletproof.” Washington Examiner’s David Freddoso: “I didn't expect to be saying Jeb is winning a debate, but he's winning a debate … A lot of people who don't even care for Jeb have to be admiring how he bloodied Trump's nose there.” -- The Post’s Fact Checkers examine a dozen specious claims that were made during the debate. Four highlights from Glenn Kessler and Michelle Ye Hee Lee: -- Last night felt more like a three-ring circus or a wrestling match than a debate. That could help John Kasich, who largely stayed above the fray. “I got to tell ya, this is just crazy,"" he said at one point. ""This is just nuts. Geez, oh, man.” Some believed Carson should be voted off the island: -- Justice Antonin Scalia’s death at a Texas hunting resort (of apparently natural causes) set off an immediate political battle about the future of the Supreme Court in an election year. The short-term impact: The Post's Bob Barnes, an expert on the court, forecasts a lot of 4-4 splits on controversial issues like abortion, affirmative action, the rights of religious objectors to the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act, and the president’s powers on immigration and deportation. When there's a tie, the decision by the lower court is affirmed. That means there is no precedent for the future. This means that who won in the lower court matters a great deal.  The coming fight: President Obama says he will nominate a successor, but even before he could announce that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate will not confirm anyone this year. “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,” the Kentucky senator said. Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) retorted:  “Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate’s most essential Constitutional responsibilities.” In other Scalia-related developments: -- Trump, Cruz, Rubio and John Kasich all suggested either Obama shouldn't pick a replacement, or that the Senate should ""delay, delay, delay"" in Trump's words. -- Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders agreed that it is ""outrageous"" for Republicans to block a nomination. ""Apparently they believe that the Constitution does not allow a Democratic president to bring forth a nominee to replace Justice Scalia,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""I strongly disagree with that.” -- Who will Obama nominate? One leading candidate will probably be Sri Srinivasan, an ex-Justice Department official who is now on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. He'd be the first judge of South Asian descent on SCOTUS and was confirmed, 97-0, for his current post by the Senate in May 2013. Read Jeffrey Toobin's New Yorker story on Srinivasan here. Other names mentioned by court insiders last night, per USA Today: Srinivasan's colleagues on the D.C. Circuit Patricia Millett and Merrick Garland, as well as California Supreme Court Justice Goodwin Liu. -- Scalia passed away at a luxury West Texas ranch close to the Mexican border called Cibolo Creek, which has hosted movie stars like Mick Jagger, Bruce Willis and Tommy Lee Jones. (Elise Viebeck) -- Read Barnes' full obituary of Scalia, who died at 79, here. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Saturday Night Live opened with a funny Hillary skit. It features five of the cast members sitting around a table over brunch talking about how they know they're supposed to vote for Clinton, but that they are going to support Bernie Sanders.

Hillary replied: ""What can be done?"" -- Breanne Deppisch and Elise Viebeck contributed to this special Sunday edition of The Daily 202. GET SMART FAST:​​ POWER PLAYERS IN THE NEWS: WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: -- “Mysterious and fast-moving, Zika virus has world’s health leaders scrambling,” by Lena H. Sun and Brady Dennis: “Global health authorities and government officials are mobilizing to battle the fast-spreading Zika virus … But their efforts are being hobbled by a fundamental lack of understanding of a disease that has spread to nearly three dozen countries and is moving so quickly that some experts estimate it could infect as many as 3 million to 4 million people within 12 months. Unlike Ebola, which had been studied extensively by the time it emerged in Guinea in late 2013, Zika wasn’t considered a menace. The mystery surrounding the virus — officials aren’t sure what will turn up next — makes it ‘much more insidious, cunning and evil’ than Ebola, said Bruce Aylward, a WHO official. ‘This emergency is because of what’s unknown,’ said David Heymann, an infectious-disease professor. But it is not always clear what that decisive action should be, or how to marshal the political and financial resources needed to make it happen.” -- “17 years after Columbine, the mother of one of the killers finally tells her story,” by Carlos Lozada: “Stories of victims are prevalent in our reckoning with mass shootings. They carry greater moral force, or less moral ambiguity, than those of perpetrators. But Sue Klebold is both the mother of a killer and of one of his victims, too … This book’s insights are painful and necessary, and its contradictions inevitable. It is an apology to the loved ones of the victims; a catalogue of warning signs missed. Sue knows she will always be seen as ‘the woman who raised a murderer,’ but she insists that she and Tom were loving, engaged parents. Though they recognized that Dylan had problems, ‘we simply — and drastically and lethally— underestimated the depth and severity of his pain and everything he was capable of doing to make it stop.’” Related: The CDC reports a spike in Zika infections in PUERTO RICO over the past month. The mosquito that commonly transmits the virus is prevalent there.

VIDEOS OF THE DAY: Here's a 3-minute recap of the debate: And the moment where Cruz pulled out his Spanish skills, after Rubio accused him of not being able to speak the language: The weirdest moment of the debate was when Trump brought up a quote Jeb gave the Boston Globe about taking off his pants: Watch Scalia reflect on his 1986 confirmation hearing: Here are President Obama's comments on Scalia's death: And Bill Clinton's reaction to the news: As part of the outreach to African Americans, Sanders' campaign released a five-minute video of him endorsing Jesse Jackson in 1988, using some of the same rhetoric he still does today: This was one heck of a dunk from the NBA's Slam Dunk Contest:","THE BIG IDEA: -- There is widespread consensus that Donald Trump had a very bad night in Greenville. The question is whether that will cause lasting damage, or if he continues to be coated in Teflon. One of the problems for leaders of the chattering class is that they have been so wrong about Trump so many times for so many months that everyone is gun-shy about predicting his impending decline. The billionaire was flustered and cranky. Not only was he thrown off his game by sustained boos from the crowd and a pile-on by his rivals, but he often sounded more like a Democrat than a Republican. [Get more campaign news delivered directly to your email inbox from The Daily 202] He didn’t just call George W. Bush’s decision to invade Iraq a disaster – which he has done before – but he blamed him for 9/11 and said that the former president “lied” about the presence of weapons of mass destruction as a pretext for war. “Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake,” the frontrunner said at the Peace Center. “George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.” Trump again defended Planned Parenthood, as everyone else promised to defund it. “It does wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion,” he said. “Wonderful things that have to do with women’s health.” Keep in mind that he said this in the buckle of the Bible Belt, just down the road from Furman and Bob Jones universities. -- If next Saturday’s Republican primary becomes solely a referendum on W, which it probably won’t, Jeb could win. The former president, who is flying to Charleston tomorrow night to campaign with his brother, still has an astronomical approval rating among likely voters in the Palmetto State. “I am sick and tired of him going after my family,” Jeb said. “While Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe.” Bush’s popularity in the Palmetto State is why Marco Rubio jumped to the 43rd president’s defense as much as his brother. “I thank God all the time that it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore,” the Florida senator said. “He kept us safe.” It was one of the biggest applause lines of the night, and it prompted Trump to shout: “I lost hundreds of friends. The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush! He kept us safe? That is not safe!” Trump calling Bush a liar might have been a bridge too far, Dave Weigel thinks: “Republicans generally believe, against evidence, that Iraq held weapons of mass destruction when America invaded in 2003. In 2012, a poll conducted by a Dartmouth political scientist found that 63 percent of Republicans still thought this. Last year, a poll from Fairleigh Dickinson University’s Public Mind found a majority of Republicans, 51 percent believed WMD had been found in Iraq.” Scott Clement flags a Post-ABC poll last May that found 54 percent of Republicans still think the Iraq war was worth fighting, while 41 percent said it was not. A January 2007 Post-ABC News poll found 83 percent of Republicans thought Bush had made the country “safer and more secure.” Later that year, our poll found 85 percent of Republicans approved of the way Bush handled the U.S. campaign against terrorism. Romney alum Katie Packer Gage’s group, Our Principles PAC, will launch a digital campaign today to highlight Trump’s support for impeaching W in 2008. Watch her ad here. -- Recall that Trump was basically a non-factor during the previous two debates. He boycotted Fox News before the Iowa caucus, and his rivals basically avoided mentioning him. In New Hampshire last weekend on ABC the rest of the field was focused on arresting Rubio’s momentum. That means it has been quite a while since he took much real heat from his critics, with the exception of a clash with Jeb over eminent domain. But last night, reflecting the establishment’s renewed focus on stopping Trump, the ninth Republican debate was almost entirely about Trump. He got the most airtime (16 minutes), two minutes more than Cruz and five minutes more than Bush, Rubio or Kasich. “Refusing to bow to party orthodoxy or even politeness, Trump trashed one of the most revered families in Republican politics and made a big political bet that standing his ground is better than backing down, no matter how much he is under fire,"" Dan Balz writes in his column. ""Trump did not flinch. But whether he will be punished or rewarded by voters here in next weekend’s primary was the unanswerable question.” Here’s the rub: Two-thirds of likely voters in South Carolina are not supporting Trump. An ARG poll that was in the field during the two days leading up to the debate has Trump at 35 percent, with a closely-bunched battle for second: Kasich at 15, Rubio at 14, Cruz at 12 and Bush at 10. -- So will last night move the numbers? The Fix’s Chris Cillizza: “Trump seemed somewhat out of control and angry for much of the debate. … Trump, who often comes across as tough yet good-natured, came across on Saturday night as downright mean in several exchanges with Bush and Cruz. (And, as any politician will tell you, it's tough to make Cruz into an empathetic figure.) Trump's hard-core supporters will never leave him — no matter how well or badly he does in a debate. And, his hard-core supporters may well be enough to carry him to victory in a week's time in South Carolina. But, that doesn't mean Trump was good Saturday night. He wasn't.” Chris names Rubio and Bush as the two winners. Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, on Fox, called Trump “VERY BITTER”: “He took a risk in being as open and often contemptuous as he was, BUT I don't think it's going to SHAKE his support. The question is, will it LIMIT his support?” BuzzFeed’s McKay Coppins: “The hostile crowd reaction seemed to take a toll on the longtime showman. Trump, his face reddening, erupted at even the faintest prompt or mildest pushback. When a moderator pressed him on a question about Social Security, he grew increasingly defensive and disproportionately upset and by the end of the exchange he was shouting his answer.” The Daily Beast’s Will Rahn: “If the Donald somehow starts to slip -- if his lead in South Carolina narrows, if a clear alternative to his slow march to the nomination develops -- this debate will likely be seen as the turning point, the moment when the man who’s thrown out every rulebook in politics finally learns that a few rules still apply. Or, more likely, no clear alternative rises from tonight’s pileup, as Trump continues his divide-and-conquer undoing of the modern Republican Party.” The Weekly Standard’s John McCormack: “People who follow politics a lot are used to Trump's unhinged moments, but debate audiences haven't seen 2-hour meltdown like this.” “Meet the Press” moderator Chuck Todd: “Trump is testing the limits of whether he can ever grow his support enough to be the conservative party's nominee … unless SC has changed, I think he hurt himself.” Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol: “Best debate yet. Trump definitively exposed. Cruz, Rubio and Bush all impressive in different ways … Jeb most likely won't be the nominee. But he did a service to the country by provoking Trump to blurt out his nutty views on Bush and WMD.” Politico spokesman and longtime Republican operative Brad Dayspring: “Did Trump implode or did he double down on what's propelled him? I'd argue the latter. We'll see.” Politico’s headline says Trump was “BLUDGEONED.” ABC’s Rick Klein: “Predictions of Trump doing damage to his own campaign have been almost comically wrong over the past six months … and perhaps Trump is indeed a better student than everyone in the political class has realized. But on a night where the importance of the race was highlighted anew, Trump’s rivals could portray him as flunking a big test.” Cook Political Report’s Amy Walter: “The key issue post-debate isn’t what it means for Trump, it’s was there a clear ‘establishment’ lane winner? Don’t think there was.” New York Times columnist Ross Douthat: “Even on an ‘off’ night Trump takes up so much oxygen that he makes it very hard for anyone else to look even somewhat presidential … The casual viewer sees a bunch of career politicians being heckled by a famous guy who seems to be telling at least *some* hard truths … As I may have mentioned before, I don't think Trump can be the nominee ... but damn (sorry!) can he make it hard for anyone else to win.” -- Rubio had a good night:  The Weekly Standard’s Stephen Hayes: “After last week's stumbles, Rubio probably needed the debate of his life this week. He got it.” Max Boot: “In tonight's debate it was Trump vs. George W. Bush. Bush won. And best defense of him came from Rubio.” The Resurgent’s Erick Erickson: “Rubio had to prove himself … And he rose to the occasion … [he] found his footing again in the CBS debate and evangelicals leaning toward Rubio have every reason to see how he trends in South Carolina. He was the candidate who turned issues toward family, and I think he got the better of Cruz in the immigration exchange.” The Weekly Standard’s Michael Warren: “He seemed to bounce back with strong, informed answers on national security and taxes. But with his top establishment rivals delivering solid turns themselves, has Rubio’s opportunity to break out of the pack passed?” Chris Cillizza: “Does Rubio still talk a little too fast and sound a little too rehearsed? Yes. But, he clearly helped himself."" -- Many were impressed by Bush: National Review’s Rich Lowry: “Jeb stood up to Trump, just wish he had better rhetorical hammers than saying Trump is insulting his way to the nomination.” … [and] as we learned in NH, it doesn't matter if audience is booing Trump.” Conservative Post blogger Jennifer Rubin: “My God, if this Jeb showed up day one he would have won by now.” Politico’s Eli Stokols: “Jeb really took it to Trump tonight. But as we saw with Christie last week, the aggressor doesn't always benefit. And Trump has been bulletproof.” Washington Examiner’s David Freddoso: “I didn't expect to be saying Jeb is winning a debate, but he's winning a debate … A lot of people who don't even care for Jeb have to be admiring how he bloodied Trump's nose there.” -- The Post’s Fact Checkers examine a dozen specious claims that were made during the debate. Four highlights from Glenn Kessler and Michelle Ye Hee Lee: -- Last night felt more like a three-ring circus or a wrestling match than a debate. That could help John Kasich, who largely stayed above the fray. “I got to tell ya, this is just crazy,"" he said at one point. ""This is just nuts. Geez, oh, man.” Some believed Carson should be voted off the island: -- Justice Antonin Scalia’s death at a Texas hunting resort (of apparently natural causes) set off an immediate political battle about the future of the Supreme Court in an election year. The short-term impact: The Post's Bob Barnes, an expert on the court, forecasts a lot of 4-4 splits on controversial issues like abortion, affirmative action, the rights of religious objectors to the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act, and the president’s powers on immigration and deportation. When there's a tie, the decision by the lower court is affirmed. That means there is no precedent for the future. This means that who won in the lower court matters a great deal.  The coming fight: President Obama says he will nominate a successor, but even before he could announce that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate will not confirm anyone this year. “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,” the Kentucky senator said. Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) retorted:  “Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate’s most essential Constitutional responsibilities.” In other Scalia-related developments: -- Trump, Cruz, Rubio and John Kasich all suggested either Obama shouldn't pick a replacement, or that the Senate should ""delay, delay, delay"" in Trump's words. -- Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders agreed that it is ""outrageous"" for Republicans to block a nomination. ""Apparently they believe that the Constitution does not allow a Democratic president to bring forth a nominee to replace Justice Scalia,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""I strongly disagree with that.” -- Who will Obama nominate? One leading candidate will probably be Sri Srinivasan, an ex-Justice Department official who is now on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. He'd be the first judge of South Asian descent on SCOTUS and was confirmed, 97-0, for his current post by the Senate in May 2013. Read Jeffrey Toobin's New Yorker story on Srinivasan here. Other names mentioned by court insiders last night, per USA Today: Srinivasan's colleagues on the D.C. Circuit Patricia Millett and Merrick Garland, as well as California Supreme Court Justice Goodwin Liu. -- Scalia passed away at a luxury West Texas ranch close to the Mexican border called Cibolo Creek, which has hosted movie stars like Mick Jagger, Bruce Willis and Tommy Lee Jones. (Elise Viebeck) -- Read Barnes' full obituary of Scalia, who died at 79, here. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Saturday Night Live opened with a funny Hillary skit. It features five of the cast members sitting around a table over brunch talking about how they know they're supposed to vote for Clinton, but that they are going to support Bernie Sanders.

And you can see ""Weekend Update"" here. -- The State Department released 550 more emails from Hillary's private email server, totaling 1,000 pages. Of them, 84 were retroactively classified, per CNN. A judge said all of the relevant Clinton emails as secretary of state from her homebrew email server must be released by Feb. 29, one day before the Super Tuesday primaries. Among the new emails are a bunch from Sidney Blumenthal, including ""memos and thoughts on Libya"" and the David Petraeus scandal. In one funny email highlighted by NPR, top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills forwarded a Post story titled ""Bill Clinton's ego could cost Obama in November."" Hillary replied: ""What can be done?"" -- Breanne Deppisch and Elise Viebeck contributed to this special Sunday edition of The Daily 202. GET SMART FAST:​​ POWER PLAYERS IN THE NEWS: WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: -- “Mysterious and fast-moving, Zika virus has world’s health leaders scrambling,” by Lena H. Sun and Brady Dennis: “Global health authorities and government officials are mobilizing to battle the fast-spreading Zika virus … But their efforts are being hobbled by a fundamental lack of understanding of a disease that has spread to nearly three dozen countries and is moving so quickly that some experts estimate it could infect as many as 3 million to 4 million people within 12 months. Unlike Ebola, which had been studied extensively by the time it emerged in Guinea in late 2013, Zika wasn’t considered a menace. The mystery surrounding the virus — officials aren’t sure what will turn up next — makes it ‘much more insidious, cunning and evil’ than Ebola, said Bruce Aylward, a WHO official. ‘This emergency is because of what’s unknown,’ said David Heymann, an infectious-disease professor. But it is not always clear what that decisive action should be, or how to marshal the political and financial resources needed to make it happen.” -- “17 years after Columbine, the mother of one of the killers finally tells her story,” by Carlos Lozada: “Stories of victims are prevalent in our reckoning with mass shootings. They carry greater moral force, or less moral ambiguity, than those of perpetrators. But Sue Klebold is both the mother of a killer and of one of his victims, too … This book’s insights are painful and necessary, and its contradictions inevitable. It is an apology to the loved ones of the victims; a catalogue of warning signs missed. Sue knows she will always be seen as ‘the woman who raised a murderer,’ but she insists that she and Tom were loving, engaged parents. Though they recognized that Dylan had problems, ‘we simply — and drastically and lethally— underestimated the depth and severity of his pain and everything he was capable of doing to make it stop.’” Related: The CDC reports a spike in Zika infections in PUERTO RICO over the past month.

0,"CAIRO — Four American journalists left Bahrain this week after they were arrested by authorities who accused them of ""participating with a group of saboteurs who were carrying out riot acts."" Their arrests made headlines – and drew swift attention from the U.S. government. Abduljalil Alsingace is in jail, sentenced to life. Most people have never heard of the Bahraini journalist and blogger. He has no backer to apply pressure for his release – or even to receive humane treatment in prison. His plight attracts virtually no international attention. The United States has its 5th Fleet based on the small island nation. All it took was a few phone calls to get the four Americans released. ""We are grateful to the Bahraini authorities for their speedy resolution of the issue and to the U.S. Embassy in Bahrain and State Department officials who worked tirelessly to assist the group,"" the families of the released journalists said in their statement. Alsingace and other Bahraini journalists are languishing in jails more or less for the same reason the Americans were arrested: covering the fallout from the Arab Spring uprisings five years ago. The 2011 revolts in Bahrain were put down by force with the assistance of other Gulf nations.

And according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there are at least seven Bahraini journalists behind bars. Many more are facing trials, according to local Bahraini organizations. The Bahrain Center for Human Rights has also recently published a report stating that in the last four months of 2015,  more than 400 people were arrested and there has been ""a pattern of enforced disappearance, due process violations, and severe torture within the Bahraini criminal justice system, finding evidence of the use of systematic torture between 2011 and 2015.""

0,"THE BIG IDEA: The GOP field could winnow tonight from four candidates to three or two. It is not out of the question that Donald Trump could sweep all five states that vote on this second Super Tuesday: Florida, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Illinois. But a split decision of some kind seems more likely. John Kasich is closing strong and considered the favorite to prevail in his home state. It is a win-or-drop-out situation for Kasich and Marco Rubio. But the stakes are also high for Ted Cruz, who needs to prove that he would be a worthy street fighter in a head-to-head match-up with Trump. “Cruz, who has been boxed out of some news cycles by the media's focus on Trump, is looking to set low expectations, then blow past them,” Dave Weigel reports from Columbus. “He is looking to strong performances in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, the lightly polled megastates lost in recent coverage, to cut any delegate lead Trump might build Tuesday. The first two states border the parts of Iowa that gave Cruz his first victory.” There are 367 Republican delegates at stake. By this time tomorrow, more than half of the total delegates to the convention in Cleveland will have been awarded. -- The question for Democrats: How much of an aberration was Michigan? One of Hillary Clinton’s problems last Tuesday was the complacency of her supporters. This week, polls in every state but Illinois and Missouri again show her with pretty sizable leads. And the action is mostly on the Republican side. The risk again is that her people stay home or take GOP ballots.  Even if Sanders does well, how many delegates does he get? “Multiple polls (show) Sanders closing in on Clinton in three states in the industrial Midwest — Missouri, Illinois and Ohio. But polls also show Clinton far ahead in Florida and in North Carolina, setting up the possibility of an outcome parallel to last week’s contests, when Sanders scored a narrow and surprising victory in Michigan, yet Clinton came away with a widened lead in the delegate count because of her resounding victory in Mississippi,” John Wagner and Jose A. DelReal report. “In other words, Clinton appears poised to continue her progress toward the Democratic nomination, but ever more bloodied by her battles with Sanders.” -- FLORIDA is today’s biggest prize for Republicans, offering 99 delegates in a winner-take-all primary. Though a surprise should not be ruled out, Trump must be recognized as the heavy favorite. He’s led every single poll there this year. A big Trump win here would be a big loss for the anti-Trump efforts, throwing into question the effectiveness of their attacks. Anti-Trump forces have now spent $15.7 million going after him in the Sunshine State, Anu Narayanswamy tabulates from FEC filings.  Will Rubio drop out tonight? Unlike Kasich, the senator has not publicly said he will quit if he loses his home state. His super PAC, which has spent about $10 million in Florida, has not put any money behind ads in the forthcoming primaries, not exactly a show of confidence… (CNN) The Post’s Ed O’Keefe, who is following Rubio now after spending a year chasing Jeb full time, relays from Miami that Rubio is “exhausted” and “a funeral mood” has set in at his events, similar to what cloaked the Bush campaign in its waning days. One data point on why you shouldn’t count out Rubio: Rubio allies are pointing to heavy early voting in Miami-Dade to argue that their turnout operation is better than Trump’s. Nearly 2 million early and absentee ballots have been cast in Florida, including more than 1.1 million Republicans. Those totals include more than 100,000 Republican ballots cast in Rubio’s home county, the Wall Street Journal notes. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who wants to run for governor in 2018 (and could thus potentially face Rubio in a GOP primary), endorsed Trump. She previously backed Jeb Bush, who has stayed conspicuously neutral ahead of today’s primary. (The former governor still blames Rubio for ruining his presidential hopes, and he likely does not believe that weighing in could save his one-time protégé.) Will Trump make inroads with unlikely demographics? The Miami Herald reports that he is faring surprisingly well with Hispanic Republicans: “Cuban Americans in South Florida have the rare opportunity to vote for two of their own for the U.S. presidency. Yet some are making a different choice: They’re backing Trump … There is anecdotal evidence of support among Miami-Dade’s staunchly Republican Cuban-American voters even as most back Rubio — the son of Cuban immigrants — whom many Cuban-American voters helped elect to the U.S. Senate in 2010.” The paper says Cubans don’t care as much about deportation and the border wall. “I don’t think Cuban. I think American. … The worst problem the U.S. has is the economy,” said former Hialeah Mayor Julio Martinez, who convinced his wife who once lived in the U.S. illegally to vote for Trump. -- Does the recent violence scare away any Trump voters?  Early evidence suggests not: A Monmouth University poll published yesterday found that two-thirds of likely Florida GOP primary voters say the events in Chicago have no effect on their view of Trump. The same survey showed Trump leading Rubio by 17 points (44-27), compared to an 8 point lead last week (38-30). Trump’s rivals continued to seize on the drama at his events as they fanned out across the battlegrounds.  Rubio framed the election as “a choice between optimism and fear.” “I don’t think there’s anyone in the history of American politics that compares to the vulgarity of a Donald Trump candidacy,” he told reporters. “In the history of American politics!” (Sean Sullivan) Cruz responded gamely when he was heckled in Peoria, Illinois. ""See sir, one difference between this and a Donald Trump rally is I’m not asking anyone to punch you in the face,"" he said. Trump said there’s a double standard and even denied that there’s been tension. “It’s a love fest. These are love fests,” Trump said at one of his events. Sarah Palin, campaigning for Trump in Florida, decried “petty, punk-ass little thuggery.” She accused the protesters of endangering the First Amendment rights of Trump’s supporters and accused the mainstream media of “being on the thugs’ side.” Meanwhile, a North Carolina sheriff’s office said it will not charge Trump with “inciting a riot” after his raucous rally there last week (where a supporter punched an African American protestor), saying the events do not meet the lawful requirements to support a conviction. (David A. Fahrenthold and Sarah Larimer) OHIO—Kasich’s last stand?  The Buckeye State has 66 delegates at stake in its winner-take-all primary. A final Monmouth poll shows Kasich up 40-35 over Trump, with Cruz at 15 and Rubio at 5. How the final day is playing in the Cleveland Plain Dealer: “Kasich, the state's popular two-term governor, takes the stage at a high school about a mile from his home. There's Mitt Romney by his side … who, when he was the Republican nominee in 2012, received little help or enthusiasm from Kasich. But the former Massachusetts governor didn't join the campaign trail with Kasich out of personal loyalty or because Kasich was his favorite candidate. Romney was trying to save the soul of his party by dragging Kasich across the finish line ... At this moment, he is the GOP establishment's last best hope. And yet it's not the most confident pose for Kasich. He is fighting – harder than he ever thought he would have to – to win Ohio.” Across town, Trump spoke to a few hundred at an aircraft hangar in Youngstown: “The rally was announced less than 24 hours earlier, after the Trump campaign changed its schedule to focus on Ohio.” Does Romney have any juice? Mitt stopped short formally of endorsing Kasich when they campaigned together yesterday at an airplane museum in North Canton. “You’re the ones who are going to decide if he becomes the next president of the United States,” Romney said. “You look at this guy, and unlike the other people running, he has a real track record. He has the kind of record that you want in Washington. That’s why I’m convinced that you’re going to do the right thing tomorrow.” The Columbus Dispatch reports on a surge in Ohio voters who are switching party affiliations: “Through Friday, Franklin County had about 39,000 requests for absentee ballots, and roughly 17,000 came from voters changing their registration. Most of the tide represents unaffiliated voters requesting a partisan ballot. About 5,700 of those so-called independents wanted to vote in the Republican primary while almost 10,000 asked for a Democratic ballot.” -- How potent is the trade issue for Sanders and Trump? It was a big factor in their wins in Michigan last week. The Rust Belt has been hit hard by outsourcing and the decline of manufacturing. Both populists emphasized their opponents’ support for “bad trade deals” yesterday while campaigning in Ohio. ""He signed NAFTA -- NAFTA destroyed Ohio,"" Trump said of Kasich in Youngstown. ""It destroyed Ohio! And now he wants to sign TPP! That is going to be worse. I have studied it so carefully. It's going to be worse for Ohio. It’s going to take all of your car business out. Your car business is going to be destroyed by TPP. He wants it, and nobody knows why he wants it, including himself. Maybe one of his lobbyists is demanding it. Maybe one of the other countries that's going to benefit is demanding it. Who knows? It is completely crazy."" ""Kasich cannot make America great again,"" Trump added. “If you didn't hit oil -- and he didn't have anything to do with that -- this (state) would have been as bad as any of 'em. Oil has gone way down, and yet our budget’s gone up 35 percent, more than any other state in the United States. That means you're gonna have a big, big problem."" “You in Ohio and in the Midwest know about the disastrous trade policies,” Sanders said in Akron, where a once-thriving tire industry has experienced a major decline. “It took me about 13 seconds to figure out that NAFTA was written by corporate America, that its goal was to shut down factories and plants in America, to move abroad to find cheap labor, and bring those products back into America. It didn’t take a PhD to figure that out.” -- ILLINOIS is shaping up to be the marquee contest for Democrats today. It’s a Midwestern state (good for Sanders) and racially diverse (great for Clinton). FiveThirtyEight, which gave Hillary a 99 percent chance of winning Michigan, complains that the polls are skewed, which makes it harder to forecast: A recent Chicago Tribune poll gave Clinton a 42 point lead, while last week’s YouGov poll put Sanders at a 2 point advantage. Watch Chicago. Sanders returned to the Windy City for a late-night election-eve rally – stumping there just a few hours after Clinton and trying to score another in her home state. Did Sanders make the primary a referendum on Rahm Emanuel? The mayor and former White House chief of staff is toxically unpopular, and he’s been on the sidelines. The Vermont senator has aggressively tried to link him with Clinton, Politico reports. The Chicago Sun-Times looks at the last-minute efforts to stop Bernie from catching up: “Bill Clinton hit two black churches— in west suburban Maywood and South Shore — to spur crucial African-American voter turnout. The Clinton campaign sent a team of high-profile surrogates to fan out across the Chicago area after two new polls pointed to the potential of a Sanders’ win in Illinois, turf long seen as solidly for Clinton.” -- NORTH CAROLINA is looking very good for Clinton. If she wins in Florida and North Carolina, Hillary will have won every Southern state. The Charlotte Observer notes that three presidential candidates descended on the city Monday: Sanders rallied supporters at PNC Music Pavilion near UNC Charlotte, while Clinton made a late-night appearance at Grady Cole Center just outside uptown. Though the latest polls put Clinton way ahead of Sanders (56-37), the Vermont Senator hopes to pull another Michigan-style upset by pressing his differences with Clinton over trade. She has racked up endorsements in the Tar Heel State: Clinton has the backing of 44 of the General Assembly’s 61 Democratic lawmakers, including all the Democratic women. And she’s counting on heavy support from African-Americans, who are likely to make up at least a third of the Democratic primary electorate. A record (for a primary) of 56,752 people cast early or absentee ballots in Mecklenburg County, the Observer reports: “Turnout could rival the county’s recent high of 34 percent, set in 2008.” -- Sanders campaigned yesterday in four of the five states that vote today. Florida is the only one he skipped, and it’s because the primary is closed, which means independents won’t be able to vote for him, and there are too many retirees for him to be viable. Clinton has consistently won seniors. -- MISSOURI might be today’s biggest wildcard. It’s hard to know exactly what’s going on in the Show Me State, which offers 71 Democratic delegates and 52 Republican delegates. The state’s lack of polling – coupled with its hard-to-predict open primary system – has kept pundits from making accurate predictions. From the story in this morning’s Post-Dispatch: “The St. Louis area saw Monday appearances by both former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, addressing supporters at a Clayton restaurant; and Sanders, who had a large crowd in St. Charles, his third big rally in the region in the past two weeks. A Post-Dispatch poll last week indicated that Missouri voters in both parties slightly favor the front-runners — Clinton and Trump. But their leads over Sanders and Cruz, respectively, were within the poll’s margins for error, making the races potential nail-biters.” -- Missouri is Cruz’s best shot at a win today. Cruz has done extremely well in the Midwest (think Iowa and Kansas), and he has netted key endorsements from political figures in the state. Rubio’s descent means Cruz will get an even clearer shot at Trump in the state. BUT Missouri’s open primary could make it easier for Trump to win. Independent voters break almost overwhelmingly in support of the populist candidates, and a strong independent turnout would likely boost his campaign to success. Can Cruz consolidate the Stop Trump movement? Trying to be conciliatory, he said yesterday that Kasich and Rubio could both have spots in his cabinet. From Katie Zezima in North Carolina: “As Cruz hopes to narrow the primary to a two-man race, he is increasingly trying to appeal to very different groups: working-class voters who may be drawn to Trump, and political establishment voters who want to stop him. The fit is not a natural one for Cruz, who pillories the establishment … But with Rubio’s candidacy sputtering and Kasich far behind, the establishment is warming to him … ‘It comes down to the reality of a Trump nomination,’ said a [Bush-turned-Cruz] supporter. ‘Trump would be a disaster and an embarrassment for the nation. Ted is the best chance to defeat Trump.’” Funny color: Cruz is bragging on the trail about finishing “dead last” in Saturday’s D.C convention. Fewer than 3,000 voted; Rubio got 10 delegates to nine for Kasich. ""The Washington lobbyists looked at this field and said goodness gracious, give us anybody but Cruz,” he says. It always gets cheers.

 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Hillary was picked up on a hot mic speculating about why Christie endorsed Trump. From Abby Phillip: During a commercial break while taping an MSNBC town hall, Clinton asked host Chris Matthews: ""Why did he support him? ... Did he have a debt?"" Matthews explained that Christie and others who support Trump ""want a future"" politically. He added that Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) ""isn't going anywhere,"" which leaves Christie ""nowhere"" to go. ""I don’t think he would win right now,"" Clinton chimed in. Then they chatted and chuckled about how Clinton's young staff does not get some of her cultural references. Listen to a three-minute audio recording from the chit-chat between Matthews and HRC: -- During the town hall itself, Clinton said Trump is evoking the kind of mob violence “that led to lynching."" The full quote: “When you are inciting mob violence, which is what Trump is doing in those clips, there’s a lot of memories that people have. People remember mob violence that led to lynching. People remember mob violence that led to people being shot, being grabbed, being mistreated.” -- Reporters who are following Clinton believe that she is fatigued, and they're portraying three gaffes over three days as evidence that the unexpectedly competitive contest has taken a physical toll on the 68-year old. From The Post's main day story, anchored by John Wagner and Jose A. DelReal: ""Friday morning, the day of Nancy Reagan’s funeral, Clinton mistakenly praised the former first lady for 'starting a conversation' about HIV/AIDS.

Police say Colson was likely killed by friendly fire. And the gunman, 22-year-old Michael Ford, intended to die in the shooting. “Ford recorded his last will and testament in a cellphone video before heading to the Landover police station,” report Lynh Bui, Peter Hermann and Justin Jouvenal. “Ford fired randomly at an ambulance and the doors of the station, pinning down officers who poured from the station to confront him.” His two brothers stood nearby, recording the ambush on their cellphones. Amid that barrage, Colson arrived to visit another officer. The off-duty detective ""sprang from an unmarked police car and ‘heroically’ drew Ford’s fire as he exchanged shots with the gunman. The move allowed officers to overcome Ford, but in a chaotic moment, a shot probably fired by one of Colson’s fellow officers struck him and ultimately took his life. Colson was an undercover narcotics detective and was wearing street clothes. It is unclear whether the officer who shot Colson confused him with an assailant or whether Colson was wounded accidentally amid the chaotic gunfire.” Deep-dive feature on a die-hard Trump supporter --> “Finding purpose in the Trump crusade: ‘This is bigger than big’” by Stephanie McCrummen: “On a Friday a year ago, he might have been fixing a gutter. On this Friday, he was setting up a phone bank in a former North Canton (Ohio) tanning salon, becoming part of something that felt every day more like an important, even historic, struggle. It was the moment that Ralph Case had been waiting for since June, when the single father with a one-truck renovation business saw Trump announcing his presidential bid. As Trump spoke of an America that doesn’t ‘have victories anymore’ he felt something stirring– ‘like something hit me in my gut.’ He made the first of dozens of unreturned calls to Trump’s headquarters. He used his own money to rent a defunct tanning salon and plastered its windows with Trump signs. ‘That Ralph guy in Ohio’ was how Trump’s campaign began referring to Case. ‘Chair of Stark County’s Trump campaign,’ was how he referred to himself. ‘This is big,’ Ralph said. ‘This is bigger than big.’” -- “Zika is the latest battle in a long war between humans and mosquitoes,” by Nick Miroff and Brady Dennis: “Ever since a physician proved that mosquitos transmitted yellow fever, humans waged a war on the tiny disease carriers. They drained swamps and cesspools, waged door-to-door campaigns to hunt down breeding sites, and dumped an ocean’s worth of pesticides on multiple continents. But always, through resiliency and adaptability, the mosquito roared back [and] people grew complement. Political willpower faltered. And chemicals lost killing potency … Now comes Zika. Countries are once again calling for massive spraying efforts and r public education. Some are considering new tactics such as genetically engineered mosquitoes that cannot survive to adulthood; the WHO wants such unproven weapons evaluated with ‘particular urgency.’  Relatively few Americans may realize how central such work once was to the nation’s identity. Because these insects carried disease, their extermination became an essential government service, another chapter in the long campaign to tame the wilderness.

 DAYBOOK: On the campaign trail: Fewer events today as candidates watch the returns roll in. Here's the rundown: The AP moves this guidance on when to expect results: “Poll close at 7:30 p.m. EDT in North Carolina and Ohio. North Carolina has lots of early absentee voters, so close to half the ballots could be counted and reported in the first half-hour. Ohio also is a big absentee-vote state, so expect a fast, early count there as well. At 8 p.m., final polls close in Florida, Illinois and Missouri. Since most polls in Florida close at 7 p.m., there will be a lot of votes ready to report right at 8 p.m., allowing for possible early calls on both sides. Illinois and Missouri are slower counting states.” At the White House: President Obama holds a bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland, attends a Friends of Ireland luncheon on Capitol Hill and delivers remarks at a reception for St. Patrick's Day. Vice President Biden attends these events, and meets with First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Northern Ireland in the afternoon. On Capitol Hill: The Senate meets at 10 a.m. The House meets at noon to consider the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act, along with other measures.

Michelle Obama spoke with the Verge about social media in a virtual reality interview: Here's the Hamilton cast performing at the White House: Click to check out Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda freestyling with Obama in the Rose Garden:","THE BIG IDEA: The GOP field could winnow tonight from four candidates to three or two. It is not out of the question that Donald Trump could sweep all five states that vote on this second Super Tuesday: Florida, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Illinois. But a split decision of some kind seems more likely. John Kasich is closing strong and considered the favorite to prevail in his home state. It is a win-or-drop-out situation for Kasich and Marco Rubio. But the stakes are also high for Ted Cruz, who needs to prove that he would be a worthy street fighter in a head-to-head match-up with Trump. “Cruz, who has been boxed out of some news cycles by the media's focus on Trump, is looking to set low expectations, then blow past them,” Dave Weigel reports from Columbus. “He is looking to strong performances in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, the lightly polled megastates lost in recent coverage, to cut any delegate lead Trump might build Tuesday. The first two states border the parts of Iowa that gave Cruz his first victory.” There are 367 Republican delegates at stake. By this time tomorrow, more than half of the total delegates to the convention in Cleveland will have been awarded. -- The question for Democrats: How much of an aberration was Michigan? One of Hillary Clinton’s problems last Tuesday was the complacency of her supporters. This week, polls in every state but Illinois and Missouri again show her with pretty sizable leads. And the action is mostly on the Republican side. The risk again is that her people stay home or take GOP ballots.  Even if Sanders does well, how many delegates does he get? “Multiple polls (show) Sanders closing in on Clinton in three states in the industrial Midwest — Missouri, Illinois and Ohio. But polls also show Clinton far ahead in Florida and in North Carolina, setting up the possibility of an outcome parallel to last week’s contests, when Sanders scored a narrow and surprising victory in Michigan, yet Clinton came away with a widened lead in the delegate count because of her resounding victory in Mississippi,” John Wagner and Jose A. DelReal report. “In other words, Clinton appears poised to continue her progress toward the Democratic nomination, but ever more bloodied by her battles with Sanders.” -- FLORIDA is today’s biggest prize for Republicans, offering 99 delegates in a winner-take-all primary. Though a surprise should not be ruled out, Trump must be recognized as the heavy favorite. He’s led every single poll there this year. A big Trump win here would be a big loss for the anti-Trump efforts, throwing into question the effectiveness of their attacks. Anti-Trump forces have now spent $15.7 million going after him in the Sunshine State, Anu Narayanswamy tabulates from FEC filings.  Will Rubio drop out tonight? Unlike Kasich, the senator has not publicly said he will quit if he loses his home state. His super PAC, which has spent about $10 million in Florida, has not put any money behind ads in the forthcoming primaries, not exactly a show of confidence… (CNN) The Post’s Ed O’Keefe, who is following Rubio now after spending a year chasing Jeb full time, relays from Miami that Rubio is “exhausted” and “a funeral mood” has set in at his events, similar to what cloaked the Bush campaign in its waning days. One data point on why you shouldn’t count out Rubio: Rubio allies are pointing to heavy early voting in Miami-Dade to argue that their turnout operation is better than Trump’s. Nearly 2 million early and absentee ballots have been cast in Florida, including more than 1.1 million Republicans. Those totals include more than 100,000 Republican ballots cast in Rubio’s home county, the Wall Street Journal notes. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who wants to run for governor in 2018 (and could thus potentially face Rubio in a GOP primary), endorsed Trump. She previously backed Jeb Bush, who has stayed conspicuously neutral ahead of today’s primary. (The former governor still blames Rubio for ruining his presidential hopes, and he likely does not believe that weighing in could save his one-time protégé.) Will Trump make inroads with unlikely demographics? The Miami Herald reports that he is faring surprisingly well with Hispanic Republicans: “Cuban Americans in South Florida have the rare opportunity to vote for two of their own for the U.S. presidency. Yet some are making a different choice: They’re backing Trump … There is anecdotal evidence of support among Miami-Dade’s staunchly Republican Cuban-American voters even as most back Rubio — the son of Cuban immigrants — whom many Cuban-American voters helped elect to the U.S. Senate in 2010.” The paper says Cubans don’t care as much about deportation and the border wall. “I don’t think Cuban. I think American. … The worst problem the U.S. has is the economy,” said former Hialeah Mayor Julio Martinez, who convinced his wife who once lived in the U.S. illegally to vote for Trump. -- Does the recent violence scare away any Trump voters?  Early evidence suggests not: A Monmouth University poll published yesterday found that two-thirds of likely Florida GOP primary voters say the events in Chicago have no effect on their view of Trump. The same survey showed Trump leading Rubio by 17 points (44-27), compared to an 8 point lead last week (38-30). Trump’s rivals continued to seize on the drama at his events as they fanned out across the battlegrounds.  Rubio framed the election as “a choice between optimism and fear.” “I don’t think there’s anyone in the history of American politics that compares to the vulgarity of a Donald Trump candidacy,” he told reporters. “In the history of American politics!” (Sean Sullivan) Cruz responded gamely when he was heckled in Peoria, Illinois. ""See sir, one difference between this and a Donald Trump rally is I’m not asking anyone to punch you in the face,"" he said. Trump said there’s a double standard and even denied that there’s been tension. “It’s a love fest. These are love fests,” Trump said at one of his events. Sarah Palin, campaigning for Trump in Florida, decried “petty, punk-ass little thuggery.” She accused the protesters of endangering the First Amendment rights of Trump’s supporters and accused the mainstream media of “being on the thugs’ side.” Meanwhile, a North Carolina sheriff’s office said it will not charge Trump with “inciting a riot” after his raucous rally there last week (where a supporter punched an African American protestor), saying the events do not meet the lawful requirements to support a conviction. (David A. Fahrenthold and Sarah Larimer) OHIO—Kasich’s last stand?  The Buckeye State has 66 delegates at stake in its winner-take-all primary. A final Monmouth poll shows Kasich up 40-35 over Trump, with Cruz at 15 and Rubio at 5. How the final day is playing in the Cleveland Plain Dealer: “Kasich, the state's popular two-term governor, takes the stage at a high school about a mile from his home. There's Mitt Romney by his side … who, when he was the Republican nominee in 2012, received little help or enthusiasm from Kasich. But the former Massachusetts governor didn't join the campaign trail with Kasich out of personal loyalty or because Kasich was his favorite candidate. Romney was trying to save the soul of his party by dragging Kasich across the finish line ... At this moment, he is the GOP establishment's last best hope. And yet it's not the most confident pose for Kasich. He is fighting – harder than he ever thought he would have to – to win Ohio.” Across town, Trump spoke to a few hundred at an aircraft hangar in Youngstown: “The rally was announced less than 24 hours earlier, after the Trump campaign changed its schedule to focus on Ohio.” Does Romney have any juice? Mitt stopped short formally of endorsing Kasich when they campaigned together yesterday at an airplane museum in North Canton. “You’re the ones who are going to decide if he becomes the next president of the United States,” Romney said. “You look at this guy, and unlike the other people running, he has a real track record. He has the kind of record that you want in Washington. That’s why I’m convinced that you’re going to do the right thing tomorrow.” The Columbus Dispatch reports on a surge in Ohio voters who are switching party affiliations: “Through Friday, Franklin County had about 39,000 requests for absentee ballots, and roughly 17,000 came from voters changing their registration. Most of the tide represents unaffiliated voters requesting a partisan ballot. About 5,700 of those so-called independents wanted to vote in the Republican primary while almost 10,000 asked for a Democratic ballot.” -- How potent is the trade issue for Sanders and Trump? It was a big factor in their wins in Michigan last week. The Rust Belt has been hit hard by outsourcing and the decline of manufacturing. Both populists emphasized their opponents’ support for “bad trade deals” yesterday while campaigning in Ohio. ""He signed NAFTA -- NAFTA destroyed Ohio,"" Trump said of Kasich in Youngstown. ""It destroyed Ohio! And now he wants to sign TPP! That is going to be worse. I have studied it so carefully. It's going to be worse for Ohio. It’s going to take all of your car business out. Your car business is going to be destroyed by TPP. He wants it, and nobody knows why he wants it, including himself. Maybe one of his lobbyists is demanding it. Maybe one of the other countries that's going to benefit is demanding it. Who knows? It is completely crazy."" ""Kasich cannot make America great again,"" Trump added. “If you didn't hit oil -- and he didn't have anything to do with that -- this (state) would have been as bad as any of 'em. Oil has gone way down, and yet our budget’s gone up 35 percent, more than any other state in the United States. That means you're gonna have a big, big problem."" “You in Ohio and in the Midwest know about the disastrous trade policies,” Sanders said in Akron, where a once-thriving tire industry has experienced a major decline. “It took me about 13 seconds to figure out that NAFTA was written by corporate America, that its goal was to shut down factories and plants in America, to move abroad to find cheap labor, and bring those products back into America. It didn’t take a PhD to figure that out.” -- ILLINOIS is shaping up to be the marquee contest for Democrats today. It’s a Midwestern state (good for Sanders) and racially diverse (great for Clinton). FiveThirtyEight, which gave Hillary a 99 percent chance of winning Michigan, complains that the polls are skewed, which makes it harder to forecast: A recent Chicago Tribune poll gave Clinton a 42 point lead, while last week’s YouGov poll put Sanders at a 2 point advantage. Watch Chicago. Sanders returned to the Windy City for a late-night election-eve rally – stumping there just a few hours after Clinton and trying to score another in her home state. Did Sanders make the primary a referendum on Rahm Emanuel? The mayor and former White House chief of staff is toxically unpopular, and he’s been on the sidelines. The Vermont senator has aggressively tried to link him with Clinton, Politico reports. The Chicago Sun-Times looks at the last-minute efforts to stop Bernie from catching up: “Bill Clinton hit two black churches— in west suburban Maywood and South Shore — to spur crucial African-American voter turnout. The Clinton campaign sent a team of high-profile surrogates to fan out across the Chicago area after two new polls pointed to the potential of a Sanders’ win in Illinois, turf long seen as solidly for Clinton.” -- NORTH CAROLINA is looking very good for Clinton. If she wins in Florida and North Carolina, Hillary will have won every Southern state. The Charlotte Observer notes that three presidential candidates descended on the city Monday: Sanders rallied supporters at PNC Music Pavilion near UNC Charlotte, while Clinton made a late-night appearance at Grady Cole Center just outside uptown. Though the latest polls put Clinton way ahead of Sanders (56-37), the Vermont Senator hopes to pull another Michigan-style upset by pressing his differences with Clinton over trade. She has racked up endorsements in the Tar Heel State: Clinton has the backing of 44 of the General Assembly’s 61 Democratic lawmakers, including all the Democratic women. And she’s counting on heavy support from African-Americans, who are likely to make up at least a third of the Democratic primary electorate. A record (for a primary) of 56,752 people cast early or absentee ballots in Mecklenburg County, the Observer reports: “Turnout could rival the county’s recent high of 34 percent, set in 2008.” -- Sanders campaigned yesterday in four of the five states that vote today. Florida is the only one he skipped, and it’s because the primary is closed, which means independents won’t be able to vote for him, and there are too many retirees for him to be viable. Clinton has consistently won seniors. -- MISSOURI might be today’s biggest wildcard. It’s hard to know exactly what’s going on in the Show Me State, which offers 71 Democratic delegates and 52 Republican delegates. The state’s lack of polling – coupled with its hard-to-predict open primary system – has kept pundits from making accurate predictions. From the story in this morning’s Post-Dispatch: “The St. Louis area saw Monday appearances by both former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, addressing supporters at a Clayton restaurant; and Sanders, who had a large crowd in St. Charles, his third big rally in the region in the past two weeks. A Post-Dispatch poll last week indicated that Missouri voters in both parties slightly favor the front-runners — Clinton and Trump. But their leads over Sanders and Cruz, respectively, were within the poll’s margins for error, making the races potential nail-biters.” -- Missouri is Cruz’s best shot at a win today. Cruz has done extremely well in the Midwest (think Iowa and Kansas), and he has netted key endorsements from political figures in the state. Rubio’s descent means Cruz will get an even clearer shot at Trump in the state. BUT Missouri’s open primary could make it easier for Trump to win. Independent voters break almost overwhelmingly in support of the populist candidates, and a strong independent turnout would likely boost his campaign to success. Can Cruz consolidate the Stop Trump movement? Trying to be conciliatory, he said yesterday that Kasich and Rubio could both have spots in his cabinet. From Katie Zezima in North Carolina: “As Cruz hopes to narrow the primary to a two-man race, he is increasingly trying to appeal to very different groups: working-class voters who may be drawn to Trump, and political establishment voters who want to stop him. The fit is not a natural one for Cruz, who pillories the establishment … But with Rubio’s candidacy sputtering and Kasich far behind, the establishment is warming to him … ‘It comes down to the reality of a Trump nomination,’ said a [Bush-turned-Cruz] supporter. ‘Trump would be a disaster and an embarrassment for the nation. Ted is the best chance to defeat Trump.’” Funny color: Cruz is bragging on the trail about finishing “dead last” in Saturday’s D.C convention. Fewer than 3,000 voted; Rubio got 10 delegates to nine for Kasich. ""The Washington lobbyists looked at this field and said goodness gracious, give us anybody but Cruz,” he says. It always gets cheers.

 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Hillary was picked up on a hot mic speculating about why Christie endorsed Trump. From Abby Phillip: During a commercial break while taping an MSNBC town hall, Clinton asked host Chris Matthews: ""Why did he support him? ... Did he have a debt?"" Matthews explained that Christie and others who support Trump ""want a future"" politically. He added that Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) ""isn't going anywhere,"" which leaves Christie ""nowhere"" to go. ""I don’t think he would win right now,"" Clinton chimed in.

Some are considering new tactics such as genetically engineered mosquitoes that cannot survive to adulthood; the WHO wants such unproven weapons evaluated with ‘particular urgency.’  Relatively few Americans may realize how central such work once was to the nation’s identity. Because these insects carried disease, their extermination became an essential government service, another chapter in the long campaign to tame the wilderness.

   HOT ON THE LEFT Trump surrogate says Sanders needs to 'meet Jesus.' From Mother Jones: ""A Trump surrogate said during a campaign event Monday morning that Sanders needs to find Jesus. Sanders, of course, is Jewish. Many of his Polish relatives on his father's side were killed during the Holocaust. The comment came at a rally in Hickory, North Carolina, on Monday morning, as Pastor Mark Burns warmed up the crowd ... 'Listen, Bernie gotta get saved, he gotta meet Jesus.

He ran into other problems last month when the Senate Armed Services Committee ruled Carson had violated the federal Vacancies Act by taking on responsibilities of the job prior to his confirmation.""  
  
 DAYBOOK: On the campaign trail: Fewer events today as candidates watch the returns roll in. Here's the rundown: The AP moves this guidance on when to expect results: “Poll close at 7:30 p.m. EDT in North Carolina and Ohio. North Carolina has lots of early absentee voters, so close to half the ballots could be counted and reported in the first half-hour. Ohio also is a big absentee-vote state, so expect a fast, early count there as well. At 8 p.m., final polls close in Florida, Illinois and Missouri. Since most polls in Florida close at 7 p.m., there will be a lot of votes ready to report right at 8 p.m., allowing for possible early calls on both sides. Illinois and Missouri are slower counting states.” At the White House: President Obama holds a bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland, attends a Friends of Ireland luncheon on Capitol Hill and delivers remarks at a reception for St. Patrick's Day. Vice President Biden attends these events, and meets with First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Northern Ireland in the afternoon. On Capitol Hill: The Senate meets at 10 a.m. The House meets at noon to consider the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act, along with other measures.  
  
   QUOTE OF THE DAY:  In Rockford, Ill., Cruz laid out a scenario in which he could not support Trump as the GOP nominee: “If, for example, he were to go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, I would not be willing to support Donald Trump.”

0,"Observers of the bizarre 2016 Republican presidential contest may have thought that the weekend's sudden announcement that Ted Cruz and John Kasich would team up to stop Donald Trump was about as desperate a ploy as we might expect to see. After the New York primary, after all, Cruz joined Kasich in being mathematically blocked from winning a majority of pledged delegates, meaning that the only hope each has to be the party's nominee is to also keep Trump from getting to that mark. That effort collapsed faster than you could say, ""who's partnering with what, now?"" And to add another layer of insult, Trump demolished his two competitors in Tuesday's primaries, making his push for 1,237 delegates that much easier. Desperate ploy, seemingly foiled. But Cruz appears to have another ploy ready to go. As our Robert Costa reports, Cruz will grab a few headlines by preemptively naming his one-time competitor Carly Fiorina as his running mate. This carries only slightly more weight at the moment than if Martin O'Malley were to appoint a secretary of defense, but Cruz isn't doing it for the purposes of ensuring that he's got a strong successor on the long-shot chance that he dies after his long-shot chance at the presidency comes true. The move is blatantly and obviously political -- an attempt to toss one last roadblock in Trump's path before voting ends in the primaries -- with one of the last states to vote being Fiorina's delegate-rich home state of California. It's nearly as transparent a sop to the state as was his little performance about the ""basketball ring"" in Indiana. He couldn't name Ronald Reagan or In-N-Out as a running mate, so why not a California woman? Here's a quick review of how the delegate math in the state works: The winner of California's primary will get 13 statewide delegates, and the winner of each of the 53 congressional districts will get three apiece. This is the sort of system under which Trump has made huge gains in his totals over the course of the campaign, leveraging big wins in South Carolina and New York to pull in nearly all of the delegates in each. Trump's seen a recent spike in his lead statewide, and a recent survey suggested that he held a lead in every region of the state. For Cruz to win at the convention, he needs Trump not to. And for Trump not to, Cruz needs Trump to not win most of the delegates in California. And for that to happen, Cruz needs to shift the vote. Hence Fiorina. Why Fiorina? A few reasons. First, she's a woman. As we've pointed out, Trump does much worse with women (even Republican women) than he does men. In Fox News's most recent poll in the state, though, Trump still leads with women -- just by less. He's up 27 points over Cruz overall, but up 32 with men and only 22 with women. If Cruz can peel away more of that vote, it's to his advantage. Second, she'll likely to appeal to voters in places in California that Cruz doesn't. Fiorina was once the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, one of the founding giant firms of Silicon Valley. She has an appeal to the technocratic, more moderate side of the Republican Party that Cruz lacks, and which at this point seems to lean more toward Kasich than Cruz. (The Capitol Weekly poll linked above had Trump at 39 percent in the Bay Area to Kasich's 25 and Cruz's 23.) Those Bay Area districts are also more heavily Democratic, meaning that it will take fewer votes to win than in other parts of the state. This strategy helped Trump sweep delegates in dark-blue parts of New York state; in California, it will allow Fiorina to blanket her home turf to help Cruz peel those delegates away. Third, she's not unpopular among Republicans. Granted, we don't have recent numbers on Fiorina's favorability (since she was always a long-shot in the 2016 race and polling costs money), but a December Quinnipiac poll had her at plus-35 net favorability nationally. More than half of Republicans viewed her positively and under one-fifth negatively. By contrast, Cruz's most recent net favorability rating, from a Suffolk University poll, had him at plus-15 with Republicans. Sure, she's not as popular nationally, but neither are the likely nominees for each party. And besides, Cruz's goal isn't to spend the next four years working with Fiorina; his goal is to keep the door of possibility open that he might get to spend the next four years doing that. To that end, he needs to stand in Trump's way in California, but so far hasn't had much luck in doing so. So he grabbed the closest Californian. Trump, we will note, seems ready.","Observers of the bizarre 2016 Republican presidential contest may have thought that the weekend's sudden announcement that Ted Cruz and John Kasich would team up to stop Donald Trump was about as desperate a ploy as we might expect to see.

0,"THE BIG IDEA: Desperate times call for desperate measures. If you had any doubt Ted Cruz was desperate, he proved it yesterday by announcing Carly Fiorina as his running mate three months before the Republican National Convention and six days before a win-or-die Indiana primary. The gambit seems unlikely to change the trajectory of the race for 10 reasons: 1. It smacks of presumptuousness. It does not seem principled but political, which goes against the Texas senator’s brand. 2. It is hard to see the announcement dominating more than one news cycle. Cruz lost all five states that voted on Tuesday, finishing in third place behind Donald Trump and John Kasich in four of them. It was quite Trumpian of him to change the subject with a bold stunt. Remember when Trump rolled out the Chris Christie endorsement the morning after his terrible debate performance in Texas? But it feels inevitable that Trump will say or do something today to upstage Cruz’s pick… 3. How many Indiana Republicans are going to decide to vote for Cruz because he tapped Fiorina? Not that many, we’d guess. “Fiorina doesn’t appeal to Kasich voters,” the Manhattan Institute’s Avik Roy argues in Forbes. “For better or worse, Kasich has become the vessel of moderate Republican voters: the suburban, upper-income folks who prefer pragmatism to bomb-throwing. And Fiorina is, at least rhetorically, a Cruz-style firebrand. There’s also the fact that pragmatic conservatives tend to favor someone for veep who has deep experience in governing and legislating, something that Fiorina does not.” Trump said on CNN last night that he believes Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will either endorse him or no one. The Fiorina rollout telegraphs that Cruz does not think he will get the backing of either Pence or Mitch Daniels, the former governor, both of whom would help. 4. This trick has failed every time it has been tried.  In 1976, on the verge of losing the nomination to incumbent President Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan announced Richard Schweiker as his running mate. It angered his core supporters, especially in the South, and did nothing to peel away any delegates from the Pennsylvania senator’s delegation, which was the goal. Schweiker became such a liability that he offered to drop out. Reagan kept him. In 1952, Robert Taft told GOP insiders that he’d pick Douglas MacArthur as his running mate if nominated over Dwight Eisenhower. Time Magazine recalls that this led many to say MacArthur should be the nominee. In 1992, trying to woo African American voters, Jerry Brown said before the New York primary that he’d pick Jesse Jackson as his vice president. But it hurt him badly with the state’s huge Jewish population, the New York Times noted. Bill Clinton won the primary, and then the nomination. Brown wound up finishing third, behind Paul Tsongas, in the Empire State. 5. Fiorina cannot deliver California. The only political contest Fiorina has ever actually won is a 2010 Republican primary in California. But after losing to Barbara Boxer, she actually moved away from the state. I was in New Hampshire last year when a voter told Fiorina how much she loves California. The then-candidate awkwardly responded that she now lives in Virginia and hinted pretty strongly that she doesn’t like the state all that much. “In spite of her California ties, Fiorina does not bring deep connections to activists in that state or elsewhere, with her time in California politics mostly unmoored from the state’s GOP establishment,” Sean Sullivan writes. “That makes her useful in terms of understanding the contours of a statewide campaign and television markets but hardly a rainmaker in terms of delegate accumulation.” As Marty Wilson, who managed Fiorina’s 2010 Senate campaign, told the Los Angeles Times: “Is it a game changer? No, I don’t see it that way.” 6. Fiorina is not actually that talented as a surrogate. “In 2008, she botched her role as a McCain surrogate when she first said his vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, was unqualified to be the CEO of HP, and then added that McCain was, too,” notes Newsweek’s Matthew Cooper. “Her somewhat contorted point—nuanced would be kind—that running a corporation is different from being president got lost in what seemed like a massive diss on the running mates.” 7. Her dismal tenure as CEO at Hewlett Packard, which included a scandal over spying on her board of directors, makes it harder for Cruz to attack Trump over his business record. “It doubles the size of the target. It basically opens the door for your opponents to attack your running mate,” Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney told The Wrap. 8. It deprives Cruz of the chance to name a stronger running mate down the road. Someone like Marco Rubio might have actually helped Cruz carry a state like Florida in November. 9. Cruz has lost a valuable bargaining chip at a contested convention. He might have wanted to create some kind of unity ticket with Kasich, but that possibility is now foreclosed. 10. The mainstream media coverage this morning is pretty brutal and runs heavily negative. It is certainly not what the Cruz camp was hoping for. Reporters are grasping for various metaphors that make it seem like Cruz’s campaign is on the verge of failure: “This is a Hail Mary pass,” writes The Fix’s Chris Cillizza. “It, like the deal that Cruz and Kasich cut earlier this week, amounts to a tacit acknowledgment that if nothing changes in the race Trump is going to win. Could it work? Sure. Sometimes Hail Marys get caught. But usually they get knocked down and the other team starts celebrating.” “Mr. Cruz’s decision … was the political equivalent of a student pulling a fire alarm to avoid an exam: It was certain to draw attention and carried the possibility of meeting its immediate goal, but seemed unlikely to forestall the eventual reckoning,” the New York Times’ Jonathan Martin, Matt Flegenheimer and Alexander Burns write on the front page. “Cruz’s veep selection looks like a half-court shot at the buzzer. That almost never works,” writes the Los Angeles Times’ George Skelton. “Fiorina did perform well in the debates, but couldn’t transform that into votes. And although Fiorina can be very pleasant in person, on the presidential trail she often came across as bitter and a bit mean — not exactly the counterweight Cruz should be looking for.” The Boston Globe's Washington Bureau Chief: “A Fading Cruz Tosses a Hail Carly” is the headline on Fortune. ""Fiorina is Cruz’s latest desperate ploy” is the headline of the New York Post’s story. Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said the move makes no sense on Bloomberg TV. ABC News focuses on the unflattering comments Fiorina made about Cruz when she was a candidate. In that vein, Trump highlighted an old clip of Fiorina on CNN, saying: “Ted Cruz is just like any other politician: he says whatever he needs to say to get elected.” What other reporters across the mainstream media are saying:  Politico: The NYT: Business Insider: -- The Wall Street Journal appears to be the only major outlet playing the move as shrewd. “Positioning himself as down-and-out isn’t necessarily the worst move for Mr. Cruz in Indiana, where the state’s tradition of revering underdogs is celebrated in the movie ‘Hoosiers,’” writes Reid Epstein. “James Bopp Jr., a former member of the Republican National Committee from Terre Haute, Ind., said Mr. Cruz’s naming of Mrs. Fiorina could help him win over business-minded Republicans in the Indianapolis suburbs who had been inclined to back Mr. Kasich before he abandoned the state on Sunday night. ‘She’s not a moderate, but she’s obviously a culturally upscale, successful businesswoman extraordinaire,’ Mr. Bopp said. ‘That has some appeal in the doughnut counties around Indianapolis that are packed with Republicans and upscale Republican voters.’” -- Flashback: Fiorina told Katie Couric she was being sexist last year when the anchor asked whether she was really campaigning to be vice president. “Oh, Katie, would you ask a male candidate that?” Fiorina said. “Yes, I would,” Couric replied. “To a male candidate that was polling at 1 percent, I would ask that question.” (Watch the video here.)

 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- John Boehner absolutely unloaded on Cruz at Stanford last night. In an on-stage interview with Professor David M. Kennedy, the former Speaker said he would vote for Trump in November but not Cruz. “Lucifer in the flesh” is how Boehner described the senator, according to The Stanford Daily. “I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.” From The Stanford Daily’s account: -- The Commerce Department announced this morning that the U.S. economy slowed between the months of January and March, with the gross domestic product expanding at a paltry 0.5 percent pace. ""That roughly matched the expectations of economists, who said the economy was hitting the brakes from the steady but unspectacular pace maintained over the last nine months,"" Chico Harlan reports. The GDP grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the last quarter of 2015."" -- The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce will endorse John Kasich and Hillary Clinton today, the first time the group has waded into a presidential primary. It is a notable snub of the only Hispanic in the race. Javier Palomarez, the chamber's president and CEO, tells Ed O’Keefe in an interview that he knows Cruz from Texas. ""This is not about being Hispanic,"" he said. ""This is about selecting the best person for the job. … I’m heartbroken, heartbroken that I can’t endorse a Latino. … If you look at Ted’s divisive rhetoric about immigrants, it disqualified him from consideration. His inability to work within his own caucus, let alone with Senate Democrats, made it hard for us to consider him. He also pushed for the deportation of up to 12 million people."" -- John McCain has fired one of his fundraisers after a meth-lab was discovered in her home. The Maricopa Sheriff's Office identified one of two people arrested in a drug bust as 34-year-old Emily Pitha, a former member of the staff of retired Sen. Jon Kyl. She’s listed as the RSVP contact on McCain’s invites. “A Maricopa County Sheriff's Office spokesman said authorities were first alerted to possible drug activity at Pitha's Phoenix home by a parcel in transit from the Netherlands containing over 250 grams of MDMA – raw ecstasy,"" the Arizona Republic reports. ""Detective Doug Matteson … said Pitha's boyfriend, 36-year-old Christopher Hustrulid, signed for the packaged when it arrived at their doorstep Tuesday afternoon. Detectives executing a search warrant at the home discovered an active meth lab, along with unspecified quantities of LSD, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, about $7,000 in loose currency, and counterfeit money.""  Statement from McCain manager Ryan O'Daniel: “The campaign immediately terminated any relationship with Ms. Pitha upon learning of her alleged involvement in the operation.” -- John Kerry choked up as he discussed Vietnam at the LBJ presidential library last night. From Carol Morello in Austin: The Secretary of State had to pause to regain control of his emotions while recalling his 1971 testimony before a Senate committee after returning from the war. “I spoke of the determination of veterans to undertake one last mission,” Kerry said, “so that in 30 years, when our brothers went down the street without a leg or an arm and people asked why, we’d be able to say ‘Vietnam’ and not mean a bitter memory…’” He stopped, seeming to choke back tears before completing the thought. -- An airstrike in Aleppo destroyed a Doctors Without Borders hospital, killing at least 14 staff and patients and threatening an already fragile cease-fire between rebels and government forces in the country. (Erin Cunningham) -- Yale announced that it will NOT to change the name of Calhoun College, named for John C. Calhoun, who defended slavery as a “positive good.” As part of a compromise, though, Yale will name a new residential college, opening in the fall of 2017, for Anna Pauline Murray, a lawyer and civil rights activist and the first black woman ordained as a priest in the Episcopalian church, Isaac Stanley-Becker reports. At Princeton, meanwhile, administrators bowed to protestors yesterday by saying they will remove a wall-sized photograph of Woodrow Wilson from a dining hall. GET SMART FAST:​​ SANDERS CONFRONTS REALITY: -- Bernie's campaign is laying off “hundreds” of campaign staffers across the country as the calendar winds down. Sanders was careful to stress he will remain in the race through the party’s convention this summer. But many see the layoffs as a sign of acceptance from Sanders, who appears to be pivoting to run a more progressive and issue-based campaign. The campaign said it would have cut back field staff no matter what happened Tuesday. A spokesman would not specify how many people are being let go, but he said that 325 to 350 people will remain on the payroll. (John Wagner) -- In an interview with The Post’s John Wagner, Sanders said he might start talking “a little more about Trump”: “Not only the degree to which he insults people, but his economic agenda of giving hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to billionaire families like his own.” Sanders said he would like the DNC to lean on all states to open up their primaries to independent voters, who have been a bedrock of Sanders’s coalition when they are allowed to participate. And he would like to see fewer superdelegates: “I think we’ve got to rethink that. Right now, one-fourth of [Clinton’s] entire delegate count is superdelegates. That’s too much. … It is really very hard for a candidate who does really well among ordinary people, who wins primaries and caucuses. You’re starting off with the establishment candidate having 20 percent of the delegates.” (Read the full interview here.) -- The Narrative: In an election defined by anti-establishment energy and anger, the two parties are diverging as Republicans embrace an outsider and Democrats line up behind a quintessential insider. Philip Rucker, Dan Balz and Paul Kane on A1: “The successes of Trump and Clinton underscore important nuances in the sentiments coursing through the two parties. While voters in both share a frustration with the state of the nation’s economy and politics, Republicans blame their own leaders as much as anybody and are eager for a radical fix, whereas Democrats still believe their elected leaders can bring change from within.” As the front-runners begin to pivot towards a general election, each faces far different challenges: Trump, who has tapped into GOP frustrations more than any other candidate, must now unite his fractured party ... “Clinton must demonstrate that a politician with deep establishment roots can channel voters’ simmering anxiety over economic conditions and their dissatisfaction with political elites.” -- Another takeaway from Tuesday's primaries, via Paul Kane: “The sheer amount of money poured into Senate primaries in Pennsylvania and Maryland — $30 million in Democrat-on-Democrat spending — along with the vitriol of the intraparty attacks begs the question about how unified Democrats will be in November. The establishment triumph demonstrates that Democrats have not drifted anywhere close to the upside-down world of Republican primaries … But the unusually caustic nature of the two Democratic slugfests in Pennsylvania and Maryland showed that liberals, particularly well-funded outside groups, are willing to engage in similar death-match tactics to their conservative counterparts.” TRUMP MARCHES ON: -- Trump said “America First” would be the “major and overriding theme” of his foreign policy, Karen DeYoung and Jose A. DelReal report: In a speech yesterday, “Trump charged Obama with direct responsibility for chaos in the Middle East, China’s rise and Russia’s hostility, along with a string of international ‘humiliations.’”  -- Trump broke the 50 percent mark in pledged delegates with his Tuesday night wins. “[His] surprisingly big wins meant that he closed in on 1,237 more than would have been expected, and dropped his magic number -- the percentage he still needs to win -- to about 56 percent,” Philip Bump reports. -- The Donald won at least 39 of the unpledged Pennsylvania delegates, according to a tabulation by  Ed O'Keefe and Katie Zezima .   Though official tallies won’t be known until the party convention in July, unofficial delegate numbers appear to be breaking substantially in Trump’s favor.  -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott called on the “Stop Trump” movement to disband: After endorsing Trump last month, he urged Republicans to accept ""the inevitable.” “Trump is going to be our nominee, and he is going to be on the ballot as the Republican candidate for President,"" said Scott, a possible VP pick for The Donald. (Tampa Bay Times) -- Two senators who earlier backed Rubio got behind Cruz: Colorado's Cory Gardner and Pennsylvania's Pat Toomey.  -- But Trump got basketball coach Bobby Knight to introduce him at his Indianapolis rally.

Inside the administration, there is growing dissension over whether to call Russia out for acting in bad faith."" -- The White House will today unveil a series of new initiatives to improve the way the federal government collects payments on student loans. From Danielle Douglas-Gabriel: “Government agencies are working together to provide the 43 million Americans with student debt more transparent information about the terms of their loans. The Obama administration has given Americans more repayment options so they can avoid default, expanding income-driven plans that require little to no money from people in dire straights, yet the amount of people severely behind on their debt remains stubbornly high. And lawmakers questioned whether student loan servicers are doing enough to keep borrowers current. These companies are paid millions by the federal government to essentially keep people out of default, but GAO researchers found when they reach out to delinquent borrowers, the information is often inconsistent – and 70 percent of people in default actually qualified for a lower monthly payment through an income-based plan.” -- “At Virginia home of President Monroe, a sizable revision of history,” by T. Rees Shapiro: ""For decades, tourists visited the home of James Monroe outside of Charlottesville, and encountered the quaint -- if not underwhelming -- residence. The plantation known as Highland has stood in contrast to Jefferson’s palatial manse … Monroe himself even described his humble abode as a ‘cabin castle,’ and historians interpreted his modesty as a latent expression of his roots as the son of a wood craftsman. But an archeological discovery on the property is rewriting the legacy of Monroe and the place he called home. It turns out that the home preserved on the estate — and marketed for years as the residence where the president laid his head — is in fact a guest quarters. … In other words, the (real) home of Monroe was more castle than cabin and likely ‘in the same order of magnitude’ of Jefferson’s Monticello, said Sara Bon-Harper.” SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Trump (literally) stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last night: Which reminds us of this old series of ads: Sen.

If you had any doubt Ted Cruz was desperate, he proved it yesterday by announcing Carly Fiorina as his running mate three months before the Republican National Convention and six days before a win-or-die Indiana primary. The gambit seems unlikely to change the trajectory of the race for 10 reasons: 1. It smacks of presumptuousness. It does not seem principled but political, which goes against the Texas senator’s brand. 2. It is hard to see the announcement dominating more than one news cycle. Cruz lost all five states that voted on Tuesday, finishing in third place behind Donald Trump and John Kasich in four of them. It was quite Trumpian of him to change the subject with a bold stunt. Remember when Trump rolled out the Chris Christie endorsement the morning after his terrible debate performance in Texas? But it feels inevitable that Trump will say or do something today to upstage Cruz’s pick… 3. How many Indiana Republicans are going to decide to vote for Cruz because he tapped Fiorina? Not that many, we’d guess. “Fiorina doesn’t appeal to Kasich voters,” the Manhattan Institute’s Avik Roy argues in Forbes. “For better or worse, Kasich has become the vessel of moderate Republican voters: the suburban, upper-income folks who prefer pragmatism to bomb-throwing. And Fiorina is, at least rhetorically, a Cruz-style firebrand. There’s also the fact that pragmatic conservatives tend to favor someone for veep who has deep experience in governing and legislating, something that Fiorina does not.” Trump said on CNN last night that he believes Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will either endorse him or no one. The Fiorina rollout telegraphs that Cruz does not think he will get the backing of either Pence or Mitch Daniels, the former governor, both of whom would help. 4. This trick has failed every time it has been tried.  In 1976, on the verge of losing the nomination to incumbent President Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan announced Richard Schweiker as his running mate. It angered his core supporters, especially in the South, and did nothing to peel away any delegates from the Pennsylvania senator’s delegation, which was the goal. Schweiker became such a liability that he offered to drop out. Reagan kept him. In 1952, Robert Taft told GOP insiders that he’d pick Douglas MacArthur as his running mate if nominated over Dwight Eisenhower. Time Magazine recalls that this led many to say MacArthur should be the nominee. In 1992, trying to woo African American voters, Jerry Brown said before the New York primary that he’d pick Jesse Jackson as his vice president. But it hurt him badly with the state’s huge Jewish population, the New York Times noted. Bill Clinton won the primary, and then the nomination. Brown wound up finishing third, behind Paul Tsongas, in the Empire State. 5. Fiorina cannot deliver California. The only political contest Fiorina has ever actually won is a 2010 Republican primary in California. But after losing to Barbara Boxer, she actually moved away from the state. I was in New Hampshire last year when a voter told Fiorina how much she loves California. The then-candidate awkwardly responded that she now lives in Virginia and hinted pretty strongly that she doesn’t like the state all that much. “In spite of her California ties, Fiorina does not bring deep connections to activists in that state or elsewhere, with her time in California politics mostly unmoored from the state’s GOP establishment,” Sean Sullivan writes. “That makes her useful in terms of understanding the contours of a statewide campaign and television markets but hardly a rainmaker in terms of delegate accumulation.” As Marty Wilson, who managed Fiorina’s 2010 Senate campaign, told the Los Angeles Times: “Is it a game changer? No, I don’t see it that way.” 6. Fiorina is not actually that talented as a surrogate. “In 2008, she botched her role as a McCain surrogate when she first said his vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, was unqualified to be the CEO of HP, and then added that McCain was, too,” notes Newsweek’s Matthew Cooper. “Her somewhat contorted point—nuanced would be kind—that running a corporation is different from being president got lost in what seemed like a massive diss on the running mates.” 7. Her dismal tenure as CEO at Hewlett Packard, which included a scandal over spying on her board of directors, makes it harder for Cruz to attack Trump over his business record. “It doubles the size of the target. It basically opens the door for your opponents to attack your running mate,” Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney told The Wrap. 8. It deprives Cruz of the chance to name a stronger running mate down the road. Someone like Marco Rubio might have actually helped Cruz carry a state like Florida in November. 9. Cruz has lost a valuable bargaining chip at a contested convention. He might have wanted to create some kind of unity ticket with Kasich, but that possibility is now foreclosed. 10. The mainstream media coverage this morning is pretty brutal and runs heavily negative. It is certainly not what the Cruz camp was hoping for. Reporters are grasping for various metaphors that make it seem like Cruz’s campaign is on the verge of failure: “This is a Hail Mary pass,” writes The Fix’s Chris Cillizza. “It, like the deal that Cruz and Kasich cut earlier this week, amounts to a tacit acknowledgment that if nothing changes in the race Trump is going to win. Could it work? Sure. Sometimes Hail Marys get caught. But usually they get knocked down and the other team starts celebrating.” “Mr. Cruz’s decision … was the political equivalent of a student pulling a fire alarm to avoid an exam: It was certain to draw attention and carried the possibility of meeting its immediate goal, but seemed unlikely to forestall the eventual reckoning,” the New York Times’ Jonathan Martin, Matt Flegenheimer and Alexander Burns write on the front page. “Cruz’s veep selection looks like a half-court shot at the buzzer. That almost never works,” writes the Los Angeles Times’ George Skelton. “Fiorina did perform well in the debates, but couldn’t transform that into votes. And although Fiorina can be very pleasant in person, on the presidential trail she often came across as bitter and a bit mean — not exactly the counterweight Cruz should be looking for.” The Boston Globe's Washington Bureau Chief: “A Fading Cruz Tosses a Hail Carly” is the headline on Fortune. ""Fiorina is Cruz’s latest desperate ploy” is the headline of the New York Post’s story. Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said the move makes no sense on Bloomberg TV. ABC News focuses on the unflattering comments Fiorina made about Cruz when she was a candidate. In that vein, Trump highlighted an old clip of Fiorina on CNN, saying: “Ted Cruz is just like any other politician: he says whatever he needs to say to get elected.” What other reporters across the mainstream media are saying:  Politico: The NYT: Business Insider: -- The Wall Street Journal appears to be the only major outlet playing the move as shrewd. “Positioning himself as down-and-out isn’t necessarily the worst move for Mr. Cruz in Indiana, where the state’s tradition of revering underdogs is celebrated in the movie ‘Hoosiers,’” writes Reid Epstein. “James Bopp Jr., a former member of the Republican National Committee from Terre Haute, Ind., said Mr. Cruz’s naming of Mrs. Fiorina could help him win over business-minded Republicans in the Indianapolis suburbs who had been inclined to back Mr. Kasich before he abandoned the state on Sunday night. ‘She’s not a moderate, but she’s obviously a culturally upscale, successful businesswoman extraordinaire,’ Mr. Bopp said. ‘That has some appeal in the doughnut counties around Indianapolis that are packed with Republicans and upscale Republican voters.’” -- Flashback: Fiorina told Katie Couric she was being sexist last year when the anchor asked whether she was really campaigning to be vice president. “Oh, Katie, would you ask a male candidate that?” Fiorina said. “Yes, I would,” Couric replied. “To a male candidate that was polling at 1 percent, I would ask that question.” (Watch the video here.)

 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- John Boehner absolutely unloaded on Cruz at Stanford last night. In an on-stage interview with Professor David M. Kennedy, the former Speaker said he would vote for Trump in November but not Cruz. “Lucifer in the flesh” is how Boehner described the senator, according to The Stanford Daily. “I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.” From The Stanford Daily’s account: -- The Commerce Department announced this morning that the U.S. economy slowed between the months of January and March, with the gross domestic product expanding at a paltry 0.5 percent pace. ""That roughly matched the expectations of economists, who said the economy was hitting the brakes from the steady but unspectacular pace maintained over the last nine months,"" Chico Harlan reports. The GDP grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the last quarter of 2015."" -- The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce will endorse John Kasich and Hillary Clinton today, the first time the group has waded into a presidential primary. It is a notable snub of the only Hispanic in the race. Javier Palomarez, the chamber's president and CEO, tells Ed O’Keefe in an interview that he knows Cruz from Texas. ""This is not about being Hispanic,"" he said. ""This is about selecting the best person for the job. … I’m heartbroken, heartbroken that I can’t endorse a Latino. … If you look at Ted’s divisive rhetoric about immigrants, it disqualified him from consideration. His inability to work within his own caucus, let alone with Senate Democrats, made it hard for us to consider him. He also pushed for the deportation of up to 12 million people."" -- John McCain has fired one of his fundraisers after a meth-lab was discovered in her home. The Maricopa Sheriff's Office identified one of two people arrested in a drug bust as 34-year-old Emily Pitha, a former member of the staff of retired Sen. Jon Kyl. She’s listed as the RSVP contact on McCain’s invites. “A Maricopa County Sheriff's Office spokesman said authorities were first alerted to possible drug activity at Pitha's Phoenix home by a parcel in transit from the Netherlands containing over 250 grams of MDMA – raw ecstasy,"" the Arizona Republic reports. ""Detective Doug Matteson … said Pitha's boyfriend, 36-year-old Christopher Hustrulid, signed for the packaged when it arrived at their doorstep Tuesday afternoon. Detectives executing a search warrant at the home discovered an active meth lab, along with unspecified quantities of LSD, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, about $7,000 in loose currency, and counterfeit money.""  Statement from McCain manager Ryan O'Daniel: “The campaign immediately terminated any relationship with Ms. Pitha upon learning of her alleged involvement in the operation.” -- John Kerry choked up as he discussed Vietnam at the LBJ presidential library last night. From Carol Morello in Austin: The Secretary of State had to pause to regain control of his emotions while recalling his 1971 testimony before a Senate committee after returning from the war. “I spoke of the determination of veterans to undertake one last mission,” Kerry said, “so that in 30 years, when our brothers went down the street without a leg or an arm and people asked why, we’d be able to say ‘Vietnam’ and not mean a bitter memory…’” He stopped, seeming to choke back tears before completing the thought. -- An airstrike in Aleppo destroyed a Doctors Without Borders hospital, killing at least 14 staff and patients and threatening an already fragile cease-fire between rebels and government forces in the country. (Erin Cunningham) -- Yale announced that it will NOT to change the name of Calhoun College, named for John C. Calhoun, who defended slavery as a “positive good.” As part of a compromise, though, Yale will name a new residential college, opening in the fall of 2017, for Anna Pauline Murray, a lawyer and civil rights activist and the first black woman ordained as a priest in the Episcopalian church, Isaac Stanley-Becker reports. At Princeton, meanwhile, administrators bowed to protestors yesterday by saying they will remove a wall-sized photograph of Woodrow Wilson from a dining hall. GET SMART FAST:​​ SANDERS CONFRONTS REALITY: -- Bernie's campaign is laying off “hundreds” of campaign staffers across the country as the calendar winds down. Sanders was careful to stress he will remain in the race through the party’s convention this summer. But many see the layoffs as a sign of acceptance from Sanders, who appears to be pivoting to run a more progressive and issue-based campaign. The campaign said it would have cut back field staff no matter what happened Tuesday. A spokesman would not specify how many people are being let go, but he said that 325 to 350 people will remain on the payroll. (John Wagner) -- In an interview with The Post’s John Wagner, Sanders said he might start talking “a little more about Trump”: “Not only the degree to which he insults people, but his economic agenda of giving hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to billionaire families like his own.” Sanders said he would like the DNC to lean on all states to open up their primaries to independent voters, who have been a bedrock of Sanders’s coalition when they are allowed to participate. And he would like to see fewer superdelegates: “I think we’ve got to rethink that. Right now, one-fourth of [Clinton’s] entire delegate count is superdelegates. That’s too much. … It is really very hard for a candidate who does really well among ordinary people, who wins primaries and caucuses. You’re starting off with the establishment candidate having 20 percent of the delegates.” (Read the full interview here.) -- The Narrative: In an election defined by anti-establishment energy and anger, the two parties are diverging as Republicans embrace an outsider and Democrats line up behind a quintessential insider. Philip Rucker, Dan Balz and Paul Kane on A1: “The successes of Trump and Clinton underscore important nuances in the sentiments coursing through the two parties. While voters in both share a frustration with the state of the nation’s economy and politics, Republicans blame their own leaders as much as anybody and are eager for a radical fix, whereas Democrats still believe their elected leaders can bring change from within.” As the front-runners begin to pivot towards a general election, each faces far different challenges: Trump, who has tapped into GOP frustrations more than any other candidate, must now unite his fractured party ... “Clinton must demonstrate that a politician with deep establishment roots can channel voters’ simmering anxiety over economic conditions and their dissatisfaction with political elites.” -- Another takeaway from Tuesday's primaries, via Paul Kane: “The sheer amount of money poured into Senate primaries in Pennsylvania and Maryland — $30 million in Democrat-on-Democrat spending — along with the vitriol of the intraparty attacks begs the question about how unified Democrats will be in November. The establishment triumph demonstrates that Democrats have not drifted anywhere close to the upside-down world of Republican primaries … But the unusually caustic nature of the two Democratic slugfests in Pennsylvania and Maryland showed that liberals, particularly well-funded outside groups, are willing to engage in similar death-match tactics to their conservative counterparts.” TRUMP MARCHES ON: -- Trump said “America First” would be the “major and overriding theme” of his foreign policy, Karen DeYoung and Jose A. DelReal report: In a speech yesterday, “Trump charged Obama with direct responsibility for chaos in the Middle East, China’s rise and Russia’s hostility, along with a string of international ‘humiliations.’”  -- Trump broke the 50 percent mark in pledged delegates with his Tuesday night wins. “[His] surprisingly big wins meant that he closed in on 1,237 more than would have been expected, and dropped his magic number -- the percentage he still needs to win -- to about 56 percent,” Philip Bump reports. -- The Donald won at least 39 of the unpledged Pennsylvania delegates, according to a tabulation by  Ed O'Keefe and Katie Zezima .   Though official tallies won’t be known until the party convention in July, unofficial delegate numbers appear to be breaking substantially in Trump’s favor.  -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott called on the “Stop Trump” movement to disband: After endorsing Trump last month, he urged Republicans to accept ""the inevitable.” “Trump is going to be our nominee, and he is going to be on the ballot as the Republican candidate for President,"" said Scott, a possible VP pick for The Donald. (Tampa Bay Times) -- Two senators who earlier backed Rubio got behind Cruz: Colorado's Cory Gardner and Pennsylvania's Pat Toomey.  -- But Trump got basketball coach Bobby Knight to introduce him at his Indianapolis rally.

Initially I thought she was just trying to lift my spirits. I had told her recently that I did not want to hear any more bad news about my situation, which looked hopeless. It was the day before my 39th birthday and I was at a low point, suffering from the weight of a long-forced isolation, but once she convinced me that it was indeed true, I cried the happiest tears of my captivity and felt strong for the first time in months. It was a turning point for me. The public acknowledgment by Muhammad Ali, one of the most unifying figures in the world, that he believed I was innocent of any wrongdoing meant everything to me. That blow had impact. As he is everywhere, Ali is revered in Iran. The people love him as a champion of sports, but also charity, and authorities have a deep attachment to him as representing their stated ideology of upholding Islamic values and lifting up the oppressed. There’s one problem: He’s American. A domestic Iranian news agency wrote “one of the most astounding moves by the U.S. government and Rezaian’s family was bringing the famed American boxing legend Muhammad Ali, who is very popular in Iran, into Jason’s freedom campaign. They used his popularity to influence Iranian public opinion.” There is an odd truth to this logic, but not the one they intended. After Ali released the statement on my behalf, several of my prison guards told me they had heard about it, and some began to treat me differently — better, and with more respect. I like to think that his words made them doubt the forces who signed their paychecks. Muhammad Ali, considered one of contemporary Islam’s most beloved figures, was always a hero who transcended faith, race and borders. He never belonged to anyone, but he is part of everyone. It is worth noting that in Iran he is, and will always be, known as “Muhammad Ali Clay,” a clear reminder of his pre-Muslim roots, a characteristic trait that in most cases the Islamic Republic refuses to acknowledge. That Muhammad Ali, a black Muslim, is one of our greatest national icons speaks to what is right about this country, and what will continue to perplex Iran, and other Islamic states, about America’s enduring potential and its long reach.","I am one of literally billions of people affected by the life and actions of Muhammad Ali.

1,"Six months after he was released from prison in Iran, PEN Center USA has announced that The Post’s Jason Rezaian will receive the Freedom to Write Award at the center’s Literary Awards Festival gala in September. Willow Bay, director of the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Journalism, will receive the Award of Honor, given to a person or institution that has “made meaningful contributions to the world of writers and journalists.” Rezaian’s 545 days of imprisonment drew international attention to his plight and that of his wife, Yeganeh Salehi. Salehi was arrested along with Rezaian, though she was released on bail, while he remained in Evin Prison. The couple returned to the United States, along with Rezaian’s mother, in January, as part of a deal negotiated to secure the freedom of a number of Iranian Americans who had also been jailed in Iran. Though Rezaian is hardly the only journalist, American or otherwise, to be detained around the world, his case raised important issues about how the United States should respond when American citizens working as journalists are jailed overseas. Marvin Putnam, chair of PEN Center USA’s board of directors, said that he thought it would be difficult to develop “any single, clear foreign policy doctrine” that would govern the American government’s response in these cases. “That said,” he wrote in an email, “abiding by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations as to foreign nationals detained here in the U.S. would probably be a good start, and certainly would go a long way in ensuring that Americans detained abroad receive the Convention’s same protections.” That convention, among other protections, requires that law enforcement officials inform foreign nationals they arrest that they have the right to talk to their representatives at their nation’s consulates, that they be provided the means to mount an adequate defense at trial and that they be treated by the same standards as the citizens of the country in which they’re arrested. The United States ratified the convention in 1969, but human rights advocates suggest that there are multiple occasions on which foreign nationals have been convicted of crimes in cases that did not conform to the articles of the convention. During Rezaian’s detention in Iran, The Post’s lawyers noted numerous ways in which his trial did not meet Iran’s constitutional requirements, and he was denied the opportunity to communicate with consular officials from either the United States or Switzerland; Switzerland’s consulate provides consular services to American citizens in Iran. In recognizing Bay’s work at USC Annenberg and beyond, the PEN Center USA illustrated the rising importance of digital platforms in journalism. Bay has been an anchor for “Good Morning America” and “Moneyline” and a senior strategic adviser for Huffington Post. “A [journalism] school curriculum today must focus on digital platforms,” Putnam wrote. “Technology has changed how we consume the news, and the next technological advances will change it yet again. Virtual reality and immersive journalism appear to be journalism’s next frontier.” Rezaian and Bay will receive their awards at the PEN Center USA’s Literary Awards Festival ceremony in Los Angeles on Sept. 28.","Six months after he was released from prison in Iran, PEN Center USA has announced that The Post’s Jason Rezaian will receive the Freedom to Write Award at the center’s Literary Awards Festival gala in September.

0,"Nearly a week ago, on June 24 , his 45th birthday, Jason Sheats gathered with his family in the living room of their Houston-suburb home about 5 p.m. Beside him were his daughters, Taylor, 22, and Madison, 17. His wife, Christy, had called a family meeting. After years of challenges with Christy’s mental health, her struggles with depression and anxiety, her suicide attempts, Jason told authorities that he thought perhaps she was going to announce she had decided to file for divorce. The couple had talked about separating. But instead, police said, the 42-year-old mother pulled out a .38 caliber handgun, a gift from her late grandfather, and pointed it at her screaming children. Then she shot them, inside the house and out in the street, where the girls collapsed and stopped moving. When law enforcement arrived, they watched Christy fire a final bullet into her eldest daughter, then a police officer shot the mother dead. Jason Sheats walked away physically unscathed. But he was so emotionally distraught, so numb from what he’d witnessed, that authorities hospitalized him anyway. In interviews with police, Jason said he believes that was all part of Christy’s plan. “She wanted him to suffer,” Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls said in a news conference Wednesday. “Christy had ample time to shoot and kill Mr. Sheats in the home but she chose not to. Mr. Sheats stated that Christy knew how much he loved Taylor and Madison, and how much they loved him.” “Mr. Sheats will have to live the rest of his life with this horrible memory,” Nehls said. The Sheats family shooting case has gained attention for almost a week as more details of the tragedy unfold with each passing day. On Tuesday, the sheriff’s office, citing legal obligation, released three disturbing 911 calls from the night of the shooting; one from Taylor, one from Madison and one from a neighbor who watched in horror as Christy retreated back inside the home, her daughters already bleeding in the street, then emerged again with more bullets. The girls, screaming and crying, can be heard begging their mom to stop. In the background, a man’s voice pleads: “I promise you, whatever you want.” Early reports indicated that Christy, described by friends and family online as a loving and proud mother, may have been struggling with mental illness. At Wednesday’s news conference, Nehls confirmed that theory. Sheriff’s deputies had been called out to the house more than a dozen times since 2012, the same year Christy’s elderly grandfather died in Alabama, where he raised her like a daughter. Two months later, her mother died. That’s when her “downward spiral” began, Nehls said, recounting interviews with Jason Sheats. The calls for service varied in substance: Three were after suicide attempts by Christy; two were medical calls; one was a call from the Sheriff’s Office Crisis Intervention Team; another was a verbal altercation. Once, Christy called 911 because she wanted to speak to a deputy. Five of the calls were “false alarms,” the Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. Jason Sheats told investigators that his wife struggled with depression and anxiety and after each suicide attempt had been treated and evaluated at different private mental health facilities. After she stayed several days, Jason told authorities, he would pick Christy up and take her home. At the time of the shooting, Jason said, his wife was taking “numerous” prescription medications. She was also seeing a therapist. Despite information on her LinkedIn profile listing her as the business manager of a Houston tattoo removal clinic, Jason told police his wife did not have a job, according to NBC News. They’d been married for more than 20 years, Jason told authorities, but Christy had been drinking heavily and they’d separated several times. The gun she used to kill her children was inherited from her grandfather, authorities said. Christy had applied for a concealed carry permit, Jason told investigators, but the state of Texas rejected her application. Nehls said at the news conference that his office is investigating why the license was not approved. It was unclear whether it had to do with Christy’s mental health history. From the outside, the Sheats family appeared to be tight-knit and loving. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, friends told local news outlets that Christy and Jason both loved their daughters. The girls were described as happy and kind. In one Facebook post, Christy called Madison and Taylor “very best friends.” Their social media lives reflected the same. Posts on Christy’s wall include drawings from Taylor, an avid and talented artist who attended Lone Star College. She shared photographs of herself and Madison at country music concerts, alongside musings about her faith and support of the Second Amendment. She often tagged her husband in comments and joked with friends. But behind the scenes, Christy, along with her family, was crumbling. Other posts on her social media accounts hint at that. She wrote often about how painful it was to lose her grandfather, a man she called “Pa-paw” and who she credited with teaching her the ways of the world. She called him her best friend, mentor and hero. On anniversaries of his death, Christy would pen lengthy, heartfelt tributes to the man and discuss the emptiness she still felt without him. “Death has a way of reducing us to desperate beggars,” she wrote on June 7, 2015, the three-year anniversary of his death. “They say time heals and the heart recovers but I reject this notion as my heart still grieves and suffers his loss every single day.” She continued: “But 3 years…36 months…1,095 days without seeing his million dollar smile, without his ray of sunshine has felt like my heart has been stranded in the middle of the artic without shelter.” In 2012, she wrote that she felt she’d never get over losing him, “but hopefully one day, my heart will begin to heal.” Her family and friends, including Jason and Taylor, responded with comforting comments. On a post on the two-month anniversary, Christy’s eldest daughter wrote: “He’d want you to not spend your life on sadness, as he brought so much happiness unto us all. Love you and hope you feel better. With time, it may get easier. He’s with you now, and forever.” On Christy’s birthday last year, Taylor surprised her mom with a sea of white balloons marked with happy wishes. “YOU ARE SO LOVED,” one said. At the news conference Wednesday, Nehls said it was an argument with Taylor on Friday that precipitated the killings. Christy and Taylor argued, he said, and the mother wanted to prevent her from seeing her fiance, whom she was scheduled to marry Monday, according to reports. Jason disagreed, arguing it was “inappropriate” to ground their 22-year-old daughter just because of a spat. By the end of the night, everyone but Jason was dead. At the news conference, Nehls said that the father didn’t want to speak publicly about the shootings but had given police permission to share the details about what motivated Christy. “He did state she accomplished what she set out to do,” Nehls said. “And that is to make him suffer.”

0,"THE BIG IDEA:  One of the bigger knocks on Mike Pence when he was in the House, whispered privately among some leading lights of the conservative movement, was that he comes across as inauthentic and a little phony. As a former radio host, he still sometimes talks with a bit of an affect and he’s prone to hyperbole. Lavishing over-the-top praise on Donald Trump over recent days in an effort to become his running mate will only cement this perception. For example, Pence declared last night that, ""Trump understands the frustrations and the hopes of the American people like no other American leader in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan.” This is a laughable comment when you consider that he endorsed Ted Cruz on April 29 — just 10 weeks ago! — ahead of the Indiana primary. If Pence actually believes the above to be true, why didn’t he endorse Trump then? -- Pence risks looking desperate as he all but pleads for the job. During their joint appearance outside Indianapolis, it felt at times like the governor wants to be rescued from having to run for reelection this November. Here is a sampling of his tweets, which prompted jokes online that Trump had gotten ahold of his phone: -- A major reason Pence wants to be Trump's running mate so badly is that he could lose his bid for a second term.  -- All along, the Democratic theory of the case to beat Pence this fall has been to define him as “distracted.” He ran promising to focus on jobs and education, but his tenure has been overshadowed and defined by culture war clashes, from a botched religious freedom bill (which he had to “fix” under pressure) to new restrictions on abortion. Democratic nominee John Gregg launched an attack ad on July 5 that slams Pence for being “asleep at the switch” before Carrier moved hundreds of jobs out of the state: -- Pence’s audition to be Trump’s running mate fits perfectly into this messaging frame, for which voters have already been primed. “You've got to applaud Pence for putting it all on red and publicly begging to leave the governorship for VP,” said the Democratic Governors Association’s Jared Leopold. “But if he doesn't get picked, it's going to be hard for him to look Hoosiers in the eye in November and say he wants to be governor for four more years. This last week cements the perception that Pence has taken his eye off the ball as governor.” -- It’s hard to think of an occasion in recent political history when a candidate campaigned so openly to be VP while facing a competitive reelection themselves. Jeanne Shaheen wanted to be Al Gore’s vice president in 2000 as she sought another term as governor in New Hampshire, but she was not nearly as brazen. In contrast to Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich and Pence — Trump’s three finalists — the leading Democratic contenders to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate — none of whom will otherwise be on the ballot this year — have all done a suitable job at feigning ambivalence and not talking about the vetting process, which is historically what you’re supposed to do (in either party) if you actually want the job. But Trump, first introduced to many Americans in his role as host of NBC’s “The Apprentice,” was enamored with the idea of making his process into a reality-TV-like spectacle. He judged, probably correctly, that it will be a net positive for his campaign. And he clearly enjoys watching professional politicians grovel. ""I don't know if he's going to be your governor or your vice president,” Trump teased a crowd of thousands last night in Westfield after a private, one-on-one sit-down with Pence. “Who the hell knows?"" -- Running for national office as a governor almost always hurts your standing back home. Rather than being seen as a favorite son, invariably you take positions to appeal nationally and to your party’s base that do not jibe well with the parochial interests of your state. Plus, you also spend lots of time on the road. Scott Walker, Rick Perry, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Tim Pawlenty and many more saw their numbers take a hit back home as they hit the hustings in pursuit of the presidency. (To be sure, Christie’s approval rating in New Jersey is much worse than Pence’s, but that’s moot because he’s not going to run for reelection, and Trump will lose the Garden State either way. On the other hand, he needs Indiana’s 11 electoral votes as part of any realistic path to 270.) -- By all accounts, Pence performed well during last night’s tryout. Our Jose A. DelReal, who was there, says his “aggressive and well-received speech … showed he could be an effective surrogate for Trump.” The Pence sound bite that all the morning shows are using: “To paraphrase the director of the FBI, I think it would be 'extremely careless' to elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States.” -- Temperamentally, the even-keeled Pence is in many ways the un-Trump. A favorite line, which he has repeated ad nauseam for years, is that he’s a conservative, but he’s ""not in a bad mood about it.” And that’s exactly why so many Hoosiers are stunned by Pence’s uncharacteristically fiery remarks on Trump’s behalf. “That’s the most exciting I’d ever heard or seen the man,” Lyle Enyeart, a Pence supporter, told the Indianapolis Star last night. “Man, what a ball of fire there.” -- Some of the local news clips have been brutal for the governor. Here are three examples: Indianapolis Star political columnist Matthew Tully writes that “his flirtation … is just the latest in a long series of actions that have made clear Pence’s inability or unwillingness to focus on and adjust to the role of governor. … And there is the dichotomy of a man signing up with the likes of Donald Trump after spending decades portraying himself as driven so much by his moral compass, religion, family values and conservative principles.” The Indianapolis Business Journal editorial page wonders what Pence is thinking: “Is this Pence being baldly ambitious and opportunistic? Or is Pence acting out of a sense of Republican duty? His party is asking him to run and he can’t say no? We don’t know the answer, but it’s disheartening to watch a politician who’s spent a career as a standard-bearer for the conservative Christian movement align himself with Trump’s reckless and misguided campaign.” The Terre Haute Tribune-Star editorial board says Pence’s governorship would come under a microscope if he gets picked: “Such scrutiny would involve the good, the bad and the ugly. This state should be up to the challenge, though. Months of derision and criticism tested Hoosiers following Pence’s handling of the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act.… Three months earlier, Pence’s ill-fated idea to launch a state-run news agency, JustIN, had drawn ridicule as a ‘Pravda on the Plains.’ His rejection of a possible $80 million in federal funding for pre-kindergarten, seemingly to impress the far right of Pence’s party while still a presidential hopeful, hurt more than the state’s image. All of those problems, and undoubtedly others, would be rehashed and illuminated if Trump chooses Pence.” -- If he gets passed over, Pence’s brand will be inextricably linked with Trump’s in a way it would not have been otherwise. As I explained in yesterday’s 202, Democrat Evan Bayh is jumping into the Indiana Senate race because of his confidence that Trump will ultimately prove toxic and that the bottom is still going to fall out from underneath him — even though polls still show the race to be close. On the other hand, some local analysts argue that Trump might outperform Pence on the November ballot — so the friendship is politically beneficial. -- Trump’s announcement is expected to come Friday. That’s also a significant deadline for Pence to withdraw from the governor’s race.  -- What’s Trump’s current thinking? He told the Wall Street Journal yesterday that he’s looking for an “attack dog” running mate “skilled in hand-to-hand combat.” He called Christie and Gingrich “two extraordinary warriors.” He added that chemistry is important. “You either have it or you don’t,” he said. “I clearly have it with Chris and Newt.” As for Pence, the Journal reports that he said he hasn’t seen enough to measure his fighting spirit and their personal chemistry.

 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: THE LONG, HOT SUMMER OF DISCORD AND DISCONTENT DRAGS ON— -- Baton Rouge police arrested three young people who they say were organizing a “credible” attempt to kill officers in a Dallas-style attack. The suspects, ranging from 13 to 20, allegedly stole handguns from a local pawn shop and said they were “looking for bullets."" Cops say this partly explains why they were so heavy-handed with protestors. (CBS News) -- A police officer in Overland Park, Kansas, was fired after threatening a black woman’s 5-year-old daughter on Facebook. “We’ll see how much her life matters soon,” he allegedly wrote, commenting on a picture of the young girl sporting new boots. “Better be careful leaving your info open where she can be found :) hold her close tonight, it’ll be the last time.” An investigation is ongoing. (Lindsey Bever) -- A black dishwasher at Yale University resigned after he admitted to smashing a ""racist, very degrading” stained-glass window on campus that depicted slaves picking cotton. The 38-year-old said he used a broomstick to break the window, which has been at the center of a campus debate about race. (Lindsey Bever) -- The president of Cleveland’s police union threatened to pull his officers from providing security at Cleveland Browns games, after running back Isaiah Crowell posted an image of a policeman getting his throat cut. Union president Stephen Loomis dismissed Crowell’s apology as “store-bought,” and said he would pull his men unless Crowell travels to Dallas to publicly apologize to the victims’ families and “make things right” in person. (Des Bieler) -- A Canadian vocal quartet has cut one of its members after he altered the O Canada lyrics, sung before last night’s MLB All-Star game, to include the phrase “all lives matter.” (CBC) -- In Dallas, President Obama tried to help a heartbroken city heal. “We ask police to do too much and we ask too little of ourselves,” he said during a 40-minute speech, which capped an emotional service just a mile from where five police officers were killed last week. “Even as he spoke of unity, there were still tangible signs of a rift between protesters and police,” Keith L. Alexander, William Wan and Mark Berman report. “Obama was interrupted by applause when he spoke in a concert hall filled with law enforcement officials about those officers killed last Thursday, but the families of those officers did not clap when he spoke about the ‘Black Lives Matter’ protests or invoked the killings in Minnesota and Louisiana.” -- George W. Bush, in a beautiful quote that could be etched in stone, pleaded for unity: “Too often we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions, and this has strained our bonds of understanding and common purpose.” -- Security at the service was especially tight: “Several police officers said they had mentally checked for escape routes, fearing the worst."" -- During the flight down, Obama called family members of Alton Sterling, killed by police in Baton Rouge last week, and Philando Castile, killed in Minnesota a day later. He offered condolences to them on behalf of the American people. Ted Cruz joined POTUS on Air Force One. Organizers kept seats open for the slain officers: -- Trump briefly addressed the Louisiana and Minnesota shootings during his Indiana rally last night: “Appearing to depart from prepared remarks praising law enforcement officials, he called the situation ‘tough to watch’ and raised concerns about the causes of the shootings. ‘We have to figure it out; we have to figure out what is going on. Was it training? Was it something else?’ Trump said. ‘It could have been something else. We have to take care of everybody, remember that.’” (Jose A. DelReal) -- Clinton will deliver a speech at 10:45 a.m. CT/11:45 a.m. ET at the Old State House in Springfield, Illinois, where Abraham Lincoln delivered the “house divided against itself cannot stand” speech. She’s going to try presenting herself as a unifying figure. GET SMART FAST:​​ BAD POLLING FOR HRC: -- Trump now leads Clinton in Florida and Pennsylvania, while the two remain tied in Ohio, according to Quinnipiac University surveys. The polls suggest that James Comey's speech last week has taken a toll on the former Secretary of State: -- Trump also edged out Clinton by 2 points in IOWA (44 percent to 42 percent) in a Monmouth University poll. Both candidates are viewed favorably by exactly 33 percent. Trump leads among independents (39-35). ""It's a toss-up right now, but Iowa could be the leading edge of a Midwest push for Trump,"" said Monmouth polling director Patrick Murray. THE CLINTON EMAIL SAGA WILL NOT END ANYTIME SOON: -- The FBI says it will release “thousands” of recovered Hillary emails to the State Department for potential public release: “Public disclosure of the emails could help resolve the case by Judicial Watch and dozens of other pending public records lawsuits,” Spencer S. Hsu writes. “Depending on what the records contain and how long the review process takes, however, the State Department’s request for records also could prolong legal wrangling that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has tried to put behind her or could push the resolution until after the November election.” -- In an op-ed for today’s Post, Speaker Ryan reiterates his belief that Clinton’s “extraordinary lack of discretion and judgment” should disqualify her from receiving the classified intelligence briefings traditionally given to the two major party nominees -- publicly disagreeing with the Director of National Intelligence. “It’s no small matter to hand over classified information to a person as reckless with our national security as Clinton, absent the voting public’s explicit permission in November,” he writes. “If she is elected, those briefings can resume, allowing her more than two months to be fully briefed before she is sworn in as president. Until that time, given Secretary Clinton’s record of extraordinary lack of discretion and judgment, the risk is just too great.” Yesterday, James Clapper rejected Ryan's request. -- Congressional Republicans are circulating a letter calling on the FBI, IRS, and FTC to launch a public corruption investigation into ties between Clinton Foundation donors and Clinton’s State Department. The letter, authored by Tennessee lawmaker Marsha Blackburn, calls the Clinton Foundation ""a lawless, ‘Pay-to-Play’ enterprise that has been operating under a cloak of philanthropy for years.” (Daily Caller) WHO WILL BE HILLARY'S V.P.? -- Is this an 11th-hour surprise or a head fake from Brooklyn? The Clinton campaign let it be known that retired Navy Adm. James G. Stavridis is being vetted for vice president. Stavridis, 61, served as the supreme allied commander of NATO and ran U.S. European Command from 2009 to 2013. And he chaired the U.S. Naval Institute -- an independent group that serves as an outside ""think tank"" for the U.S. Navy -- after retiring. He now serves as dean of the Law and Diplomacy school at Tufts University. (Abby Phillip) “Stavridis was investigated in 2012 over his use of his expense account, including using a military aircraft to fly with his wife to a party in Burgundy, France,” the Boston Globe’s Annie Linskey notes. “He was cleared of all wrongdoing by a Pentagon inspector general who found that the issues did not amount to misuse of office and instead were due to ‘poor attention to administrative detail.’” But Clinton has a relationship with the former admiral: “Stavridis was copied on a handful of e-mails that were forwarded to Clinton and were contained on her private server,” per the Globe. “He appeared to be involved with Clinton’s Middle East strategy. She was set to attend a private, three-hour dinner held in his honor in July 2012. And there’s some evidence that the two have similar mindsets. While leading NATO, Stavridis would sign off some of his e-mails with the slogan ‘Stronger Together’ — which is now Clinton’s campaign slogan.” Bottom line: Floating Stavridis seems more like Grade-A trolling than a serious trial balloon: Trump has been talking about how much he likes ""the generals,"" and he was genuinely interested in Michael Flynn until his disastrous appearance Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" Clinton, who was on the Armed Services committee during her time in the Senate, has deeper relationships with way more brass than Trump, and this might be a way of showcasing that reality. Also, this guy ran NATO, which Trump actively antagonizes on the stump. Ultimately, HRC is a political animal and it's almost inconceivable to see her either going a non-political route or taking a risk on someone who has not been tested. -- In what was widely interpreted as a signal that Elizabeth Warren will not be picked as Clinton's running-mate, the Massachusetts senator was invited to speak during the first night of the Democratic convention. But, but, but: CNN's Jeff Zeleny says the convention schedule is still operating on a separate track from the veep vetting, and she could easily be swapped with someone else. (John Edwards was announced as an early convention speaker in 2004, but that changed after John Kerry tapped him.) -- Hillary will meet with Senate Democrats during their Thursday caucus lunch in the Capitol, just before members leave town for a long recess. They can already smell the jet fumes... -- “Cory Booker Gets Vetted, By Himself,” by BuzzFeed's Ruby Cramer: The 47-year-old has never fit the profile of a regular politician. ""He’s a Stanford football player who quoted poetry in his campus newspaper column; a black Baptist who led the Oxford Jewish club; a suburban-born Yale Law grad with a relentless passion for a city that didn’t always love him back. … He talks in big lofty language about the ‘arc of history’ and ‘conspiracy of love.’ But the loose, freewheeling style that helped form Booker’s political identity didn’t translate easily to his 2013 U.S. Senate race, when stories he’d been telling for years suddenly came under fire. [Staples of his stump speech were verifiably false or could not be corroborated.] ... The experience left him a little rattled, a little wary of a media environment where, he says, people try to ‘bring folk down.’ But it was that race, according to his aides, that helped push Booker to become more disciplined and measured. … Booker, determined to avoid the missteps of 2013, now goes by a new rule. ‘Every story I tell, I’m going to find second and third sources.'"" THE DAILY DONALD: -- Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has continued to lob attacks at Trump this week, calling him a “faker” and saying she is surprised the media has not pressed him harder to release his tax returns. (Robert Barnes) Trump responded by calling for her resignation and last night suggested that she is senile:  -- The editorial boards of The Post and the New York Times both chastise Ginsburg this morning. We cannot recall seeing ""Trump is right"" on the Times's editorial page so far this year, but the paper says the justice ""needs to drop the political punditry and the name-calling."" The Post's board -- independent from the news division -- is more gentle but nonetheless stern: ""However valid her comments may have been ... and however in keeping with her known political bent, they were still much, much better left unsaid by a member of the Supreme Court. ... Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts.""  -- Intel’s CEO canceled a planned meeting with Trump when his campaign tried to turn it into a fundraiser. Brian “Krzanich said he’d originally scheduled a gathering at his home to discuss issues important to Intel and himself with Trump,” Bloomberg’s Ian King reports. “It turned into a fundraiser, which is when we backed out,” he said. “It was supposed to be a conversation about issues.” The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. -- The Donald declined an invitation to speak at the NAACP convention in Cincinnati, skipping a prominent civil rights conference that both major party nominees typically address. ""The explanation given was that they're holding their convention at the same time,"" NAACP leader Cornell William Brooks said on CNN. ""We, of course, are in Cincinnati. They are in Cleveland. We were hoping he would make the short trip from Cleveland to Cincinnati."" (Jenna Johnson) -- Eric Trump said he cannot remember a single instance when his father donated “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in personal money to charity, after repeatedly making that claim in a series of interviews last week. ""I’m sure there have been but without going back through 10 years, I wouldn’t remember check for check off the top of my head,"" the candidate's son told David Fahrenthold – who has been doggedly pursuing the story – in an email. “As the day went on, Eric Trump was pressed to explain the contrast with his own statements from a few days before. Why had he asserted that his father had given his charity hundreds of thousands of dollars, if now he didn't remember it ever happening?” In response, Eric Trump said he was too busy to look for any evidence that would corroborate his claims: “I have a lot going on — I just don't have the time. Good luck with the story,” he wrote. “Those comments undermine what was — for a few days — the strongest testimonial about Donald Trump's recent giving to charity.” -- Clinton ally David Brock will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. to announce that an anonymous Republican has offered to contribute $5 MILLION to a veteran’s charity of Trump’s choosing if the presumptive GOP nominee releases his tax returns. Trump has given varying excuses for refusing to release his returns, as every major party nominee for a generation has done. -- New York Times, “For Whites Sensing Decline, Trump Unleashes Words of Resistance,” by Nicholas Confessore: “The resentment among whites feels both old and distinctly of this moment. It is shaped by the reality of demographic change, by a decade and a half of war in the Middle East, and by unease with the newly confident and confrontational activism of young blacks furious over police violence. It is mingled with patriotism, pride, fear and a sense that an America without them at its center is not really America anymore. … In a country where the wealthiest and most influential citizens are still mostly white, Mr. Trump is voicing the bewilderment and anger of whites who do not feel at all powerful or privileged. But in doing so, Mr. Trump has also opened the door to assertions of white identity and resentment in a way not seen so broadly in American culture in over half a century. … Dozens of interviews … suggest that the passions aroused and channeled by Mr. Trump take many forms, from earnest if muddled rebellion to deeper and more elaborate bigotry.” -- David Duke is considering launching a congressional bid against Steve Scalise in Louisiana: The former KKK grand wizard said he has set up an exploratory committee and is “heavily leaning” towards challenging the House Majority Whip. He said he will make a final decision in the next few days. (Daily Beast) -- A Trump University course advised students on how they could profit by targeting destitute, “completely disabled” homeowners in pre-foreclosure. From Mother Jones’ Patrick Caldwell: ""The 2006 course, which Trump vowed would offer a 'real estate gold mine,' features tips from real estate investment adviser Gary Eldred about how to best exploit homeowners facing foreclosures. The goal, Eldred says, is to find homeowners who are in a truly desperate financial position. ‘Under no circumstance will a lender accept a short sale if they think they can squeeze that borrower for an extra nickel,’ he explains. He lists the conditions that are ideal for a short sale: ‘The borrower is out of work, the borrower has $50,000 in unpaid medical claims, the borrow is completely disabled, the borrower has an extraordinarily messy divorce where everything has been squandered.’” Trump echoed these sentiments in a taped introduction for the course: “I’m sorry for them, but life goes on,” he said of desperate property owners. “And the fact is, one person's misfortune is someone else's opportunity.” THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION STARTS IN FIVE DAYS: -- “GOP moves closer to the base, and away from the broader public, in party platform,"" by Ed O'Keefe and Dan Balz: The Republican Party firmly embraced conservative orthodoxy on abortion, gay rights, gun rights and immigration during its platform committee meetings in Cleveland. “Among the specific policies the platform committee endorsed is a ‘border wall’ that would cover ‘the entirety of the Southern Border.' ... On abortion, the committee added the full text of the Hyde Amendment — which bans the use of federal funding for all forms of the procedure — to the platform. The panel also included support for ‘religious freedom’ laws and made changes to reinforce its support for traditional marriage.""  The victory of the RNC hardliners comes as public opinion continues to inch away from them, especially on social issues: “Approval of legal abortion jumped from 51 percent to 58 percent in 2015. … A record-high six in 10 Americans support same-sex marriage [and] a CNN/ORC poll released in May found that a majority of Americans don’t agree with so-called bathroom bills.  … Regardless, few members of the platform committee spoke in opposition to any of the proposals.” -- The New Black Panther Party announced that its members will carry guns for self-defense during rallies outside the RNC next week: ""If it is an open state to carry, we will exercise our second amendment rights because there are other groups threatening to be there that are threatening to do harm to us,"" said Panthers leader Hashim Nzinga. Ohio officials have said it will be legal for protesters to carry weapons in accordance with the state’s open carry laws, so long as protesters remain outside the convention perimeter. (Reuters) -- Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy said Cleveland police are “ready,” officially deeming the city police force well-equipped to handle any potential fracas. (Plain Dealer) -- Rudy Giuliani is expected to speak at the GOP convention and could earn a prime opening-night time slot, according to Politico. The former New York City mayor’s rumored speech comes in the wake of his inflammatory comments about Black Lives Matter activists Sunday, but party leaders are struggling to book big names for Trump’s coronation. -- Mitch McConnell said he plans to speak. -- Ryan, who will chair the convention, repeatedly defended his endorsement of Trump during a CNN town hall last night. ""It is a binary choice,"" the Speaker said. ""It is either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. You don't get a third option."" -- Ted Cruz will travel to Cleveland this Friday to address a closed-door meeting of movement conservative leaders ahead of the convention. “Cruz will speak to a gathering of the Council for National Policy, a secretive group … many of whom backed the Texas senator in his failed presidential bid,” per Politico’s Shane Goldmacher. “The CNP is a nonprofit, but some of its members, including Tony Perkins, who also serves as head of the Family Research Council, are part of a subgroup that had voted to endorse Cruz in hopes of uniting the movement behind a single candidate in 2016 … The closed-door speech also represents a chance for Cruz to stay in the good graces of [activists] who could power a 2020 presidential run.” The RNC rules committee also meets Friday. This is where Stop Trump Republicans are expected to make their last-ditch effort to block him from the nomination. (Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier says Cruz plans to appear only at the CNP gathering, not at any RNC meetings.) -- The governor of Texas confirmed he will stay home. Greg Abbott, who suffered severe burns while vacationing in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last week, is in the hospital recovering from a skin graft procedure. (Austin American-Statesman) -- BuzzFeed is hosting a party for reporters from the dozen media organizations that have been blacklisted from being credentialed to cover Trump events. (Huffington Post's Michael Calderone) THE DEMOCRATIC DENOUEMENT: -- Sanders pledged to support Clinton during a “boisterous, but at times awkward rally” in New Hampshire. ""She will be the Democratic nominee for president, and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States,"" the senator from Vermont said. Speaking directly to Sanders’s supporters, Clinton welcomed them to her campaign and encouraged them to “make it your own.” “You will always have a seat at the table when I am in the White House,” she said. Clinton and Sanders took the stage to a Bruce Springsteen anthem that was standard at his rallies, John Wagner flags. -- Wasting no time, Sanders is preparing to launch “as many as three” organizations to continue the efforts of his campaign. “One will be devoted to policy formulation. A second will focus on recruiting and training candidates. And a third might engage in other political activity, possibly registering as a political action committee,"" Wagner reports. Campaign manager Jeff Weaver said he expects the organizations “to be up and running in a matter of weeks, with the aim of fully participating in the fall elections.” -- “DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz seems safe until November,” by CNN’s Manu Raju: There were discussions about replacing her, including with Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin. ""But those talks didn't pick up much steam, sources said, with Clinton showing little appetite to boot Wasserman Schultz and cause a distraction, while Sanders focused his energy instead on influencing the party platform. When Clinton took over the DNC last month, the campaign named Brandon Davis, a former national political director for the Services Employees International Union, as the chief of staff, giving him day-to-day control over the operation and effectively limiting the role of the Florida Democrat. Now ... there seems to be little appetite for a drawn-out committee fight over naming a replacement."" -- “Democrats make education revisions to 2016 platform — and a key reformer is furious,” by Valerie Strauss: “In an unexpected move, Democrats revised the K-12 education section of their party’s 2016 platform in important ways, backing the right of parents to opt their children out of high-stakes standardized tests, qualifying support for charter schools, and opposing using test scores for high-stakes purposes to evaluate teachers and students. Some of the changes are being welcomed by public school advocates who have been fighting corporate school reform, which includes standardized test-based accountability systems and the expansion of charter schools. Many of these activists have been worried that Clinton … would back corporate reform, just as the Obama administration has. While it isn’t clear exactly what she will do if she becomes president — as platform language does not necessarily translate into policy — supporters of those reforms are furious at the changes, highlighting a rift in the party over how to improve K-12 education.” WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: -- “Inside ISIS: Quietly preparing for the loss of the ‘caliphate’,” by Joby Warrick and Souad Mekhennet: “Even as it launches waves of terrorist attacks around the globe, the Islamic State is quietly preparing its followers for the eventual collapse of the caliphate it proclaimed with great fanfare two years ago. In public messages and in recent actions in Syria, the group’s leaders are acknowledging the terrorist organization’s declining fortunes on the battlefield while bracing for the possibility that its remaining strongholds could fall. U.S. counterterrorism experts believe the mass ­casualty attacks in Istanbul and Baghdad in the past month were largely a response to military reversals in Iraq and Syria. Such terrorist acts are likely to continue and even intensify … as the group evolves from a quasi-state with territorial holdings to a shadowy and diffuse network with branches and cells on at least three continents.” Alarming quote, from an Islamic State operative: “We do have, every day, people reaching out and telling us they want to come to the caliphate. But we tell them to stay in their countries and rather wait to do something there.” -- “Cash-strapped Rio state says Olympics will be fine. But what about afterward?,” by Dom Phillips: “The state of Rio is so broke it is selling off the governor’s summer residence and the small island it sits on. But because of a recent federal government bailout, officials insist, the Summer Olympics will go just fine. The problem is what happens after the Games. … Rio is running a deficit of about $6 billion a year ... and has lurched from one crisis to another since last year, when state hospitals ran out of basic supplies. Now, officials say, everything is in place for Rio to stage a memorable Olympics — although many observers doubt even that. Less than a month before the Games begin, some emergency health centers have reduced their hours and are struggling to pay suppliers. Police and firefighters have twice staged demonstrations at Rio’s international airport, warning that visitors’ safety cannot be guaranteed and protesting still-unpaid salaries. 'This was for us to work during the Olympics, to shut us up,' said one officer. 'We don’t know what will happen afterward.'"" -- “Colombia offers the possibility that the Zika epidemic may not be as bad as feared,” by Nick Miroff: “In the nine months since the Zika virus appeared in Colombia, the government has reported nearly 100,000 cases, including more than 17,000 pregnant women. But the epidemic has not produced the dreaded wave of fetal deformities witnessed in Brazil. Brazilian health officials blame the virus for at least 1,600 cases of the birth defect microcephaly, and they are investigating another 3,000 for a link to Zika. In Colombia, the country that has logged the second-highest number of infections, authorities have linked Zika to 18 cases of microcephaly, with 112 under investigation.The fact that Colombia has seen a relatively modest — not massive — increase in birth defects raises some hopes that the threat of microcephaly from Zika is not as high"" as previously expected.

As a former radio host, he still sometimes talks with a bit of an affect and he’s prone to hyperbole. Lavishing over-the-top praise on Donald Trump over recent days in an effort to become his running mate will only cement this perception. For example, Pence declared last night that, ""Trump understands the frustrations and the hopes of the American people like no other American leader in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan.” This is a laughable comment when you consider that he endorsed Ted Cruz on April 29 — just 10 weeks ago! — ahead of the Indiana primary. If Pence actually believes the above to be true, why didn’t he endorse Trump then? -- Pence risks looking desperate as he all but pleads for the job. During their joint appearance outside Indianapolis, it felt at times like the governor wants to be rescued from having to run for reelection this November. Here is a sampling of his tweets, which prompted jokes online that Trump had gotten ahold of his phone: -- A major reason Pence wants to be Trump's running mate so badly is that he could lose his bid for a second term.  -- All along, the Democratic theory of the case to beat Pence this fall has been to define him as “distracted.” He ran promising to focus on jobs and education, but his tenure has been overshadowed and defined by culture war clashes, from a botched religious freedom bill (which he had to “fix” under pressure) to new restrictions on abortion. Democratic nominee John Gregg launched an attack ad on July 5 that slams Pence for being “asleep at the switch” before Carrier moved hundreds of jobs out of the state: -- Pence’s audition to be Trump’s running mate fits perfectly into this messaging frame, for which voters have already been primed. “You've got to applaud Pence for putting it all on red and publicly begging to leave the governorship for VP,” said the Democratic Governors Association’s Jared Leopold. “But if he doesn't get picked, it's going to be hard for him to look Hoosiers in the eye in November and say he wants to be governor for four more years. This last week cements the perception that Pence has taken his eye off the ball as governor.” -- It’s hard to think of an occasion in recent political history when a candidate campaigned so openly to be VP while facing a competitive reelection themselves. Jeanne Shaheen wanted to be Al Gore’s vice president in 2000 as she sought another term as governor in New Hampshire, but she was not nearly as brazen. In contrast to Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich and Pence — Trump’s three finalists — the leading Democratic contenders to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate — none of whom will otherwise be on the ballot this year — have all done a suitable job at feigning ambivalence and not talking about the vetting process, which is historically what you’re supposed to do (in either party) if you actually want the job. But Trump, first introduced to many Americans in his role as host of NBC’s “The Apprentice,” was enamored with the idea of making his process into a reality-TV-like spectacle. He judged, probably correctly, that it will be a net positive for his campaign. And he clearly enjoys watching professional politicians grovel. ""I don't know if he's going to be your governor or your vice president,” Trump teased a crowd of thousands last night in Westfield after a private, one-on-one sit-down with Pence. “Who the hell knows?"" -- Running for national office as a governor almost always hurts your standing back home. Rather than being seen as a favorite son, invariably you take positions to appeal nationally and to your party’s base that do not jibe well with the parochial interests of your state. Plus, you also spend lots of time on the road. Scott Walker, Rick Perry, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Tim Pawlenty and many more saw their numbers take a hit back home as they hit the hustings in pursuit of the presidency. (To be sure, Christie’s approval rating in New Jersey is much worse than Pence’s, but that’s moot because he’s not going to run for reelection, and Trump will lose the Garden State either way. On the other hand, he needs Indiana’s 11 electoral votes as part of any realistic path to 270.) -- By all accounts, Pence performed well during last night’s tryout. Our Jose A. DelReal, who was there, says his “aggressive and well-received speech … showed he could be an effective surrogate for Trump.” The Pence sound bite that all the morning shows are using: “To paraphrase the director of the FBI, I think it would be 'extremely careless' to elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States.” -- Temperamentally, the even-keeled Pence is in many ways the un-Trump. A favorite line, which he has repeated ad nauseam for years, is that he’s a conservative, but he’s ""not in a bad mood about it.” And that’s exactly why so many Hoosiers are stunned by Pence’s uncharacteristically fiery remarks on Trump’s behalf. “That’s the most exciting I’d ever heard or seen the man,” Lyle Enyeart, a Pence supporter, told the Indianapolis Star last night. “Man, what a ball of fire there.” -- Some of the local news clips have been brutal for the governor. Here are three examples: Indianapolis Star political columnist Matthew Tully writes that “his flirtation … is just the latest in a long series of actions that have made clear Pence’s inability or unwillingness to focus on and adjust to the role of governor. … And there is the dichotomy of a man signing up with the likes of Donald Trump after spending decades portraying himself as driven so much by his moral compass, religion, family values and conservative principles.” The Indianapolis Business Journal editorial page wonders what Pence is thinking: “Is this Pence being baldly ambitious and opportunistic? Or is Pence acting out of a sense of Republican duty? His party is asking him to run and he can’t say no? We don’t know the answer, but it’s disheartening to watch a politician who’s spent a career as a standard-bearer for the conservative Christian movement align himself with Trump’s reckless and misguided campaign.” The Terre Haute Tribune-Star editorial board says Pence’s governorship would come under a microscope if he gets picked: “Such scrutiny would involve the good, the bad and the ugly. This state should be up to the challenge, though. Months of derision and criticism tested Hoosiers following Pence’s handling of the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act.… Three months earlier, Pence’s ill-fated idea to launch a state-run news agency, JustIN, had drawn ridicule as a ‘Pravda on the Plains.’ His rejection of a possible $80 million in federal funding for pre-kindergarten, seemingly to impress the far right of Pence’s party while still a presidential hopeful, hurt more than the state’s image. All of those problems, and undoubtedly others, would be rehashed and illuminated if Trump chooses Pence.” -- If he gets passed over, Pence’s brand will be inextricably linked with Trump’s in a way it would not have been otherwise. As I explained in yesterday’s 202, Democrat Evan Bayh is jumping into the Indiana Senate race because of his confidence that Trump will ultimately prove toxic and that the bottom is still going to fall out from underneath him — even though polls still show the race to be close. On the other hand, some local analysts argue that Trump might outperform Pence on the November ballot — so the friendship is politically beneficial. -- Trump’s announcement is expected to come Friday. That’s also a significant deadline for Pence to withdraw from the governor’s race.  -- What’s Trump’s current thinking? He told the Wall Street Journal yesterday that he’s looking for an “attack dog” running mate “skilled in hand-to-hand combat.” He called Christie and Gingrich “two extraordinary warriors.” He added that chemistry is important. “You either have it or you don’t,” he said. “I clearly have it with Chris and Newt.” As for Pence, the Journal reports that he said he hasn’t seen enough to measure his fighting spirit and their personal chemistry.

 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: THE LONG, HOT SUMMER OF DISCORD AND DISCONTENT DRAGS ON— -- Baton Rouge police arrested three young people who they say were organizing a “credible” attempt to kill officers in a Dallas-style attack. The suspects, ranging from 13 to 20, allegedly stole handguns from a local pawn shop and said they were “looking for bullets."" Cops say this partly explains why they were so heavy-handed with protestors. (CBS News) -- A police officer in Overland Park, Kansas, was fired after threatening a black woman’s 5-year-old daughter on Facebook. “We’ll see how much her life matters soon,” he allegedly wrote, commenting on a picture of the young girl sporting new boots. “Better be careful leaving your info open where she can be found :) hold her close tonight, it’ll be the last time.” An investigation is ongoing. (Lindsey Bever) -- A black dishwasher at Yale University resigned after he admitted to smashing a ""racist, very degrading” stained-glass window on campus that depicted slaves picking cotton. The 38-year-old said he used a broomstick to break the window, which has been at the center of a campus debate about race. (Lindsey Bever) -- The president of Cleveland’s police union threatened to pull his officers from providing security at Cleveland Browns games, after running back Isaiah Crowell posted an image of a policeman getting his throat cut. Union president Stephen Loomis dismissed Crowell’s apology as “store-bought,” and said he would pull his men unless Crowell travels to Dallas to publicly apologize to the victims’ families and “make things right” in person. (Des Bieler) -- A Canadian vocal quartet has cut one of its members after he altered the O Canada lyrics, sung before last night’s MLB All-Star game, to include the phrase “all lives matter.” (CBC) -- In Dallas, President Obama tried to help a heartbroken city heal. “We ask police to do too much and we ask too little of ourselves,” he said during a 40-minute speech, which capped an emotional service just a mile from where five police officers were killed last week. “Even as he spoke of unity, there were still tangible signs of a rift between protesters and police,” Keith L. Alexander, William Wan and Mark Berman report. “Obama was interrupted by applause when he spoke in a concert hall filled with law enforcement officials about those officers killed last Thursday, but the families of those officers did not clap when he spoke about the ‘Black Lives Matter’ protests or invoked the killings in Minnesota and Louisiana.” -- George W. Bush, in a beautiful quote that could be etched in stone, pleaded for unity: “Too often we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions, and this has strained our bonds of understanding and common purpose.” -- Security at the service was especially tight: “Several police officers said they had mentally checked for escape routes, fearing the worst."" -- During the flight down, Obama called family members of Alton Sterling, killed by police in Baton Rouge last week, and Philando Castile, killed in Minnesota a day later. He offered condolences to them on behalf of the American people. Ted Cruz joined POTUS on Air Force One. Organizers kept seats open for the slain officers: -- Trump briefly addressed the Louisiana and Minnesota shootings during his Indiana rally last night: “Appearing to depart from prepared remarks praising law enforcement officials, he called the situation ‘tough to watch’ and raised concerns about the causes of the shootings. ‘We have to figure it out; we have to figure out what is going on. Was it training? Was it something else?’ Trump said. ‘It could have been something else. We have to take care of everybody, remember that.’” (Jose A. DelReal) -- Clinton will deliver a speech at 10:45 a.m. CT/11:45 a.m. ET at the Old State House in Springfield, Illinois, where Abraham Lincoln delivered the “house divided against itself cannot stand” speech. She’s going to try presenting herself as a unifying figure. GET SMART FAST:​​ BAD POLLING FOR HRC: -- Trump now leads Clinton in Florida and Pennsylvania, while the two remain tied in Ohio, according to Quinnipiac University surveys. The polls suggest that James Comey's speech last week has taken a toll on the former Secretary of State: -- Trump also edged out Clinton by 2 points in IOWA (44 percent to 42 percent) in a Monmouth University poll. Both candidates are viewed favorably by exactly 33 percent. Trump leads among independents (39-35). ""It's a toss-up right now, but Iowa could be the leading edge of a Midwest push for Trump,"" said Monmouth polling director Patrick Murray. THE CLINTON EMAIL SAGA WILL NOT END ANYTIME SOON: -- The FBI says it will release “thousands” of recovered Hillary emails to the State Department for potential public release: “Public disclosure of the emails could help resolve the case by Judicial Watch and dozens of other pending public records lawsuits,” Spencer S. Hsu writes. “Depending on what the records contain and how long the review process takes, however, the State Department’s request for records also could prolong legal wrangling that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has tried to put behind her or could push the resolution until after the November election.” -- In an op-ed for today’s Post, Speaker Ryan reiterates his belief that Clinton’s “extraordinary lack of discretion and judgment” should disqualify her from receiving the classified intelligence briefings traditionally given to the two major party nominees -- publicly disagreeing with the Director of National Intelligence. “It’s no small matter to hand over classified information to a person as reckless with our national security as Clinton, absent the voting public’s explicit permission in November,” he writes. “If she is elected, those briefings can resume, allowing her more than two months to be fully briefed before she is sworn in as president. Until that time, given Secretary Clinton’s record of extraordinary lack of discretion and judgment, the risk is just too great.” Yesterday, James Clapper rejected Ryan's request. -- Congressional Republicans are circulating a letter calling on the FBI, IRS, and FTC to launch a public corruption investigation into ties between Clinton Foundation donors and Clinton’s State Department. The letter, authored by Tennessee lawmaker Marsha Blackburn, calls the Clinton Foundation ""a lawless, ‘Pay-to-Play’ enterprise that has been operating under a cloak of philanthropy for years.” (Daily Caller) WHO WILL BE HILLARY'S V.P.? -- Is this an 11th-hour surprise or a head fake from Brooklyn? The Clinton campaign let it be known that retired Navy Adm. James G. Stavridis is being vetted for vice president. Stavridis, 61, served as the supreme allied commander of NATO and ran U.S. European Command from 2009 to 2013. And he chaired the U.S. Naval Institute -- an independent group that serves as an outside ""think tank"" for the U.S. Navy -- after retiring. He now serves as dean of the Law and Diplomacy school at Tufts University. (Abby Phillip) “Stavridis was investigated in 2012 over his use of his expense account, including using a military aircraft to fly with his wife to a party in Burgundy, France,” the Boston Globe’s Annie Linskey notes. “He was cleared of all wrongdoing by a Pentagon inspector general who found that the issues did not amount to misuse of office and instead were due to ‘poor attention to administrative detail.’” But Clinton has a relationship with the former admiral: “Stavridis was copied on a handful of e-mails that were forwarded to Clinton and were contained on her private server,” per the Globe. “He appeared to be involved with Clinton’s Middle East strategy. She was set to attend a private, three-hour dinner held in his honor in July 2012. And there’s some evidence that the two have similar mindsets. While leading NATO, Stavridis would sign off some of his e-mails with the slogan ‘Stronger Together’ — which is now Clinton’s campaign slogan.” Bottom line: Floating Stavridis seems more like Grade-A trolling than a serious trial balloon: Trump has been talking about how much he likes ""the generals,"" and he was genuinely interested in Michael Flynn until his disastrous appearance Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" Clinton, who was on the Armed Services committee during her time in the Senate, has deeper relationships with way more brass than Trump, and this might be a way of showcasing that reality. Also, this guy ran NATO, which Trump actively antagonizes on the stump. Ultimately, HRC is a political animal and it's almost inconceivable to see her either going a non-political route or taking a risk on someone who has not been tested. -- In what was widely interpreted as a signal that Elizabeth Warren will not be picked as Clinton's running-mate, the Massachusetts senator was invited to speak during the first night of the Democratic convention. But, but, but: CNN's Jeff Zeleny says the convention schedule is still operating on a separate track from the veep vetting, and she could easily be swapped with someone else. (John Edwards was announced as an early convention speaker in 2004, but that changed after John Kerry tapped him.) -- Hillary will meet with Senate Democrats during their Thursday caucus lunch in the Capitol, just before members leave town for a long recess. They can already smell the jet fumes... -- “Cory Booker Gets Vetted, By Himself,” by BuzzFeed's Ruby Cramer: The 47-year-old has never fit the profile of a regular politician. ""He’s a Stanford football player who quoted poetry in his campus newspaper column; a black Baptist who led the Oxford Jewish club; a suburban-born Yale Law grad with a relentless passion for a city that didn’t always love him back. … He talks in big lofty language about the ‘arc of history’ and ‘conspiracy of love.’ But the loose, freewheeling style that helped form Booker’s political identity didn’t translate easily to his 2013 U.S. Senate race, when stories he’d been telling for years suddenly came under fire. [Staples of his stump speech were verifiably false or could not be corroborated.] ... The experience left him a little rattled, a little wary of a media environment where, he says, people try to ‘bring folk down.’ But it was that race, according to his aides, that helped push Booker to become more disciplined and measured. … Booker, determined to avoid the missteps of 2013, now goes by a new rule. ‘Every story I tell, I’m going to find second and third sources.'"" THE DAILY DONALD: -- Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has continued to lob attacks at Trump this week, calling him a “faker” and saying she is surprised the media has not pressed him harder to release his tax returns. (Robert Barnes) Trump responded by calling for her resignation and last night suggested that she is senile:  -- The editorial boards of The Post and the New York Times both chastise Ginsburg this morning. We cannot recall seeing ""Trump is right"" on the Times's editorial page so far this year, but the paper says the justice ""needs to drop the political punditry and the name-calling."" The Post's board -- independent from the news division -- is more gentle but nonetheless stern: ""However valid her comments may have been ... and however in keeping with her known political bent, they were still much, much better left unsaid by a member of the Supreme Court. ... Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts.""  -- Intel’s CEO canceled a planned meeting with Trump when his campaign tried to turn it into a fundraiser. Brian “Krzanich said he’d originally scheduled a gathering at his home to discuss issues important to Intel and himself with Trump,” Bloomberg’s Ian King reports. “It turned into a fundraiser, which is when we backed out,” he said. “It was supposed to be a conversation about issues.” The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. -- The Donald declined an invitation to speak at the NAACP convention in Cincinnati, skipping a prominent civil rights conference that both major party nominees typically address. ""The explanation given was that they're holding their convention at the same time,"" NAACP leader Cornell William Brooks said on CNN. ""We, of course, are in Cincinnati. They are in Cleveland. We were hoping he would make the short trip from Cleveland to Cincinnati."" (Jenna Johnson) -- Eric Trump said he cannot remember a single instance when his father donated “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in personal money to charity, after repeatedly making that claim in a series of interviews last week. ""I’m sure there have been but without going back through 10 years, I wouldn’t remember check for check off the top of my head,"" the candidate's son told David Fahrenthold – who has been doggedly pursuing the story – in an email. “As the day went on, Eric Trump was pressed to explain the contrast with his own statements from a few days before. Why had he asserted that his father had given his charity hundreds of thousands of dollars, if now he didn't remember it ever happening?” In response, Eric Trump said he was too busy to look for any evidence that would corroborate his claims: “I have a lot going on — I just don't have the time. Good luck with the story,” he wrote. “Those comments undermine what was — for a few days — the strongest testimonial about Donald Trump's recent giving to charity.” -- Clinton ally David Brock will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. to announce that an anonymous Republican has offered to contribute $5 MILLION to a veteran’s charity of Trump’s choosing if the presumptive GOP nominee releases his tax returns. Trump has given varying excuses for refusing to release his returns, as every major party nominee for a generation has done. -- New York Times, “For Whites Sensing Decline, Trump Unleashes Words of Resistance,” by Nicholas Confessore: “The resentment among whites feels both old and distinctly of this moment. It is shaped by the reality of demographic change, by a decade and a half of war in the Middle East, and by unease with the newly confident and confrontational activism of young blacks furious over police violence. It is mingled with patriotism, pride, fear and a sense that an America without them at its center is not really America anymore. … In a country where the wealthiest and most influential citizens are still mostly white, Mr. Trump is voicing the bewilderment and anger of whites who do not feel at all powerful or privileged. But in doing so, Mr. Trump has also opened the door to assertions of white identity and resentment in a way not seen so broadly in American culture in over half a century. … Dozens of interviews … suggest that the passions aroused and channeled by Mr. Trump take many forms, from earnest if muddled rebellion to deeper and more elaborate bigotry.” -- David Duke is considering launching a congressional bid against Steve Scalise in Louisiana: The former KKK grand wizard said he has set up an exploratory committee and is “heavily leaning” towards challenging the House Majority Whip. He said he will make a final decision in the next few days. (Daily Beast) -- A Trump University course advised students on how they could profit by targeting destitute, “completely disabled” homeowners in pre-foreclosure. From Mother Jones’ Patrick Caldwell: ""The 2006 course, which Trump vowed would offer a 'real estate gold mine,' features tips from real estate investment adviser Gary Eldred about how to best exploit homeowners facing foreclosures. The goal, Eldred says, is to find homeowners who are in a truly desperate financial position. ‘Under no circumstance will a lender accept a short sale if they think they can squeeze that borrower for an extra nickel,’ he explains. He lists the conditions that are ideal for a short sale: ‘The borrower is out of work, the borrower has $50,000 in unpaid medical claims, the borrow is completely disabled, the borrower has an extraordinarily messy divorce where everything has been squandered.’” Trump echoed these sentiments in a taped introduction for the course: “I’m sorry for them, but life goes on,” he said of desperate property owners. “And the fact is, one person's misfortune is someone else's opportunity.” THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION STARTS IN FIVE DAYS: -- “GOP moves closer to the base, and away from the broader public, in party platform,"" by Ed O'Keefe and Dan Balz: The Republican Party firmly embraced conservative orthodoxy on abortion, gay rights, gun rights and immigration during its platform committee meetings in Cleveland. “Among the specific policies the platform committee endorsed is a ‘border wall’ that would cover ‘the entirety of the Southern Border.' ... On abortion, the committee added the full text of the Hyde Amendment — which bans the use of federal funding for all forms of the procedure — to the platform. The panel also included support for ‘religious freedom’ laws and made changes to reinforce its support for traditional marriage.""  The victory of the RNC hardliners comes as public opinion continues to inch away from them, especially on social issues: “Approval of legal abortion jumped from 51 percent to 58 percent in 2015. … A record-high six in 10 Americans support same-sex marriage [and] a CNN/ORC poll released in May found that a majority of Americans don’t agree with so-called bathroom bills.  … Regardless, few members of the platform committee spoke in opposition to any of the proposals.” -- The New Black Panther Party announced that its members will carry guns for self-defense during rallies outside the RNC next week: ""If it is an open state to carry, we will exercise our second amendment rights because there are other groups threatening to be there that are threatening to do harm to us,"" said Panthers leader Hashim Nzinga. Ohio officials have said it will be legal for protesters to carry weapons in accordance with the state’s open carry laws, so long as protesters remain outside the convention perimeter. (Reuters) -- Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy said Cleveland police are “ready,” officially deeming the city police force well-equipped to handle any potential fracas. (Plain Dealer) -- Rudy Giuliani is expected to speak at the GOP convention and could earn a prime opening-night time slot, according to Politico. The former New York City mayor’s rumored speech comes in the wake of his inflammatory comments about Black Lives Matter activists Sunday, but party leaders are struggling to book big names for Trump’s coronation. -- Mitch McConnell said he plans to speak. -- Ryan, who will chair the convention, repeatedly defended his endorsement of Trump during a CNN town hall last night. ""It is a binary choice,"" the Speaker said. ""It is either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. You don't get a third option."" -- Ted Cruz will travel to Cleveland this Friday to address a closed-door meeting of movement conservative leaders ahead of the convention. “Cruz will speak to a gathering of the Council for National Policy, a secretive group … many of whom backed the Texas senator in his failed presidential bid,” per Politico’s Shane Goldmacher. “The CNP is a nonprofit, but some of its members, including Tony Perkins, who also serves as head of the Family Research Council, are part of a subgroup that had voted to endorse Cruz in hopes of uniting the movement behind a single candidate in 2016 … The closed-door speech also represents a chance for Cruz to stay in the good graces of [activists] who could power a 2020 presidential run.” The RNC rules committee also meets Friday. This is where Stop Trump Republicans are expected to make their last-ditch effort to block him from the nomination. (Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier says Cruz plans to appear only at the CNP gathering, not at any RNC meetings.) -- The governor of Texas confirmed he will stay home. Greg Abbott, who suffered severe burns while vacationing in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last week, is in the hospital recovering from a skin graft procedure. (Austin American-Statesman) -- BuzzFeed is hosting a party for reporters from the dozen media organizations that have been blacklisted from being credentialed to cover Trump events. (Huffington Post's Michael Calderone) THE DEMOCRATIC DENOUEMENT: -- Sanders pledged to support Clinton during a “boisterous, but at times awkward rally” in New Hampshire. ""She will be the Democratic nominee for president, and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States,"" the senator from Vermont said. Speaking directly to Sanders’s supporters, Clinton welcomed them to her campaign and encouraged them to “make it your own.” “You will always have a seat at the table when I am in the White House,” she said. Clinton and Sanders took the stage to a Bruce Springsteen anthem that was standard at his rallies, John Wagner flags. -- Wasting no time, Sanders is preparing to launch “as many as three” organizations to continue the efforts of his campaign. “One will be devoted to policy formulation. A second will focus on recruiting and training candidates. And a third might engage in other political activity, possibly registering as a political action committee,"" Wagner reports. Campaign manager Jeff Weaver said he expects the organizations “to be up and running in a matter of weeks, with the aim of fully participating in the fall elections.” -- “DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz seems safe until November,” by CNN’s Manu Raju: There were discussions about replacing her, including with Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin. ""But those talks didn't pick up much steam, sources said, with Clinton showing little appetite to boot Wasserman Schultz and cause a distraction, while Sanders focused his energy instead on influencing the party platform. When Clinton took over the DNC last month, the campaign named Brandon Davis, a former national political director for the Services Employees International Union, as the chief of staff, giving him day-to-day control over the operation and effectively limiting the role of the Florida Democrat. Now ... there seems to be little appetite for a drawn-out committee fight over naming a replacement."" -- “Democrats make education revisions to 2016 platform — and a key reformer is furious,” by Valerie Strauss: “In an unexpected move, Democrats revised the K-12 education section of their party’s 2016 platform in important ways, backing the right of parents to opt their children out of high-stakes standardized tests, qualifying support for charter schools, and opposing using test scores for high-stakes purposes to evaluate teachers and students. Some of the changes are being welcomed by public school advocates who have been fighting corporate school reform, which includes standardized test-based accountability systems and the expansion of charter schools. Many of these activists have been worried that Clinton … would back corporate reform, just as the Obama administration has. While it isn’t clear exactly what she will do if she becomes president — as platform language does not necessarily translate into policy — supporters of those reforms are furious at the changes, highlighting a rift in the party over how to improve K-12 education.” WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: -- “Inside ISIS: Quietly preparing for the loss of the ‘caliphate’,” by Joby Warrick and Souad Mekhennet: “Even as it launches waves of terrorist attacks around the globe, the Islamic State is quietly preparing its followers for the eventual collapse of the caliphate it proclaimed with great fanfare two years ago. In public messages and in recent actions in Syria, the group’s leaders are acknowledging the terrorist organization’s declining fortunes on the battlefield while bracing for the possibility that its remaining strongholds could fall. U.S. counterterrorism experts believe the mass ­casualty attacks in Istanbul and Baghdad in the past month were largely a response to military reversals in Iraq and Syria. Such terrorist acts are likely to continue and even intensify … as the group evolves from a quasi-state with territorial holdings to a shadowy and diffuse network with branches and cells on at least three continents.” Alarming quote, from an Islamic State operative: “We do have, every day, people reaching out and telling us they want to come to the caliphate. But we tell them to stay in their countries and rather wait to do something there.” -- “Cash-strapped Rio state says Olympics will be fine. But what about afterward?,” by Dom Phillips: “The state of Rio is so broke it is selling off the governor’s summer residence and the small island it sits on. But because of a recent federal government bailout, officials insist, the Summer Olympics will go just fine. The problem is what happens after the Games. … Rio is running a deficit of about $6 billion a year ... and has lurched from one crisis to another since last year, when state hospitals ran out of basic supplies. Now, officials say, everything is in place for Rio to stage a memorable Olympics — although many observers doubt even that. Less than a month before the Games begin, some emergency health centers have reduced their hours and are struggling to pay suppliers. Police and firefighters have twice staged demonstrations at Rio’s international airport, warning that visitors’ safety cannot be guaranteed and protesting still-unpaid salaries. 'This was for us to work during the Olympics, to shut us up,' said one officer. 'We don’t know what will happen afterward.'"" -- “Colombia offers the possibility that the Zika epidemic may not be as bad as feared,” by Nick Miroff: “In the nine months since the Zika virus appeared in Colombia, the government has reported nearly 100,000 cases, including more than 17,000 pregnant women. But the epidemic has not produced the dreaded wave of fetal deformities witnessed in Brazil. Brazilian health officials blame the virus for at least 1,600 cases of the birth defect microcephaly, and they are investigating another 3,000 for a link to Zika. In Colombia, the country that has logged the second-highest number of infections, authorities have linked Zika to 18 cases of microcephaly, with 112 under investigation.The fact that Colombia has seen a relatively modest — not massive — increase in birth defects raises some hopes that the threat of microcephaly from Zika is not as high"" as previously expected.

1,"OF THE THOUSANDS of artists I have interviewed over the years, few have been as demonstrably brave as Atena Farghadani. Atena was already an experienced activist in her 20s when she drew a cartoon mocking Iran’s parliament to protest her native nation’s anti-birth control policies. She was arrested by the Revolutionary Guard in the summer of 2014 — her freedom taken from her. When Atena was kept jailed for most of the rest of that year, she still would not be refused her art, as she flattened the disposable cups in her cell as makeshift canvas — until her materials were taken from her. Early in 2015, a freed Atena spoke out about prisoner conditions, and was arrested again. By June, the 29-year-old woman was sentenced to nearly 13 years in prison — her immediate hope for even a shred of justice taken from her. [Iranian artist Farghadani, who drew parliament as animals, sentenced to 12-plus years] Soon, Atena shook hands with her male attorney, Mohammad Moghimi, who was likewise jailed for a time as a result. In response, Atena’s captors subjected her to a virginity test — apparently in an unsuccessful attempt to take her dignity, too. [Open Call to Artists: #Draw4Atena to support appeal of Iranian artist’s sentence] Two months ago, Atena was finally freed. Today, Atena vows to continue to make political art from within Iran, where her voice may have the greatest effect. This is an exclusive Q&A with Ms. Farghadani, in her first interview with the Western press since winning her release. The interview was conducted via email through Nikahang Kowsar, the Iranian-born board member of the Washington-based Cartoonists Rights Network International, who himself was jailed in Iran in 2000 for his art. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.  MICHAEL CAVNA: First off, Ms. Farghadani, let me just say, now that the opportunity finally provides: Congratulations on your freedom. We heard reports about the difficult conditions while you were imprisoned. How are you feeling, and doing? And how does one even recover from a mental and physical ordeal such as yours? ATENA FARGHADANI: I appreciate all the efforts you and your colleagues have made so far. My feelings at the moment are not very pleasant, because it’s like I’m stuck in a limbo. Obviously, the mental weariness of imprisonment is more serious than the physical problems caused by it. At the moment, since I’ve arrived at the certainty that there is miracle lying in the art of drawing and painting, I’m more determined to continue doing it than ever. MC: You, of course, have become an inspiration to so many around the world, Atena — a beacon of creative and political resistance. While you were in prison — Evin and elsewhere — how aware were of you of the degree to which the outside world knew and was following your story? Was Mr. Moghimi able to provide you with news in that regard during your case? AF: When I was in prison, I wasn’t aware of outside events and the news about me, especially in 2015, when I was on a hunger strike in the gruesome Gharchak prison. At that point, I was absolutely hopeless and thought I would die there, without my voice ever being heard. But I kept going with the strike, constantly thinking that even if I die, I have a clear conscience for I’ve died for my beliefs and goals. After my appeal to be transferred to Evin prison was approved and I ended my hunger strike, my attorney, Mr. Moghimi, gave me all news in two very short visits, boosting my morale and giving me hope. MC: For my Washington Post colleague Jason Rezaian, one aspect of the ordeal of being in an Iranian prison was not knowing one’s fate — feeling as though you are in the legal hands of a system that might not practice justice as you, the prisoner, might understand it, and all the uncertainty. Could you talk about what was hardest for you about your long detentions and imprisonment — and whether you thought you might actually spend more than 13 years behind bars for your outspokenness and artwork? AF: When I heard my sentence of 12 years and nine months’ imprisonment, I thought it was unbelievable and very unjust. Since I was 29 at the time, I calculated that I’d have to be in prison till I’m 42. At first, I had a hard time accepting the sentence, but then I thought I could use this time, as much as possible, to draw and have an opportunity to put an exhibition of my works after my release. I considered prison my home for the next 13 years. My family could not accept this new attitude of mine towards prison and my beliefs and at times they were frightened by it and wept. At these times, I had no choice but to make faces for them from behind the glasses in the visitation cabin to make them laugh. These were the hardest and most bitter days I had during my incarceration. MC: Why do you think you were ultimately awarded your freedom? What swayed the legal system? AF: As the results of the efforts made by my family and my attorney, Mr. Moghimi, and pressures from the international community and human rights organizations, my sentence was reduced from 12 years and nine months to 18 months and a three-year suspended sentence for insulting the supreme leader of Iran. I am grateful to all those whom I don’t know and to whom I owe my freedom. MC: Is there anything about your case [including the reported “virginity test"" after shaking your male attorney’s hand] that we should know about that we might not know? AF: Yes, that’s … caused lots of confusion: Considering the fact that my family had refuted that I was tested for virginity and pregnancy because of shaking hands with my lawyer, people wanted to know the truth. The truth is that my family was in denial at the time because of the dominant traditions and the Iranian culture and fear for more pressure from the judiciary on me. But the tests were actually made, which led to my three-day dry hunger strike in objection. The Islamic Republic of Iran later confirmed this event. It is noteworthy that both my attorney and I were exonerated from the adultery accusations and I owe this to the judge of this specific case, who issued our exoneration verdict independently and neutrally in spite of the sensitivity of the case and security pressures. MC: What art are you making now — and will your art remain political, or might you steer your art and activism in a different direction? AF: Right now, I’m painting and making a collection of artwork with political and social contents, and I intend to have an exhibition within a year, but I’m afraid I can’t hold this exhibition in Iran, and thus I’m even thinking of having a street gallery, though it wouldn’t be without consequences. I believe that “criticism” serves art. So, I have decided to use my art to challenge social issues as I have done before, like the cartoon I drew after I was released as an objection to the dean of Al-Zahra University, who expelled me and many other students. MC: Do you feel safe now in Iran, and can you see ever coming to visit America? AF: Of course, I could be more successful in developed countries, but when I witness the problems Iranians are dealing with, such as economic and cultural poverty and various limitations, I cannot leave them alone to live in another country in a better situation, despite all the constraints and issues I would possibly face. Many Iranians, though, have had to leave their homeland because of these constraints and have been active outside their country to improve human rights in Iran and are successful, too. But I don’t see it in me to be able to leave my country because of my emotional attachments, which is perhaps a weakness of mine, but as long as I live, I will stay here, even if I have to go to prison again. MC: Are you comfortable with being a symbol for artistic resistance and political freedom of expression? AF: I don’t consider myself a symbol. I simply acted on my thought, beliefs and principles, and I think all people have an individual and social task to fulfill. MC: Is there something I didn’t ask that you would especially like to tell readers? AF: Yes, one of the things that has had [a] destructive impact on me after my release was the incarceration in the gruesome Gharchak prison, which is for prisoners with all sorts of non-security crimes. What bothered me the most was to see inmates — many of whom were victims of the economic and cultural poverty in the Iranian system — who were not treated like human beings; their most basic rights were violated. I consider Gharchak prison as a graveyard of time … where time dies. I sometimes see those inmates in my nightmares. Once, I saw one of them collecting and braiding my fallen hair! I see myself as a reflection of other people, and to respond to this question of yours, I would like to reflect the wishes of other women imprisoned in Gharchak — most of them longed for cool drinking water, instead of the salty lukewarm water they had to drink from the tap. There were only four showers in each chamber for 189 inmates, with the same salty water for only an hour a day, so many of them missed a hot shower! Many of them [condemned to] death sentences wished to plant something that wouldn’t wither from the salty water and [to] see that plant — to leave a living mark before departing from this life.

0,"Tuesday night, just as I was about to watch Bill Clinton’s speech, Reason editor Matt Welch asked me something over Twitter: This is a more difficult exercise than you would think for a number of reasons. One can certainly evaluate the foreign policy record of each secretary of state while in office. The problem is that this record is not only, or even primarily, a function of the secretary of state. That would be like seeing Mike Trout strike out against Aroldis Chapman and concluding that Trout was no good. In considering foreign policy, the external environment matters a lot. So does the degree of interest and control that a president exercises over American foreign policy. To use an example, James Baker is widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest secretaries of state of all time. His diplomacy helped ensure a peaceful end to the Cold War and a unified, multilateral coalition for the first Gulf War. But Baker had the wind at his back: a fading Soviet Union and a president who was keenly interested and engaged in international relations. Baker deserves credit, but not all the credit, if you know what I mean. So, with that in mind, here’s my ranking, from worst to first, of the six post-Cold War secretaries of state. I will preface this by saying that Baker towers over this lot, but I’m not including him in the post-Cold War set. Indeed, the Cold War secretaries of state (George C. Marshall, Dean Acheson, John Foster Dulles, Dean Rusk and George P. Shultz) are on average of a much higher caliber than the ones discussed below. 6) Warren Christopher. The “Cars 2” of the post-1992 secretaries of state, “Chris” got a bad beat. His president did not care a flying fig about foreign policy for at least the first two years of his presidency, and Christopher felt constrained by that fact. Nonetheless, Christopher’s preternatural caution generally let bad situations (Somalia, Bosnia) deteriorate on his watch. There isn’t a single account of the Bill Clinton administration’s foreign policy record in which Christopher comes out looking good — and that includes his own memoirs. Given the favorable geopolitical situation the United States inherited when he took office, it’s a lackluster performance. 5) Colin Powell. Powell was badly hamstrung by the lack of trust between him and President George W. Bush. Bush overruled Powell on diplomacy with North Korea in March 2001, and things went downhill from there. Powell’s constant bureaucratic battles with Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld proved problematic for his tenure, as it kept him in Washington when he needed to try to make America’s case to allies and partners. The biggest mistakes of Bush’s first term were not Powell’s, but he failed to stop most of these catastrophes, and his performance did little to compensate for them. 4) John Kerry. This ranking is probably unfair — he still has six months left, and history will offer a better perspective. Kerry gets major points for the Iran deal, a significant feat of diplomacy that was more him than President Obama. The Paris climate change agreement is also significant. The problem comes with trying to list things after that. It is to Kerry’s credit that he has invested in tough tasks, like Iran or an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. It is to Kerry’s debit that some of those investments did not pay off. The opportunity cost of them is Kerry looking flat-footed and underinvested in other trouble-spots, such as Eastern Europe. 3) Madeleine Albright. The first female secretary of state, Albright benefited greatly from a president who was more comfortable and more engaged in international relations than he was in his first term. But Albright was also willing to take more risks than Christopher, a trait that paid off in the case of Kosovo. The biggest criticism of Albright would be her absence from the most significant foreign policy crisis of Clinton’s second term — the Asian financial crisis. 2) Condoleezza Rice. Well, this will be the second-most controversial ranking. Rice’s disastrous tenure as national security adviser will color most people’s perceptions of her time at Foggy Bottom. The parlous state of American foreign affairs in January 2009 will also lead many to pooh-pooh Rice’s performance as secretary of state. But it requires some willful amnesia to forget the situation that Rice inherited when she took the job, and the skillful ways in which she was able to outmaneuver Rumsfeld and Cheney. Her close relationship with the president allowed Rice to pivot American foreign policy away from the excesses of Bush’s first term to something akin to competency in her second term. It was a thankless task, and Rice’s legacy will always be tarnished by her NSC stint. Nevertheless, she did a good job in a tough time. 1) Hillary Clinton. Here’s the dirty little secret of trying to evaluate Clinton’s record as secretary of state: The Obama White House centralized foreign policy control almost as much as Richard Nixon. Which means that it’s tough to credit or blame Clinton for what happened during her four years in office. Nonetheless, she played a significant role in restoring America’s standing abroad. She was nimble in handling some thorny diplomatic kerfuffles with China (Google “Wang Lijun” or “Chen Guangcheng” to see what I mean). She helped put together formidable economic sanctions against Iran. Even on Libya, Clinton deserves credit for her ability to get NATO, the Arab League and the U.N. Security Council to endorse action; the post-Libya fiasco has less to do with Clinton and more to do with her boss. And one can argue that the Paris climate change accord only happened because of Clinton and Obama’s actions in Copenhagen. In a decade, this ranking might change, particularly for Kerry. And ranking Clinton as the best of the lot means saying that she was the best of a mediocre group, all of whom would fall below the Cold War list of names mentioned above. But it is interesting to note that the ladies on this list outperformed the men.","Tuesday night, just as I was about to watch Bill Clinton’s speech, Reason editor Matt Welch asked me something over Twitter: This is a more difficult exercise than you would think for a number of reasons.

0,"THE BIG IDEA: By David Weigel, filling in for James, who is on vacation. A specter is haunting the Green Party – the specter of Ralph Nader. This morning, as America’s fourth-largest party gathers in Houston to nominate a presidential ticket, it’s struggling to capture the progressive voters who supported Bernie Sanders. Jill Stein, the party’s likely nominee, was rebuffed when she asked Sanders to join the party, and rebuffed again when she asked popular Sanders surrogate Nina Turner to be her running mate. Why is progressive frustration with Hillary Clinton not boosting the Greens? It’s because sixteen years ago, Green Party nominee Ralph Nader won 2.9 million votes, and at least 2 million of those voters came to blame themselves for the victory of George W. Bush over Al Gore. (The combined vote for Nader and Green candidates since 2000 has never exceeded 900,000.) The 2000 election was one of the founding traumas of the modern center-left. It’s no accident that Stein polls best with voters under 30; liberal voters who remember 2000 are likely to associate “voting your conscience” with giving away the presidency. That’s most evident in the list of Nader supporters from 2000 who have never come back to the Green Party. Nader's running mate that year, Winona LaDuke, endorsed John Kerry in 2004 and then disengaged from politics. Michael Moore, who introduced Nader at some of his rallies, later apologized to Al Gore and has endorsed Democrats for president ever since. Many of the celebrities, academics and intellectuals who backed Nader went on to support Sanders; the only prominent one to support Stein this time is Cornel West. “There were three claims made by Nader in 2000,” said Charles Lenchner, who voted for Nader that year but went on to found the grassroots group People for Bernie. “The first was that there was no substantial difference between Al Gore and George W. Bush. The second was that the campaign would be a boost to local organizing. The third was that the Green Party could emerge as a viable force in our politics. And none of that came to pass.” Nader’s 2000 campaign combined a man and a moment in a way that exhilarated the post-millennium left. Bill Clinton’s presidency was deeply unsatisfying to anti-war and anti-globalist progressives. George W. Bush’s campaign sold itself as a “compassionate” center-right successor to Clinton; for much of 2000, it polled so far ahead of Al Gore’s campaign that a protest vote seemed harmless. And Nader himself was a consumer rights icon whose celebrity transcended right or left. “Ralph Nader was an icon, and he still is an icon,” said Rosa DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, who was running that union’s precursor when it endorsed Nader in 2000. “When you supported him, you were supporting decades of advocacy that you could be proud of.” Stein, by contrast, entered national politics after some success as an environmental activist and Green candidate in Massachusetts. She has never had a following outside of the party, hence her yeoman efforts last week to convince Sanders supporters that they could transfer their hopes into her campaign. But the Bush years and the Trump campaign have prevented the sort of “Tweedledum or Tweedledum” critique of the two parties that made Nader possible. Gore had voted to confirm Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court; Clinton pledges to appoint a liberal justice, and a seat is open. Even Stein struggles to suggest that a Trump presidency would pose the same challenges as a Clinton presidency. The argument for a Green vote this time is more of a bank shot – that four years of total opposition will strengthen the left, or that a Clinton presidency will eventually empower Republicans. “The first term of a Kerry-Edwards administration and a Republican Congress would have implemented precisely the same policies as did the second term of Bush-Cheney in regard to Iraq, the housing market, etc,” said Andrew Bonnell, a professor at Ball State University who signed a 2000 letter of support from academics for Nader. “The landslide that would have swept Mitt Romney or John McCain or whoever into the White House in the aftermath of that presidency might well have made the Republicans unchallengeable at every level of politics for a generation. This time is like that.” That’s more complicated than the argument Nader made in 2000 – that it simply did not matter whether “Gush or Bore” took the White House. Nader, who at age 82 is done with electoral politics, was wry about Stein’s appeal, and skeptical that a third party vote would hold up by election day. After all, his record-high Green Party vote was far short of what polling predicted. “What I’d say to a ‘Bernie or Bust’ person is: Vote for the Green Party agenda and Jill Stein, because it’s the closest agenda to Bernie’s,” said Nader. “But if you called up the head of the DNC, and you said ‘Jill Stein is up to 5 or 8 percent,’ they’d say ‘Relax, she’ll go back to 1 percent.’ That’s what happens to voters on the left. They all get back in the fold the day before the election. They get cold feet.” Nader did not say who he would support (“not Hillary or Trump, as you might guess”), and suggested that voters worrying about a close election in August were getting ahead of themselves. “Let’s see where we are in October,” said Nader, speculating that Trump could collapse in the polls. If Trump did not collapse, even Ralph Nader was willing to understand voters who considered Clinton a “lesser evil,” but were scared of the consequences if they voted for a third party – and Trump won. “If you’re in a deep red or deep blue state, you can vote your conscience,” said Nader. “In the swing states, if you don’t vote your conscience, and you want to vote for Hillary, you have a moral obligation to organize the second she gets elected.”

 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: POST-CONVENTIONS POLLS BEGIN TO SHOW CLINTON OPENING UP SIGNIFICANT LEAD Clinton now has a 10-POINT lead over Trump in a new Fox News poll, which surveys voters nationally, and she tops Trump by DOUBLE DIGITS in key swing states like New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Cautionary note: these are the first batch of post-convention surveys and we'll have to keep watching closely to see whether this is a real trend or a reaction to Trump's erratic recent moves, such as attacking the family of a Muslim-American war hero and refusing to back House Speaker Paul Ryan's reelection. -- Clinton bested Trump, 49 to 39 percent in the Fox News poll, which was taken post-convention from July 31 to Aug. 2. The former secretary of state earned a five-point spike from the last survey, gaining among men, women, whites, young voters and seniors.  Key takeaway: Trump is falling way short of Mitt Romney's 2012 numbers: Trump is winning white voters by 10 points compared to 20 for Mitt; Trump is winning men by 5 points compared to 7 points for Romney; he takes white evangelicals by 50 points to 57 for Romney; and wins whites without a college degree by 16 points compared to 26 for Romney. -- In NEW HAMPSHIRE, a key swing state, voters also strongly favor Clinton, per a WBUR survey: Clinton holds a 15-point lead over Trump in the Granite State, up 47 percent to his 32 percent. (Eight percent of voters preferred Libertarian Gary Johnson.) -- Clinton also jumped to a big lead in MICHIGAN: she tops Trump 41 to 32 percent in the state, per a fresh Detroit News poll. The Democrat's lead was just four points in May. Clinton also gained a “shocking” lead in Republican strongholds of west and southwest Michigan – up by five and six points, respectively, in each region.   --In PENNSYLVANIA, which Trump boasts he can win and is key to his hopes, Clinton jumped to a 13-point lead, according to a Franklin & Marshall College poll in the state. Meanwhile, Democratic nominee Katie McGinty also leads Republican Pat Toomey in the Senate race, up 38 to his 30 percent. FALLOUT? -- A new GOP campaign ad promises to “stand up” to Trump. From Politico’s Alex Isenstadt: “The commercial, from GOP Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado, represents the first time a House Republican has used explicitly anti-Trump messaging in paid advertising. It comes as many in the Republican Party — concerned about Trump’s impact on down-ballot races — are grappling with whether to take further measures to repudiate their presidential nominee after a string of controversies including an attack on a Gold Star family and his refusal to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan in his primary.” Watch it here. We may be seeing a slew of other ads like it if Trump's numbers continue to fall: GET SMART FAST:​​ BAD TIMING? DEBATE OVER PAYOUT TO IRAN RAGES: -- The Wall Street Journal reports that senior Justice Department officials objected to sending a U.S. cash payment to Iran that coincided with the release of four U.S. prisoners, but objections were allegedly “overruled by the State Department.” More on the story: “The timing and manner of the payment raised alarms at the Justice Department ... Justice Department officials didn’t object to the $1.7 billion settlement, which they viewed as a bargain given decades of inflation and the circumstances of the original deal … But their concerns show that even within the Obama administration there were worries that the pallets of cash could send the wrong signal to Iran—and potentially to others—about U.S. policy when it came to hostages. Prosecutors were concerned that the U.S. would release too many Iranian convicts and drop too many pending criminal cases against people suspected of violating sanctions laws. They prevailed regarding some of the suspects—those accused or suspected of crimes of terrorism or other violence—but the objections on others were overruled, according to the people familiar with the discussions. “[Paul Ryan] was among those who seized on the timing and cloak-and-dagger delivery method,” Carol Morello writes, “saying it proved suspicions that the Obama administration had tried to hide a payment for the four Americans … “In fact, the money was earmarked to settle a decades-old Iranian claim on the money, plus $1.3 billion in interest. The funds were deposited by Iran before the 1979 revolution to buy U.S. military equipment, and they were frozen under President Jimmy Carter after Americans were taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Iran has been trying to recover the money ever since, at one point contending that it was owed $10 billion or more with accrued interest. …” -- HOW IT'S PLAYING ON THE TRAIL: Trump falsely claimed he watched footage of the controversial money transfer, telling voters at a Daytona Beach rally that he laid eyes on a months-old video “recorded by the Iranian government and released to embarrass the United States.” From Jenna Johnson:  ""Remember this: Iran — I don't think you heard this anywhere but here — Iran provided all of that footage, the tape of taking that money off the airplane,"" Trump said at the rally. ""Right?"" “Trump provided no source for this exclusive information but described in detail what he saw in the video[:] ‘And they have a perfect tape, done by obviously a government camera, and the tape is of the people taking the money off the plane,” [he said]. ‘Right? That means that in order to embarrass us further, Iran sent us the tapes. …’” What he was likely watching? Dark, grainy and widely-shared footage of the U.S. prisoners apparently landing in Geneva: After his remarks, The Post asked Trump’s spokespeople to clarify what Trump was talking about, emailing a link to a Fox News clip that showed the January footage from Geneva and asking if that was the video the nominee saw. “‘Yes,’ spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded in an email. ‘Merely the b-roll footage included in every broadcast.’ Hicks has yet to respond to a follow-up email asking why Trump thought the footage showed a money transfer and not the … hostage swap, and why Trump said it was recorded by the Iranian government.” Watch Trump tell attendees about the ""secret"" video: He also tweeted about the situation: Some conservatives defended Trump on this one: THE DAILY DONALD: -- “Turmoil in the Republican Party escalated Wednesday as party leaders, strategists and donors voiced increased alarm about the flailing state of Trump’s candidacy and fears that the presidential nominee was damaging the party with an extraordinary week of self-inflicted mistakes, gratuitous attacks and missed opportunities.” From Philip Rucker, Dan Balz and Matea Gold: “RNC Chairman Reince Priebus was described as ‘very frustrated’ with and deeply disturbed by Trump’s behavior over the past week, having run out of excuses to make on the nominee’s behalf to donors and other party leaders … Meanwhile, Trump’s top campaign advisers are struggling once again to instill discipline in their candidate, who has spent recent days lurching from one controversy to another while seemingly skipping chances to go on the offensive against … [Clinton].” -- Top Trump allies publicly urged him to reboot, “furious” at the Republican nominee for both his continued feuding with the parents of dead Army Capt. Humayun Khan, as well as his refusal to endorse Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain in their respective primary elections.  Amid the controversy, Trump suffered two more Republican defections: “Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), an Iraq War veteran, said on CNN that he is unlikely to vote for Trump because the nominee was ‘beginning to cross a lot of red lines of the unforgivable in politics.’” And former Montana governor and RNC chairman Marc Racicot said he will not vote for Trump. “I’m not accusing people of being appeasers, but what I am saying is that there’s a transcendent set of values throughout our history that we subscribe to above party,” Racicot said in an interview, adding that he “thinks Trump lacks those values.” (Check out the full list of Republicans who have vowed not to vote for Trump here.) “People are more frustrated than they have been with past indiscretions,’ said Steve Duprey, a New Hampshire RNC member and confidant of both McCain and Sen. Kelly Ayotte. “People are just going, ‘Can you believe this?’ … Our nominee is losing opportunities to make the case why he should be elected instead of Mrs. Clinton and instead spending all of his time dealing with controversies of his own creation,'"" Phil, Dan and Matea report. “Calling Priebus ‘very frustrated,’ a knowledgeable GOP strategist said, ‘It’s the totality of the week. The whole Khan thing kicking off the week was a concern to him, and then obviously all the other smaller issues were. The [failure to endorse Ryan and McCain] was like the cherry on the cake.’” “[Trump] seems to understand that if you produce a steady stream of sufficiently stupefying statements, there will be no time to dwell on any one of them, and the net effect on the public will be numbness and ennui,” George Will writes in his latest column. “The nation, however, is not immune to the lasting damage that is being done to it by Trump’s success in normalizing post-factual politics. It is being poisoned by the injection into its bloodstream of the cynicism required of those Republicans who persist in pretending that although Trump lies constantly and knows nothing, these blemishes do not disqualify him from being president. It has been well said that ‘sooner or later, we all sit down to a banquet of consequences.’ The Republican Party’s multicourse banquet has begun.” -- Meanwhile, Trump tried to strike a different tone while campaigning in Florida, insisting his campaign is “doing incredibly well” and staffers are working harmoniously. From Susan Cooper Eastman and Jenna Johnson: “’So, I just want to tell you the campaign is doing really well. It's never been so well united. I would say right now it's the best in terms of being united that it's been since we began. We're doing incredibly well,’ Trump said, pointing to polls that show him tied or slightly ahead of Clinton in the battleground states of Florida and Ohio. ‘So I think we've never been this united.’” He struck an upbeat note during the rally, focusing his ire Clinton and the Obama administration, Eastman and Johnson write. He said the U.S. has become “like a third-world nation,” accused Clinton of being ""the founder of ISIS"" and of creating the ""mess"" in Libya, and said he expects to win over Sanders supporters in November. ""Wouldn't that be embarrassing?"" Trump pondered. ""To lose to Crooked Hillary Clinton? That would be terrible."" “Trump also warned that crowd that Clinton might appoint Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to the U.S. Supreme Court — and in doing so, repeatedly referred to Warren as ‘Pocahontas’ because of the controversy over Warren previously claiming to have Native American heritage. ‘If Hillary puts her people on the Supreme Court — okay? — like, who knows,’ Trump said. ‘Elizabeth Warren maybe will go. Maybe. Pocahontas, Pocahontas. They'll put Pocahontas. What an insult to Pocahontas, isn't it? I apologize, ladies and gentlemen, to Pocahontas. But she will put people so far left that our country will become Venezuela.’” He also promised that once he becomes president, police officers will “no longer be shot on the job,” referencing the recent murders of on-duty police officers in Dallas and Louisiana. ""We're going to make our country safe again, and we're going to make our country great again,"" Trump said during a Wednesday night rally. “And we're going to have law and order, and we're going to respect our police, because you have to respect our police. We're not shooting our police. It's never been so dangerous to be a policeman or woman. It's never been so dangerous."" (Jenna Johnson) -- Trump’s campaign is also expanding their media presence as they seek to stop the bleeding and drive home a consistent message. Politico reports the team is bringing in veteran ad man Larry Weitzner, who has worked with both Chris Christie and former New York Gov. George Pataki, to help with the efforts. -- They also released fundraising numbers: Matea Gold reports Trump’s campaign raised $82 million in conjunction with the RNC during the month of July. Per the FEC filings: “…  64 million came in the form of donations contributed online and through direct mail solicitations ... Another $16 million was raised through 20 pricey fundraising events held in conjunction with the RNC. In addition, Trump personally contributed $2 million to his campaign, for a total monthly haul of $82 million.” Clinton, for comparison, pulled in $90 million alongside the DNC last month. -- Trump’s campaign will begin its outreach to African Americans this weekend. Buzzfeed’s Darren Sands and John Stanton outline the upcoming mobilization campaign:  “On Sunday, an entire Charlotte church will endorse Trump. Trump surrogates will attempt a media blitz, trying to engage black women, veterans, and leaders over the next several days, culminating in the church’s endorsement at Antioch Road to Glory International Ministries. ‘Supporting Hillary is like being with an abusive ex, one that you already know left you broken and wounded,’ reads a post on the church’s Facebook page from last month. ‘At this point, give the new guy a chance.’ The event there — ‘A Day of Endorsement’ — will feature a small group of high-profile Trump supporters: black outreach director Omarosa Manigault (an ordained minister); Trump national spokesperson Katrina Pierson; Trump surrogate Pastor Mark Burns … and Eric Trump Foundation VP Lynne Patton. And that’s how Donald Trump’s black outreach campaign will officially begin.” -- DISPATCHES FROM THE TRAIL: The New York Times spent several weeks documenting the angry and provocative comments at Trump rallies. “… What struck us was the frequency with which some Trump supporters use coarse, vitriolic, even violent language — in the epithets they shout and chant, the signs they carry, the T-shirts they wear — a pattern not seen in connection with any other recent political candidate, in any party,” they wrote. Check out their video here. THE DAILY HRC: -- New York Times, “Hillary Clinton Campaign Takes First Steps in Presidential Transition,” from Amy Chozick and Julie Hirschfeld Davis: “With her party’s convention behind her, Hillary Clinton has started to officially plan for her White House transition, putting two longtime aides in charge of the effort. John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, will serve as the president and Minyon Moore, a senior adviser, the secretary of the Clinton-Kaine Transition Fund, a nonprofit group that will oversee the effort, according to paperwork filed on Wednesday … A cadre of policy aides to Mrs. Clinton, including Ann O’Leary and Ed Meier, will also help in the transition team’s effort, which will be largely focused on administration and developing a framework for Mrs. Clinton’s policy agenda and personnel appointments.” -- Clinton spent the day Wednesday campaigning in Colorado, zeroing in on the economy as she blasted Trump for manufacturing his products overseas. “If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making things in America - and there’s a lot he could learn by coming here,” Clinton said during a tour of the Knotty Tie company, highlighting a small business with U.S.-based operations.  -- Her visit comes as both Clinton and Trump have begun showering attention on Colorado. And both camps have warned that the state – despite Clinton’s wide lead over Trump in recent polls – is still very much in play. Abby Phillip reports: “Democrats have long hoped that they could make the state more firmly blue. Its relatively large Hispanic population, numerous college campuses and fast-growing urban centers seem to work in their favor. But the state still quietly holds onto its Wild West roots, especially when it comes to politics. Statewide and local races have swung from one party to the other in recent elections."" CNN HOSTS LIBERTARIAN ""TOWN HALL"": -- Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson and running-mate William Weld touted their credentials as former governors, casting both Clinton and Trump as “polarizing” candidates that threaten to divide the country more than ever. “If either Trump or Clinton are elected, things will be more polarized than ever,” Johnson said during the event. “I think it might be refreshing to have a party that was not terribly partisan holding the White House. And we would hire the best people from the Democratic Party that we could find. The smartest people from the Republican Party that we could find. The best people of the Libertarian Party."" (Politico) -- CNN announced it will hold a Green Party forum later this month, modeled after the “town hall” session for Johnson and Weld. In an announcement, CNN promised the likely Green ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka would ""address the current state of the 2016 race and the platform of the Green Party in addition to fielding questions from voters."" (David Weigel) RYAN SUPPORTERS STRONGLY BEHIND HIM BEFORE TUESDAY PRIMARY: -- Conservative Icon Phyllis Schlafly endorsed Paul Nehlen Wednesday, citing his preferences on immigration: ""If [Ryan] can't get in line with [a] majority of the electorate on the biggest issue [immigration], he should resign and we should get someone who fulfills the wishes and the hopes of the majority who just nominated Trump,"" she said in an interview. -- There’s little evidence Trump’s hostility towards Paul Ryan has affected him in his the Wisconsin Republican primary, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports. Only nine percent of Republicans in his district an unfavorable view of him in June and July surveys, while a full 84 percent said they viewed him favorably. (His district standing is similar to statewide numbers.) --And so far, Ryan’s standing among Trump supporters does not seem to have suffered, despite his previous criticisms of the GOP presidential nominee. In Marquette’s last survey taken in early July, Republican voters across the state were asked if they thought Trump or another candidate should be the party’s nominee. Among Wisconsin Republicans who backed Trump, Ryan’s rating was 80 percent. Among “anti-Trump” Republicans in the state, Ryan’s favorability rating was 74 percent. “That is not what you’d expect to see if Ryan’s disagreements with Trump were turning off Trump supporters in the party,” the Journal-Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert concludes.

The portrait of the masked hangman features gallows with two other empty nooses in the background. The hangman wears an axe at this side and blood is visible on his shirt and apron. The tweets, [eventually taken down], were sent in response to another Twitter user who tweeted a picture of a man holding a ‘Republicans for Hillary’ sign.” The county party chairman later apologized, though he had characterized the post in an earlier email as being “nothing more than political satire.”

A specter is haunting the Green Party – the specter of Ralph Nader. This morning, as America’s fourth-largest party gathers in Houston to nominate a presidential ticket, it’s struggling to capture the progressive voters who supported Bernie Sanders. Jill Stein, the party’s likely nominee, was rebuffed when she asked Sanders to join the party, and rebuffed again when she asked popular Sanders surrogate Nina Turner to be her running mate. Why is progressive frustration with Hillary Clinton not boosting the Greens? It’s because sixteen years ago, Green Party nominee Ralph Nader won 2.9 million votes, and at least 2 million of those voters came to blame themselves for the victory of George W. Bush over Al Gore. (The combined vote for Nader and Green candidates since 2000 has never exceeded 900,000.) The 2000 election was one of the founding traumas of the modern center-left. It’s no accident that Stein polls best with voters under 30; liberal voters who remember 2000 are likely to associate “voting your conscience” with giving away the presidency. That’s most evident in the list of Nader supporters from 2000 who have never come back to the Green Party. Nader's running mate that year, Winona LaDuke, endorsed John Kerry in 2004 and then disengaged from politics. Michael Moore, who introduced Nader at some of his rallies, later apologized to Al Gore and has endorsed Democrats for president ever since. Many of the celebrities, academics and intellectuals who backed Nader went on to support Sanders; the only prominent one to support Stein this time is Cornel West. “There were three claims made by Nader in 2000,” said Charles Lenchner, who voted for Nader that year but went on to found the grassroots group People for Bernie. “The first was that there was no substantial difference between Al Gore and George W. Bush. The second was that the campaign would be a boost to local organizing. The third was that the Green Party could emerge as a viable force in our politics. And none of that came to pass.” Nader’s 2000 campaign combined a man and a moment in a way that exhilarated the post-millennium left. Bill Clinton’s presidency was deeply unsatisfying to anti-war and anti-globalist progressives. George W. Bush’s campaign sold itself as a “compassionate” center-right successor to Clinton; for much of 2000, it polled so far ahead of Al Gore’s campaign that a protest vote seemed harmless. And Nader himself was a consumer rights icon whose celebrity transcended right or left. “Ralph Nader was an icon, and he still is an icon,” said Rosa DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, who was running that union’s precursor when it endorsed Nader in 2000. “When you supported him, you were supporting decades of advocacy that you could be proud of.” Stein, by contrast, entered national politics after some success as an environmental activist and Green candidate in Massachusetts. She has never had a following outside of the party, hence her yeoman efforts last week to convince Sanders supporters that they could transfer their hopes into her campaign. But the Bush years and the Trump campaign have prevented the sort of “Tweedledum or Tweedledum” critique of the two parties that made Nader possible. Gore had voted to confirm Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court; Clinton pledges to appoint a liberal justice, and a seat is open. Even Stein struggles to suggest that a Trump presidency would pose the same challenges as a Clinton presidency. The argument for a Green vote this time is more of a bank shot – that four years of total opposition will strengthen the left, or that a Clinton presidency will eventually empower Republicans. “The first term of a Kerry-Edwards administration and a Republican Congress would have implemented precisely the same policies as did the second term of Bush-Cheney in regard to Iraq, the housing market, etc,” said Andrew Bonnell, a professor at Ball State University who signed a 2000 letter of support from academics for Nader. “The landslide that would have swept Mitt Romney or John McCain or whoever into the White House in the aftermath of that presidency might well have made the Republicans unchallengeable at every level of politics for a generation. This time is like that.” That’s more complicated than the argument Nader made in 2000 – that it simply did not matter whether “Gush or Bore” took the White House. Nader, who at age 82 is done with electoral politics, was wry about Stein’s appeal, and skeptical that a third party vote would hold up by election day. After all, his record-high Green Party vote was far short of what polling predicted. “What I’d say to a ‘Bernie or Bust’ person is: Vote for the Green Party agenda and Jill Stein, because it’s the closest agenda to Bernie’s,” said Nader. “But if you called up the head of the DNC, and you said ‘Jill Stein is up to 5 or 8 percent,’ they’d say ‘Relax, she’ll go back to 1 percent.’ That’s what happens to voters on the left. They all get back in the fold the day before the election. They get cold feet.” Nader did not say who he would support (“not Hillary or Trump, as you might guess”), and suggested that voters worrying about a close election in August were getting ahead of themselves. “Let’s see where we are in October,” said Nader, speculating that Trump could collapse in the polls. If Trump did not collapse, even Ralph Nader was willing to understand voters who considered Clinton a “lesser evil,” but were scared of the consequences if they voted for a third party – and Trump won. “If you’re in a deep red or deep blue state, you can vote your conscience,” said Nader. “In the swing states, if you don’t vote your conscience, and you want to vote for Hillary, you have a moral obligation to organize the second she gets elected.”

The funds were deposited by Iran before the 1979 revolution to buy U.S. military equipment, and they were frozen under President Jimmy Carter after Americans were taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Iran has been trying to recover the money ever since, at one point contending that it was owed $10 billion or more with accrued interest. …” -- HOW IT'S PLAYING ON THE TRAIL: Trump falsely claimed he watched footage of the controversial money transfer, telling voters at a Daytona Beach rally that he laid eyes on a months-old video “recorded by the Iranian government and released to embarrass the United States.” From Jenna Johnson:  ""Remember this: Iran — I don't think you heard this anywhere but here — Iran provided all of that footage, the tape of taking that money off the airplane,"" Trump said at the rally. ""Right?"" “Trump provided no source for this exclusive information but described in detail what he saw in the video[:] ‘And they have a perfect tape, done by obviously a government camera, and the tape is of the people taking the money off the plane,” [he said]. ‘Right? That means that in order to embarrass us further, Iran sent us the tapes. …’” What he was likely watching? Dark, grainy and widely-shared footage of the U.S. prisoners apparently landing in Geneva: After his remarks, The Post asked Trump’s spokespeople to clarify what Trump was talking about, emailing a link to a Fox News clip that showed the January footage from Geneva and asking if that was the video the nominee saw. “‘Yes,’ spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded in an email. ‘Merely the b-roll footage included in every broadcast.’ Hicks has yet to respond to a follow-up email asking why Trump thought the footage showed a money transfer and not the … hostage swap, and why Trump said it was recorded by the Iranian government.” Watch Trump tell attendees about the ""secret"" video: He also tweeted about the situation: Some conservatives defended Trump on this one: THE DAILY DONALD: -- “Turmoil in the Republican Party escalated Wednesday as party leaders, strategists and donors voiced increased alarm about the flailing state of Trump’s candidacy and fears that the presidential nominee was damaging the party with an extraordinary week of self-inflicted mistakes, gratuitous attacks and missed opportunities.” From Philip Rucker, Dan Balz and Matea Gold: “RNC Chairman Reince Priebus was described as ‘very frustrated’ with and deeply disturbed by Trump’s behavior over the past week, having run out of excuses to make on the nominee’s behalf to donors and other party leaders … Meanwhile, Trump’s top campaign advisers are struggling once again to instill discipline in their candidate, who has spent recent days lurching from one controversy to another while seemingly skipping chances to go on the offensive against … [Clinton].” -- Top Trump allies publicly urged him to reboot, “furious” at the Republican nominee for both his continued feuding with the parents of dead Army Capt. Humayun Khan, as well as his refusal to endorse Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain in their respective primary elections.  Amid the controversy, Trump suffered two more Republican defections: “Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), an Iraq War veteran, said on CNN that he is unlikely to vote for Trump because the nominee was ‘beginning to cross a lot of red lines of the unforgivable in politics.’” And former Montana governor and RNC chairman Marc Racicot said he will not vote for Trump. “I’m not accusing people of being appeasers, but what I am saying is that there’s a transcendent set of values throughout our history that we subscribe to above party,” Racicot said in an interview, adding that he “thinks Trump lacks those values.” (Check out the full list of Republicans who have vowed not to vote for Trump here.) “People are more frustrated than they have been with past indiscretions,’ said Steve Duprey, a New Hampshire RNC member and confidant of both McCain and Sen. Kelly Ayotte. “People are just going, ‘Can you believe this?’ … Our nominee is losing opportunities to make the case why he should be elected instead of Mrs. Clinton and instead spending all of his time dealing with controversies of his own creation,'"" Phil, Dan and Matea report. “Calling Priebus ‘very frustrated,’ a knowledgeable GOP strategist said, ‘It’s the totality of the week. The whole Khan thing kicking off the week was a concern to him, and then obviously all the other smaller issues were. The [failure to endorse Ryan and McCain] was like the cherry on the cake.’” “[Trump] seems to understand that if you produce a steady stream of sufficiently stupefying statements, there will be no time to dwell on any one of them, and the net effect on the public will be numbness and ennui,” George Will writes in his latest column. “The nation, however, is not immune to the lasting damage that is being done to it by Trump’s success in normalizing post-factual politics. It is being poisoned by the injection into its bloodstream of the cynicism required of those Republicans who persist in pretending that although Trump lies constantly and knows nothing, these blemishes do not disqualify him from being president. It has been well said that ‘sooner or later, we all sit down to a banquet of consequences.’ The Republican Party’s multicourse banquet has begun.” -- Meanwhile, Trump tried to strike a different tone while campaigning in Florida, insisting his campaign is “doing incredibly well” and staffers are working harmoniously. From Susan Cooper Eastman and Jenna Johnson: “’So, I just want to tell you the campaign is doing really well. It's never been so well united. I would say right now it's the best in terms of being united that it's been since we began. We're doing incredibly well,’ Trump said, pointing to polls that show him tied or slightly ahead of Clinton in the battleground states of Florida and Ohio. ‘So I think we've never been this united.’” He struck an upbeat note during the rally, focusing his ire Clinton and the Obama administration, Eastman and Johnson write. He said the U.S. has become “like a third-world nation,” accused Clinton of being ""the founder of ISIS"" and of creating the ""mess"" in Libya, and said he expects to win over Sanders supporters in November. ""Wouldn't that be embarrassing?"" Trump pondered. ""To lose to Crooked Hillary Clinton? That would be terrible."" “Trump also warned that crowd that Clinton might appoint Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to the U.S. Supreme Court — and in doing so, repeatedly referred to Warren as ‘Pocahontas’ because of the controversy over Warren previously claiming to have Native American heritage. ‘If Hillary puts her people on the Supreme Court — okay? — like, who knows,’ Trump said. ‘Elizabeth Warren maybe will go. Maybe. Pocahontas, Pocahontas. They'll put Pocahontas. What an insult to Pocahontas, isn't it? I apologize, ladies and gentlemen, to Pocahontas. But she will put people so far left that our country will become Venezuela.’” He also promised that once he becomes president, police officers will “no longer be shot on the job,” referencing the recent murders of on-duty police officers in Dallas and Louisiana. ""We're going to make our country safe again, and we're going to make our country great again,"" Trump said during a Wednesday night rally. “And we're going to have law and order, and we're going to respect our police, because you have to respect our police. We're not shooting our police. It's never been so dangerous to be a policeman or woman. It's never been so dangerous."" (Jenna Johnson) -- Trump’s campaign is also expanding their media presence as they seek to stop the bleeding and drive home a consistent message. Politico reports the team is bringing in veteran ad man Larry Weitzner, who has worked with both Chris Christie and former New York Gov. George Pataki, to help with the efforts. -- They also released fundraising numbers: Matea Gold reports Trump’s campaign raised $82 million in conjunction with the RNC during the month of July. Per the FEC filings: “…  64 million came in the form of donations contributed online and through direct mail solicitations ... Another $16 million was raised through 20 pricey fundraising events held in conjunction with the RNC. In addition, Trump personally contributed $2 million to his campaign, for a total monthly haul of $82 million.” Clinton, for comparison, pulled in $90 million alongside the DNC last month. -- Trump’s campaign will begin its outreach to African Americans this weekend. Buzzfeed’s Darren Sands and John Stanton outline the upcoming mobilization campaign:  “On Sunday, an entire Charlotte church will endorse Trump. Trump surrogates will attempt a media blitz, trying to engage black women, veterans, and leaders over the next several days, culminating in the church’s endorsement at Antioch Road to Glory International Ministries. ‘Supporting Hillary is like being with an abusive ex, one that you already know left you broken and wounded,’ reads a post on the church’s Facebook page from last month. ‘At this point, give the new guy a chance.’ The event there — ‘A Day of Endorsement’ — will feature a small group of high-profile Trump supporters: black outreach director Omarosa Manigault (an ordained minister); Trump national spokesperson Katrina Pierson; Trump surrogate Pastor Mark Burns … and Eric Trump Foundation VP Lynne Patton. And that’s how Donald Trump’s black outreach campaign will officially begin.” -- DISPATCHES FROM THE TRAIL: The New York Times spent several weeks documenting the angry and provocative comments at Trump rallies. “… What struck us was the frequency with which some Trump supporters use coarse, vitriolic, even violent language — in the epithets they shout and chant, the signs they carry, the T-shirts they wear — a pattern not seen in connection with any other recent political candidate, in any party,” they wrote. Check out their video here. THE DAILY HRC: -- New York Times, “Hillary Clinton Campaign Takes First Steps in Presidential Transition,” from Amy Chozick and Julie Hirschfeld Davis: “With her party’s convention behind her, Hillary Clinton has started to officially plan for her White House transition, putting two longtime aides in charge of the effort. John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, will serve as the president and Minyon Moore, a senior adviser, the secretary of the Clinton-Kaine Transition Fund, a nonprofit group that will oversee the effort, according to paperwork filed on Wednesday … A cadre of policy aides to Mrs. Clinton, including Ann O’Leary and Ed Meier, will also help in the transition team’s effort, which will be largely focused on administration and developing a framework for Mrs. Clinton’s policy agenda and personnel appointments.” -- Clinton spent the day Wednesday campaigning in Colorado, zeroing in on the economy as she blasted Trump for manufacturing his products overseas. “If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making things in America - and there’s a lot he could learn by coming here,” Clinton said during a tour of the Knotty Tie company, highlighting a small business with U.S.-based operations.  -- Her visit comes as both Clinton and Trump have begun showering attention on Colorado. And both camps have warned that the state – despite Clinton’s wide lead over Trump in recent polls – is still very much in play. Abby Phillip reports: “Democrats have long hoped that they could make the state more firmly blue. Its relatively large Hispanic population, numerous college campuses and fast-growing urban centers seem to work in their favor. But the state still quietly holds onto its Wild West roots, especially when it comes to politics. Statewide and local races have swung from one party to the other in recent elections."" CNN HOSTS LIBERTARIAN ""TOWN HALL"": -- Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson and running-mate William Weld touted their credentials as former governors, casting both Clinton and Trump as “polarizing” candidates that threaten to divide the country more than ever. “If either Trump or Clinton are elected, things will be more polarized than ever,” Johnson said during the event. “I think it might be refreshing to have a party that was not terribly partisan holding the White House. And we would hire the best people from the Democratic Party that we could find. The smartest people from the Republican Party that we could find. The best people of the Libertarian Party."" (Politico) -- CNN announced it will hold a Green Party forum later this month, modeled after the “town hall” session for Johnson and Weld. In an announcement, CNN promised the likely Green ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka would ""address the current state of the 2016 race and the platform of the Green Party in addition to fielding questions from voters."" (David Weigel) RYAN SUPPORTERS STRONGLY BEHIND HIM BEFORE TUESDAY PRIMARY: -- Conservative Icon Phyllis Schlafly endorsed Paul Nehlen Wednesday, citing his preferences on immigration: ""If [Ryan] can't get in line with [a] majority of the electorate on the biggest issue [immigration], he should resign and we should get someone who fulfills the wishes and the hopes of the majority who just nominated Trump,"" she said in an interview. -- There’s little evidence Trump’s hostility towards Paul Ryan has affected him in his the Wisconsin Republican primary, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports. Only nine percent of Republicans in his district an unfavorable view of him in June and July surveys, while a full 84 percent said they viewed him favorably. (His district standing is similar to statewide numbers.) --And so far, Ryan’s standing among Trump supporters does not seem to have suffered, despite his previous criticisms of the GOP presidential nominee. In Marquette’s last survey taken in early July, Republican voters across the state were asked if they thought Trump or another candidate should be the party’s nominee. Among Wisconsin Republicans who backed Trump, Ryan’s rating was 80 percent. Among “anti-Trump” Republicans in the state, Ryan’s favorability rating was 74 percent. “That is not what you’d expect to see if Ryan’s disagreements with Trump were turning off Trump supporters in the party,” the Journal-Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert concludes.

The portrait of the masked hangman features gallows with two other empty nooses in the background. The hangman wears an axe at this side and blood is visible on his shirt and apron. The tweets, [eventually taken down], were sent in response to another Twitter user who tweeted a picture of a man holding a ‘Republicans for Hillary’ sign.” The county party chairman later apologized, though he had characterized the post in an earlier email as being “nothing more than political satire.”  
    
   HOT ON THE RIGHT UN backs secret Obama takeover of police, from Polizette: ""United Nations Rapporteur Maina Kai on July 27, a representative of the U.N. Human Rights Council, who on the tail-end of touring the U.S., endorsed a little-known and yet highly controversial practice by the Justice Department to effect a federal takeover of local police and corrections departments ... the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice files a lawsuit in federal court against a city, county, or state, alleging constitutional and civil rights violations by the police or at a corrections facility ... The municipality then simply agrees to the judicial finding — without contest — and the result is a wide-reaching federal court order that imposes onerous regulations on local police.""

0,"THE MORNING PLUM: A barrage of new state and national polls suggesting that Donald Trump may be cratering give rise to a question: Does Trump’s unique awfulness mean that Hillary Clinton can make meaningful inroads among Republican voters? Bloomberg Politics has a good report this morning that details a new effort by the Clinton campaign to make that happen: Clinton and campaign chairman John Podesta already have been directly involved in reaching out to potential Republican recruits, as has Leslie Dach, a former Wal-Mart executive who held positions in the last two Democratic administrations and also is involved in contacting business leaders. The effort is still in its early stages and not yet fully structured, but now is drawing more resources from Clinton’s staff, according to a campaign official who would only discuss the matter on condition of anonymity. The communications team has assigned staff to monitor news accounts of Republicans who say they cannot support Trump or may support Clinton. Some Republicans who’ve made the switch say they’ve been consulted for their views on how to make the outreach effective…. The idea, according to the campaign official, is to create a “permission structure” for rank-and-file voters by showing them locally and nationally respected Republicans who say crossing over for at least at the top of the ticket is the right move for the country. This effort is “real,” according to the judgment of GOP strategist Rick Wilson, who says he thinks GOP voters really could support Clinton. Those voters fall into three groups: “The first group are foreign-policy Republicans who believe Trump may be an existential threat to our country,” he said. “The second group are Republicans who are worried he is going to be an economic disaster. And the third group are what I call the ‘decency Republicans’ who are appalled by his treatment of the Khan family, of the disabled reporter, and of his sort of sadistic and juvenile behavior towards people.” This dovetails very much with the chatter in Democratic circles right now, which holds that Trump’s unique combination of qualities — his ongoing displays of sadism and abusiveness, his obvious temperamental and emotional unfitness for the presidency, his preening ignorance, his lack of curiosity about the world — create a real opportunity to make serious inroads among GOP-leaning constituencies, such as suburban women, college educated whites, and GOP-leaning independents. It’s hard to know how successful that effort will prove. But the current trends suggest that it could get a big assist in coming days, as Republican incumbents and candidates distance themselves from Trump. The New York Times reports: There are now active discussions among high-ranking Republican officials about how much longer the party can wait before recasting their focus away from Mr. Trump and toward down-ballot candidates. One adviser to Mr. Priebus indicated that, much as the party did when Bob Dole’s presidential campaign was flagging in 1996, officials may have to turn their attention to congressional and governors’ races as early as next month. The real point here is that much of this will be made a lot more likely if Trump’s poll numbers continue to crater. As GOP strategist Liam Donovan tweeted, with tongue firmly in cheek: “Given the direction of state and national polling, I’m thinking we might see a sudden outbreak in political courage.” In other words, if Trump continues sliding — and, more importantly, if his unfavorable ratings keep climbing among core voter groups that Republicans can’t afford to continue alienating — more of them will find the “courage” to disassociate themselves from him. And the polling this week suggests that is happening. This week’s CNN poll finds Trump’s unfavorable numbers off the charts with the very groups that Dems hope Trump’s singular wretchedness will allow them to make inroads among: He’s seen unfavorably by 67 percent of women; 73 percent of young voters; 68 percent of white college graduates; and 71 percent of moderates. Those numbers are simply awful. Meanwhile, this week’s CBS poll found that 61 percent of voters say Trump is not prepared for presidency, and 63 percent say he lacks the right temperament for it. Meanwhile, equally large majorities say Clinton does possess those qualities. Trump’s fundamental unfitness for the job is central to any Dem hopes of making real inroads among GOP-leaning constituencies. Again, we don’t know how successful this outreach will be. But it is crucial that these efforts are made. Because now that we have seen the true dimensions of Trumpism — both at Trump’s rage-and-hate convention and in his ongoing attacks on the Khan family, among other things — what is really called for is not simply defeating Trumpism, but defeating it decisively, or even more ideally, crushing it, to whatever degree crushing victories remain possible amid today’s polarization and negative partisanship. ********************************************************************************* * TRUMP, AYOTTE TRAIL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE: A new WBUR poll finds that Hillary Clinton is beating Trump by 15 points among likely voters in New Hampshire, 47-32, and Dem Governor Maggie Hassan leads Senator Kelly Ayotte by ten points, 50-40. Other polls have shown the Senate race is a dead heat. But still, this could be an early indication that Trump may end up dragging down vulnerable GOP Senators. * TRUMP TRAILS IN MICHIGAN: A new Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll finds Clinton up nine points among likely voters in Michigan, 41-32. Note that the pollster says Clinton has a “shocking” lead in the GOP regions of the western and southwestern parts of the state. But Trump told us he is going to put Michigan in play, because he’s doing so awesomely among working class whites, and also, he knows a lot about cars! * TRUMP TRAILS IN PENNSYLVANIA: A new Franklin and Marshall College poll finds Clinton up 11 points among likely voters in Pennsylvania, 49-38. Remember, the Trump campaign itself sees Pennsylvania — along with Florida and Ohio — as absolute must-win states. Taken all together, this new state polling suggests that Trump’s plan to put secret states in play isn’t going too well right now. * TRUMP UNDERPERFORMING WITH…VETERANS? Bloomberg reports that Trump’s ongoing battle with the Khan family may be hurting him with veterans, and he is already underperforming relative to previous GOP nominees: Trump is up 14 points over Clinton with veterans, 53 percent to 39 percent, according to a Fox News 
poll released Wednesday. McCain was 22 points ahead at this 
juncture in the 2008 race with registered voters who had served in the U.S. military; Romney was up 24 points in 
May 2012, Gallup polling showed. But the veterans love Trump, because he’s strong and tough, believe me. * OBAMA’S APPROVAL RISES: A new CNN poll puts Obama’s approval at 54 percent, a four year high. Meanwhile, the new Fox News poll finds it at 52 percent. But those “wrong track” numbers guarantee a Trump victory, haven’t you heard? * AND TRUMP LIES ABOUT CASH TO IRAN: Trump now claims Clinton “started talks to give $400 million in cash to Iran.” Glenn Kessler has a good explainer on what this new right wing obsession is all about: The money was part of a settlement of claims in a dispute over payments for U.S. military equipment that dates back to the late 1970s, and U.S. officials note that the timing overlap with the recent hostage release is coincidental. As for Clinton’s involvement, Kessler notes: “Iran’s claim for the $400 million was made long before Clinton took office — and was resolved after she left.” Details, details…    ","THE MORNING PLUM: A barrage of new state and national polls suggesting that Donald Trump may be cratering give rise to a question: Does Trump’s unique awfulness mean that Hillary Clinton can make meaningful inroads among Republican voters?

0,"THE BIG IDEA: By David Fahrenthold, filling in for James, who is on vacation. I’ve spent the last few months trying to prove Donald Trump right about something important. So far, I’ve failed. Trump has promised to give millions of dollars of his own money to charity. Trying to find evidence of them, I first looked at the Donald J. Trump Foundation. Dead end. Tax records show no gifts from Trump to his namesake foundation since 2008. Then I looked at the Trump campaign's official list of his donations. Dead end. That list included thousands of free rounds of golf, given away by Trump's golf courses. But no gifts of cash from Trump's own pocket. His campaign said those gifts did exist. It just wouldn't say who got them.  So I kept looking, starting with the individual charities that Trump seemed closest to. He'd attended their galas. Praised them on Twitter. Given them cash from the Trump Foundation's dwindling pot of money. I've tried 259 of those charities so far.  I've found one gift, out of Trump's own pocket, between 2008 and this May.  In 2009, he apparently gave a gift worth less than $10,000 to the Police Athletic League in New York. (In May, under pressure from the media, Trump made good on his own pledge to give $1 million to a veterans' charity). But in all those dead ends, I’ve learned a few lessons about Trump, and the way he seems to view charity.  So here’s what I found, when I wasn’t finding anything: 1. Trump does see charity — or at least the appearance of charity — as an important part of his public image This started back in the 1980s, when Trump first became a national star with his book, ""The Art of the Deal."" Even then, his public persona had two very different sides. On the one hand, Trump portrayed himself as a walking avatar of wealth, so rich he didn't need more money. On the other hand, here he was, asking for your money, trying to sell you a book. Trump split the difference by promising to give the book's proceeds to charity. In the 2000s, when Trump returned to the national spotlight, he picked up the habit again. At various times, he promised to give away the proceeds of ""The Apprentice,"" ""Trump University"" and a real-estate rental to Moammar Gaddafi. As much as Trump cultivated the image of himself as a hard-nosed, high-living businessman, he seemed not to think that one dimension was enough. Until recently, Trump's corporate biography summed his life up into two parts: ""a deal-maker without peer, and an ardent philanthropist.""  2. But Trump seems to want to acquire his reputation for charity as cheaply as possible, and with other people's money if he can In all, I've identified about $7.8 million that Trump has given to charity since 1984. That's a great deal of money, but it is a rather paltry sum for a billionaire. If Trump is worth $10 billion now, as he claims, then his lifetime charity would be equal to 0.08 percent of his current net worth. Star Wars' George Lucas, who is tied with Trump on Forbes's list of billionaires, gave $925 million to charity in a single recent year. Despite this relatively low total, Trump has employed a pair of strategies to make his charitable impact seem more impressive. For one thing, he frequently attends charity galas and events, where attendance carries the implication (but not the requirement) that guests have made donations to the cause. I've even found galas where Trump was given a title like ""honorary chairman"" — with the implication of an even bigger gift — but actually gave nothing. In fact, Trump often *made* money on these galas, since they were held at his Florida clubs. Several of the charities said they were glad to have Trump as the honorary chairman anyway, since Trump's name drew a crowd. Separately, Trump seems to exploit the assumption that the money in the Donald J. Trump Foundation came originally from Donald J. Trump's pocket. It doesn't, and hasn't for years. Instead, the foundation's biggest recent gifts came from wrestling moguls Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave a total $5 million (and won't comment about why). Since then, Trump has been effectively giving the McMahons' money away, but — because his name is on the foundation — the recipients often give Trump the credit. 3. Trump is left with a charitable legacy that is small and scattershot, with little sustained commitment to any one cause The two biggest gifts of Trump's life have been to veterans' groups: $1 million for the New York City Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1984, and the $1 million he gave to a veterans' charity this May. In between, however, his public giving showed little focus on veterans' issues, or any other specific causes. The largest gifts from the Donald J. Trump Foundation have been split among local New York charities, Palm Beach galas, conservative political groups — and one-off gifts, like one Trump apparently paid to settle a lawsuit at one of his golf courses. By spreading out his money this way, Trump has increased the short-term visibility of his charity, but diminished its long-term impact in any one place. The result is that — although Trump has put his name on commercial ventures from steaks to books to casinos — he has left few monuments to himself in the world of philanthropy. Trump's son Eric, by contrast, started a foundation focused on children's cancer research. Now, at age 32, Eric Trump has a surgical center named for him at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.  The only things I've found that a charity named in honor of Donald Trump are far less impressive. There's a bench in Central Park, and a single chair in a theater in New Jersey.    One last thing, readers: If you know of any donations Trump gave to a charity out of his own pocket — or if you've spotted another monument to his giving — please let me know!

 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: Trump continues to tank in a round of fresh polling. A sign that his problems may go to the heart of his candidacy: While Hillary Clinton is crushing The Donald with nonwhite voters, she is also closing in on him among his core constituencies — whites and men. -- Clinton surged to a FIFTEEN-point lead in a fresh McClatchy-Marist poll of national voters. She now has a 48 to 33 percent advantage over Trump, who fell six points since the last survey. -- Hillary jumped to a NINE-point lead in an NBC-WSJ poll, nearly doubling the five-point advantage she held over Trump ahead of the party’s nominating conventions. -- And she’s also gaining among Trump in key swing states: Clinton holds a six-point lead in Florida, according to a new Suffolk University survey, up 48 to his 42 percent. Regionally, Clinton is strongest in heavily Latino south Florida, where she hold a 24- point lead. Meanwhile, Trump polls best in northern Florida, where he leads Clinton 54 to 39 percent.   -- The Post looked at an average of the major recent polls, compiled by RealClearPolitics. Per that aggregation, Clinton has gained four points and now leads in the average by seven points — putting Trump further back than Romney ever was, Philip Bump observes. “Relative to Election Day in 2004, 2008 and 2012, Clinton's lead is more than twice that of the eventual victor at this point. In 2004, [Bush] had a 6-point lead for a few weeks; in 2008, Obama led by 6 points or more for the final month or so. Other than that, though, Clinton's lead is exceptional. Trump now trails Hillary Clinton in the polling average by more than Mitt Romney ever did in the final 150 days. In fact, Romney never trailed by that much for the last year of the campaign.” “The smartest thing Trump could do when asked about his poll problems is to note that Clinton is enjoying a very traditional convention bounce and that the race will eventually settle down.…” Chris Cillizza writes. “But Trump rarely does the politically smart thing — particularly when he feels betrayed by the same polls that were so good to him for so long. And there are already indications that Trump — a friend spurned — is going to burn the bridges of his past close relationship with polls. ‘I think these polls — I don't know — there's something about these polls, there's something phony,’ Trump said Tuesday at a rally in Loudoun County, Va. Right.” Correction: We inaccurately stated in the original version that Clinton had a 10-point lead over Trump in the new McClatchy-Marist poll. Her lead is actually 15 points. SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE FEELING THE HEAT: -- “There is good news in this volatile election year for Senate Republicans struggling to hold on to their seats: There is mounting evidence that voters are willing to support them even if they won’t back Trump. The bad news is that still may not be enough to save the Republican Senate majority.” From Mike DeBonis: “New polls released in several battleground states this week show incumbent GOP senators consistently outperforming [Trump] among general-election voters. But Trump’s unpopularity threatens to swallow that advantage. The GOP currently enjoys a 54-seat Senate majority, but they are defending a dozen competitive seats, while Democrats are defending just two. A four-seat swing toward the Democrats would flip control of the Senate if Clinton were to beat Trump on Nov. 8. That math and the new surveys are why Trump’s recent polling nosedive is triggering Klaxon horns in Republican circles around Washington.” If you read one story that’s NOT about Trump or Clinton today: From Souad Mekhennet and Greg Miller: “Bloodline: He’s the son of Osama bin Laden’s bombmaker. Then ISIS wanted him as one of their own:” “He was still a teenager when he wandered into one of the buildings at the dusty hilltop complex looking for the cages where rabbits were kept. Inside, he found a crudely equipped laboratory.… ‘I asked my father, ‘What are you doing here?’’ [Mohammed al-Masri] said.… His father’s response was cryptic: ‘When you grow up, God willing, you will learn for yourself.’ After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Masri’s father would be regarded as one of the most ominous figures in al-Qaeda: an Egyptian with a degree in chemistry who was put in charge of the terrorist network’s effort to develop mass-casualty weapons. Mohammed Masri, now 35, left Afghanistan shortly after that mid-1990s exchange … and never saw his father again. But that notorious lineage has clung to the younger Masri like a toxic residue, complicating his efforts to make his own mark as an Islamist militant, most recently in Syria.  MORE ON THE WAR AGAINST ISIS: -- Obama met with his National Security Council at the Pentagon Thursday to discuss the war against the Islamic State. From Greg Jaffe, David Nakamura and William Branigin:  In a news conference following the briefing, the president warned that ISIS is “inevitably going to be defeated,” but predicted that the dispersed terrorist networks it spawns are likely to persist with attempted attacks, even after the group loses its major strongholds in Iraq and Syria. “Obama pointed to a string of battlefield defeats, suffered by the Islamic State in the last year, as proof that the group is ‘not invincible,’ and said that U.S.-backed Iraq forces would use a recently recaptured air base as a hub to take back Mosul.… ‘ISIL has not been able to reclaim any significant territory that they have lost,” Obama said. “I want to repeat, ISIL has not had a major successful offensive operation in either Syria or Iraq in a full year. Even ISIL’s leaders know they’re going to keep losing.’” GET SMART FAST:​​ THE DAILY DONALD: -- Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort sought to tamp down controversy surrounding Trump’s refusal to support Paul Ryan in his Wisconsin Republican primary, suggesting his behavior is “not unusual or newsworthy.” From Jenna Johnson: “We've sort of had a rule of not getting involved in primaries because it's usually not a good situation for the presidential candidate,"" campaign chairman Paul Manafort said on ABC News' ""Good Morning America.” ""Of course he's going to work with Paul Ryan. Of course, he's tried to bridge the party together with Paul Ryan. But Ryan's also running against somebody who's not going to win — but, nonetheless, he's a strong supporter of Mr. Trump's. And so it's not just in Paul Ryan's district. That gets all of the notoriety because it's the speaker."" -- Former House speaker and close Trump adviser Newt Gingrich endorsed Sen. John McCain’s reelection campaign, breaking ranks with the Republican nominee as he touted McCain as a “national treasure.” “I strongly endorse Senator John McCain,"" Gingrich said in a video address. ""A genuine American hero, a man who has endured a great deal for his country … I know how hard John works for veterans, for the military, for our national security -- and I know that John McCain is a national treasure.” Trump has repeatedly hit McCain on the campaign trail, accusing him of “not doing enough” to help military veterans. Last year, he suggested the Arizona senator was only a war hero “because he was captured.” (Jenna Johnson) --Trump's running-mate, Mike Pence, was engaged in his own mini-controversy yesterday over whether he backs Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) in their reelection campaigns. Bottom line: he does, but it took him awhile to say so. The incident highlights the problems for Pence in running with Trump, whose positions verge so often with GOP elders with whom Pence has close ties. Here's how things played out: -- LET MIKE BE MIKE? “In the opening weeks of their partnership, Trump has granted his running mate broad leeway with no precedent in recent presidential campaigns, amplifying [their] differences in style and substance,” Jose A. DelReal and Sean Sullivan report. “For a campaign whose mantra long has been ‘Let Trump be Trump,’ the guiding principle that has formed around Pence is, as one of the aides put it, ‘Let Mike be Mike.’ The strategy amounts to a high-risk, high-reward proposition. Trump advisers believe Pence could help repackage the ticket for voters turned off by Trump: Where Trump is brash and bristly, Pence is cool and collected. Trump shoots from the hip, but Pence is cautious. But at times Trump and Pence deliver contradictory, even awkward messages … It has become clear that the two men are intentionally speaking to different groups of voters — Trump to frustrated and restive outsiders and Pence to mainstream conservatives and Republican establishment figures."" -- Paul Ryan sent an urgent fundraising appeal Thursday, warning supporters that should they fail to protect the Republican majority in Congress, “we could be handing President Hillary Clinton a blank check.” “Whether or not it was intentional, the phrase ‘blank check” has a political echo,” Jenna Johnson and Karen Tumulty write, “one that suggests a deep fear by congressional Republicans that a sinking presidential candidate could take their majorities in the House and Senate with him, and that they are getting ready to desert him.” Ryan used the words “blank check” at least THREE times Thursday, repeatedly invoking the loaded phrase as Trump sought to rebound from weeks of self-inflicted wounds. -- Trump’s campaign is holding nearly two dozen high-dollar fundraisers in conjunction with the RNC this month, Sean Sullivan and Matea Gold report. Trump’s joint fundraising committee with the RNC, “Trump Victory,” has 21 finance events on the book for August alone. On Saturday, Trump is set to headline events in Nantucket and on Cape Cod, the latter of which will be held at the home of billionaire energy executive Bill Koch.  “The whirlwind-pace full calendar, coming during what is typically a relatively sleepy late summer period in the political world, highlights the urgency with which Republicans are trying to keep pace with [Clinton] in the money chase,” Sullivan and Gold add. “And it shows that there is a continuing appetite among party donors to back the billionaire real estate mogul, despite his stumbles on the campaign trail.” PROMINENT REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO DUMP TRUMP: -- Several Republicans are among a group of former cabinet officers, senior officials and career military officers who denounced Trump on Thursday, slamming his recent remarks on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia as “disgraceful.” “’These are disgraceful statements that betray our long-standing values and national interests embraced by presidents of both parties,’ said the letter, signed by former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former CIA director and defense secretary Leon Panetta. ‘We find Trump’s comments to be reckless, dangerous, and extremely unwise.’” “America needs a president who will strengthen our alliances,” it concludes, “not denigrate and destroy them.” (Anne Gearan) -- Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani says Trump should refrain from attacking McCain, Ayotte, Ryan, or the Khans: “If you shoot somebody in politics, they shoot back at you,” Giuliani said on Kilmeade and Friends. “My advice to Donald in private is the same as it is in public. Keep your eye on the ball and the ball is Hillary Clinton.” (Buzzfeed) -- New York Times, “Donald Tru mp Risks Alienating Military Communities in Swing States,” by Alexander Burns, Noah Remnick and Nick Corasaniti: “...he has also risked alienating an even more pivotal constituency in the swing states that will decide the presidential election: military communities dismayed by his crude and at times offensive comments about the armed services. These missteps threaten Mr. Trump in the heart of the electoral map. In several important states, his most realistic path to victory hinges on areas with close ties to the military, including northern Florida, coastal Virginia and New Hampshire, and a cluster of towns near military bases in North Carolina, Colorado and Arizona. Should even a segment of Republican-leaning military voters recoil from Mr. Trump, it could badly undermine him in states where he is already struggling because of his deep unpopularity with women and racial minorities …” -- The Harvard Republican Club announced it will NOT be backing Trump, urging voters to withdraw their support from the man they deigned a “threat to the survival of the Republic.” From the Harvard Crimson: ""His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy,"" read a statement from the group. ""He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House."" ...THE PUNDITS WEIGH IN, continuing to call into question Trump's SANITY: -- NYT’s David Brooks calls Trump a “political rampage, charging ever more wildly out of control:"" “With each passing week he displays the classic symptoms of medium-grade mania in more disturbing forms: inflated self-esteem, sleeplessness, impulsivity, aggression and a compulsion to offer advice on subjects he knows nothing about,"" Brooks writes. ""His speech patterns are like something straight out of a psychiatric textbook. As one trained psychiatrist said to me, compare Donald Trump’s speaking patterns to a Robin Williams monologue, but with insults instead of jokes ..."" But Brooks also warns Republicans who have sided with Trump that their positions are untenable and history will not regard them kindly: ""Events are going to force Republicans off the fence. For the past many months Republican leaders have been condemning Trump’s acts while sticking with Trump the man. Trump is making that position ridiculous and shameful. You either stand with a man whose very essence is an insult to basic decency, or you don’t. Those who don’t will have to start building a Republican Party in Exile. They will have to tell the country what they honestly think of Donald Trump. They will have to build a parallel campaign structure that will survive if Trump implodes, a structure of congressional and local candidates ... There comes a time when neutrality and laying low become dishonorable. If you’re not in revolt, you’re in cahoots. When this period and your name are mentioned, decades hence, your grandkids will look away in shame."" -- Trump’s attack on the Gold Star family was not a mistake, Charles Krauthammer writes: “It was a revelation. It’s that he can’t help himself. His governing rule in life is to strike back when attacked, disrespected or even slighted. To understand Trump, you have to grasp the General Theory: He judges every action, every pronouncement, every person by a single criterion — whether or not it/he is ‘nice’ to Trump. Treat him ‘unfairly’ and you will pay. House speaker, Gold Star mother, it matters not. I used to think Trump was an 11-year-old, an undeveloped schoolyard bully. I was off by about 10 years. His needs are more primitive, an infantile hunger for approval and praise, a craving that can never be satisfied. He lives in a cocoon of solipsism where the world outside himself has value — indeed exists — only insofar as it sustains and inflates him.” -- “Trump is many things, some of them dark and dangerous, but at his core, he is a B.S. artist,” Fareed Zakaria writes: “He boasts — and boasts and boasts — about his business, his buildings, his books, his wives. Much of it is a concoction of hyperbole and falsehoods. And when he’s found out, he’s like that guy we have all met at a bar who makes wild claims but when confronted with the truth, quickly responds, ‘I knew that!’ … As the crazy talk continues, standard rules of fact, truth and reality have disappeared in this campaign. Donald Trump has piled such vast quantities of his trademark product into the political arena that the stench is now overwhelming and unbearable.” THE DAILY HRC: -- “Clinton broadens campaign effort to target wary Republicans,” by Anne Gearan, Abby Phillip and John Wagner: “Clinton’s campaign is quietly broadening its outreach to potential Republican converts, including donors, elected officials, and business and foreign policy leaders. The message is simple: Even if you have never before considered voting for a Democrat, and even if you don’t like Clinton, choosing her this year is a moral and patriotic imperative. The recruitment is a continuation of the campaign’s efforts to sway influential Republicans and independents …” The recruitment appeal reportedly includes personal appeals by senior Democrats, including Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The campaign is also tracking Republicans who have spoken out against Trump in public."" -- Clinton’s campaign removed its state-specific ads in Virginia and Colorado, showing signs of confidence in both battleground states. From Abby Phillip: “According to a Democrat tracking media buys, the Clinton campaign has renewed its ad buys in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, and North Carolina. But it allowed its state-specific ads in Virginia and Colorado to lapse … The decisions come as a slew of new national and battleground state polls gives Clinton wide leads over [Trump].” Her super PAC also will not advertise in either state for the next two weeks. -- Tim Kaine defended Clinton on her private email server, saying he trusts that his running-mate is being honest when she answers questions about her email practices at the State Department. “Hillary and I have talked about this personally and we sat down within minutes after I was rolled out as her running mate to do a ‘60 Minutes’ interview and she said, 'I made a mistake. I screwed up and I learned something and I'll do it differently,” Kaine said on “CBS This Morning.” “That's been the way she's pitched it to me and I think that's the honest response and I've heard her say that a number of times."" -- New York Times, “With Billionaires Backing Her, Hillary Clinton Must Confront How to Deploy Them,” by Amy Chozick: “Now that Hillary Clinton has assembled a bipartisan cadre of billionaires to support her candidacy, how does she disperse the moneyed elite to help her in a campaign focused on income inequality? Warren E. Buffett … was easy. The low-key billionaire has been at the forefront of efforts to rewrite the tax code so that he does not pay a lower rate than his secretary. Meg Whitman, the technology executive and former Republican candidate for governor in California, said she would hold a fund-raiser to help elect Mrs. Clinton. Reed Hastings, the outspoken chief executive of Netflix, and Eric Schmidt, of Google fame, have both expressed support for Mrs. Clinton’s technology and business plans.” And Mark Cuban, the co-host of ABC’s entrepreneurial “Shark Tank,” hopes to focus on income inequality and a tax plan offering incentives for companies who share profits with employees."" WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: -- “Rio may be the glummest city ever to host the Summer Olympics,” by Joshua Partlow and Dom Phillips: “On Oct. 9, 2009, when the International Olympic Committee selected Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 Summer Games, confetti fell over a delirious crowd on Copacabana Beach … This was a country poised to knock on the First World’s door, an economic powerhouse with boundless natural wealth, the leader of a peaceful region  ...“[Now] … the mood is apprehensive, almost queasy. A recent poll found that nearly 2 out of 3 Brazilians expect the Olympics to bring more losses than benefits. Soldiers wearing camouflage are posted at bridges, subway platforms and beaches. ‘There was a moment of megalomaniacal euphoria,’ [said former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso]. ‘As if Brazil … already belonged in the First World. ‘Now we are in doubt: Are we really capable or not?’” --  An online petition is urging Khizr Khan, the father of an Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq, to run for Virginia legislature. From Jenna Portnoy: “In the week since Khizr Khan … made an impassioned call to elect Clinton, some of his supporters have found another person they’d like to see in public office: Khan. Thomas Keefe, a Vietnam veteran and longtime Democratic activist, watched the Khans from backstage at the convention and thought of his son’s friend who died while serving in Afghanistan … By the time Keefe, 67, had returned home to Knoxville, Tenn., he had resolved to send a message to Trump about the kind of leadership he believes Americans deserve. So he started a digital crowdfunding campaign intended to recruit Khan to run for the Virginia House of Delegates, complete with a bumper-sticker-ready slogan: ‘Yes We Khan!’ Through the platform Crowdpac, 123 individuals pledged more than $13,000 in less than two days. Keefe hopes to reach $20,000 by Monday …” (So far, Khan appears unlikely to take the bait – he declined comment Wednesday night, saying only “We are grateful for the pouring of love, support and respect.”) DISPATCHES FROM JANESVILLE...NEHLEN AS 'MINI-TRUMP:' -- Politico, “Mini-Trump goes after Ryan in his own backyard,” by Rachael Bade: “In an abandoned parking lot on the outskirts of Paul Ryan’s hometown, Paul Nehlen railed against what he called the House speaker’s ‘open borders policies; and claimed Ryan is ‘giving American jobs to foreigners.’ “I was on CNN last night and this morning! Lot of shows,’ the 47-year-old longtime factory manager exclaimed in Trump-like fashion to the small crowd. ‘It’s going to be full-court press.’ A yellow construction dump truck behind him was painted with, ‘Dump Paul Ryan’ and ‘Get the dirt on Ryan.’ It turns out that Ryan — who’s been plagued by Trump on Capitol Hill for the better part of a year — can’t even avoid the guy in his own backyard. Ryan may be one of the most popular figures in the Republican Party, but Nehlen, a remarkably well-financed gadfly running a mini-version of the real estate tycoon’s campaign, is forcing the House speaker and nine-term congressman to have to defend himself in a primary for the first time in years. Despite his obvious deficiencies (Ryan is expected to clobber him in the primary) Nehlen has seized on the same working-class discontent that Trump rode to the nomination, forcing Ryan to face down the GOP’s new, populist brand of Republicanism at home …” -- Ann Coulter is also planning to hit the campaign trail for Paul Nehlen: She is slated to appear alongside Nehlen at two televised rallies in the state, per a media advisory from the campaign.   -- “On the ground here in southeastern Wisconsin in a district dotted with factories and cornfields, there are few signs that the news media glow surrounding Mr. Nehlen has rubbed off on voters,” the New York Times reports. “This is one of those campaigns that looks big on social media and in certain conservative media, but when you get down on the ground in Racine, in Kenosha and Janesville, it’s just not there,” said Charlie Sykes, a conservative radio host who holds sway among Republicans here. “The grass-roots Republican activists are not divided on Paul Ryan.” SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: After a delay, Pence endorsed McCain and Ayotte's reelection bids.

(warning: adult language)","THE BIG IDEA: By David Fahrenthold, filling in for James, who is on vacation. I’ve spent the last few months trying to prove Donald Trump right about something important. So far, I’ve failed. Trump has promised to give millions of dollars of his own money to charity. Trying to find evidence of them, I first looked at the Donald J. Trump Foundation. Dead end. Tax records show no gifts from Trump to his namesake foundation since 2008. Then I looked at the Trump campaign's official list of his donations. Dead end. That list included thousands of free rounds of golf, given away by Trump's golf courses. But no gifts of cash from Trump's own pocket. His campaign said those gifts did exist. It just wouldn't say who got them.  So I kept looking, starting with the individual charities that Trump seemed closest to. He'd attended their galas. Praised them on Twitter. Given them cash from the Trump Foundation's dwindling pot of money. I've tried 259 of those charities so far.  I've found one gift, out of Trump's own pocket, between 2008 and this May.  In 2009, he apparently gave a gift worth less than $10,000 to the Police Athletic League in New York. (In May, under pressure from the media, Trump made good on his own pledge to give $1 million to a veterans' charity). But in all those dead ends, I’ve learned a few lessons about Trump, and the way he seems to view charity.  So here’s what I found, when I wasn’t finding anything: 1. Trump does see charity — or at least the appearance of charity — as an important part of his public image This started back in the 1980s, when Trump first became a national star with his book, ""The Art of the Deal."" Even then, his public persona had two very different sides. On the one hand, Trump portrayed himself as a walking avatar of wealth, so rich he didn't need more money. On the other hand, here he was, asking for your money, trying to sell you a book. Trump split the difference by promising to give the book's proceeds to charity. In the 2000s, when Trump returned to the national spotlight, he picked up the habit again. At various times, he promised to give away the proceeds of ""The Apprentice,"" ""Trump University"" and a real-estate rental to Moammar Gaddafi. As much as Trump cultivated the image of himself as a hard-nosed, high-living businessman, he seemed not to think that one dimension was enough. Until recently, Trump's corporate biography summed his life up into two parts: ""a deal-maker without peer, and an ardent philanthropist.""  2. But Trump seems to want to acquire his reputation for charity as cheaply as possible, and with other people's money if he can In all, I've identified about $7.8 million that Trump has given to charity since 1984. That's a great deal of money, but it is a rather paltry sum for a billionaire. If Trump is worth $10 billion now, as he claims, then his lifetime charity would be equal to 0.08 percent of his current net worth. Star Wars' George Lucas, who is tied with Trump on Forbes's list of billionaires, gave $925 million to charity in a single recent year. Despite this relatively low total, Trump has employed a pair of strategies to make his charitable impact seem more impressive. For one thing, he frequently attends charity galas and events, where attendance carries the implication (but not the requirement) that guests have made donations to the cause. I've even found galas where Trump was given a title like ""honorary chairman"" — with the implication of an even bigger gift — but actually gave nothing. In fact, Trump often *made* money on these galas, since they were held at his Florida clubs. Several of the charities said they were glad to have Trump as the honorary chairman anyway, since Trump's name drew a crowd. Separately, Trump seems to exploit the assumption that the money in the Donald J. Trump Foundation came originally from Donald J. Trump's pocket. It doesn't, and hasn't for years. Instead, the foundation's biggest recent gifts came from wrestling moguls Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave a total $5 million (and won't comment about why). Since then, Trump has been effectively giving the McMahons' money away, but — because his name is on the foundation — the recipients often give Trump the credit. 3. Trump is left with a charitable legacy that is small and scattershot, with little sustained commitment to any one cause The two biggest gifts of Trump's life have been to veterans' groups: $1 million for the New York City Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1984, and the $1 million he gave to a veterans' charity this May. In between, however, his public giving showed little focus on veterans' issues, or any other specific causes. The largest gifts from the Donald J. Trump Foundation have been split among local New York charities, Palm Beach galas, conservative political groups — and one-off gifts, like one Trump apparently paid to settle a lawsuit at one of his golf courses. By spreading out his money this way, Trump has increased the short-term visibility of his charity, but diminished its long-term impact in any one place. The result is that — although Trump has put his name on commercial ventures from steaks to books to casinos — he has left few monuments to himself in the world of philanthropy. Trump's son Eric, by contrast, started a foundation focused on children's cancer research. Now, at age 32, Eric Trump has a surgical center named for him at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.  The only things I've found that a charity named in honor of Donald Trump are far less impressive. There's a bench in Central Park, and a single chair in a theater in New Jersey.    One last thing, readers: If you know of any donations Trump gave to a charity out of his own pocket — or if you've spotted another monument to his giving — please let me know!

 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: Trump continues to tank in a round of fresh polling. A sign that his problems may go to the heart of his candidacy: While Hillary Clinton is crushing The Donald with nonwhite voters, she is also closing in on him among his core constituencies — whites and men. -- Clinton surged to a FIFTEEN-point lead in a fresh McClatchy-Marist poll of national voters. She now has a 48 to 33 percent advantage over Trump, who fell six points since the last survey. -- Hillary jumped to a NINE-point lead in an NBC-WSJ poll, nearly doubling the five-point advantage she held over Trump ahead of the party’s nominating conventions. -- And she’s also gaining among Trump in key swing states: Clinton holds a six-point lead in Florida, according to a new Suffolk University survey, up 48 to his 42 percent. Regionally, Clinton is strongest in heavily Latino south Florida, where she hold a 24- point lead. Meanwhile, Trump polls best in northern Florida, where he leads Clinton 54 to 39 percent.   -- The Post looked at an average of the major recent polls, compiled by RealClearPolitics. Per that aggregation, Clinton has gained four points and now leads in the average by seven points — putting Trump further back than Romney ever was, Philip Bump observes. “Relative to Election Day in 2004, 2008 and 2012, Clinton's lead is more than twice that of the eventual victor at this point. In 2004, [Bush] had a 6-point lead for a few weeks; in 2008, Obama led by 6 points or more for the final month or so. Other than that, though, Clinton's lead is exceptional. Trump now trails Hillary Clinton in the polling average by more than Mitt Romney ever did in the final 150 days. In fact, Romney never trailed by that much for the last year of the campaign.” “The smartest thing Trump could do when asked about his poll problems is to note that Clinton is enjoying a very traditional convention bounce and that the race will eventually settle down.…” Chris Cillizza writes. “But Trump rarely does the politically smart thing — particularly when he feels betrayed by the same polls that were so good to him for so long. And there are already indications that Trump — a friend spurned — is going to burn the bridges of his past close relationship with polls. ‘I think these polls — I don't know — there's something about these polls, there's something phony,’ Trump said Tuesday at a rally in Loudoun County, Va. Right.” Correction: We inaccurately stated in the original version that Clinton had a 10-point lead over Trump in the new McClatchy-Marist poll. Her lead is actually 15 points. SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE FEELING THE HEAT: -- “There is good news in this volatile election year for Senate Republicans struggling to hold on to their seats: There is mounting evidence that voters are willing to support them even if they won’t back Trump. The bad news is that still may not be enough to save the Republican Senate majority.” From Mike DeBonis: “New polls released in several battleground states this week show incumbent GOP senators consistently outperforming [Trump] among general-election voters. But Trump’s unpopularity threatens to swallow that advantage. The GOP currently enjoys a 54-seat Senate majority, but they are defending a dozen competitive seats, while Democrats are defending just two. A four-seat swing toward the Democrats would flip control of the Senate if Clinton were to beat Trump on Nov. 8. That math and the new surveys are why Trump’s recent polling nosedive is triggering Klaxon horns in Republican circles around Washington.” If you read one story that’s NOT about Trump or Clinton today: From Souad Mekhennet and Greg Miller: “Bloodline: He’s the son of Osama bin Laden’s bombmaker. Then ISIS wanted him as one of their own:” “He was still a teenager when he wandered into one of the buildings at the dusty hilltop complex looking for the cages where rabbits were kept. Inside, he found a crudely equipped laboratory.… ‘I asked my father, ‘What are you doing here?’’ [Mohammed al-Masri] said.… His father’s response was cryptic: ‘When you grow up, God willing, you will learn for yourself.’ After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Masri’s father would be regarded as one of the most ominous figures in al-Qaeda: an Egyptian with a degree in chemistry who was put in charge of the terrorist network’s effort to develop mass-casualty weapons. Mohammed Masri, now 35, left Afghanistan shortly after that mid-1990s exchange … and never saw his father again. But that notorious lineage has clung to the younger Masri like a toxic residue, complicating his efforts to make his own mark as an Islamist militant, most recently in Syria.  MORE ON THE WAR AGAINST ISIS: -- Obama met with his National Security Council at the Pentagon Thursday to discuss the war against the Islamic State. From Greg Jaffe, David Nakamura and William Branigin:  In a news conference following the briefing, the president warned that ISIS is “inevitably going to be defeated,” but predicted that the dispersed terrorist networks it spawns are likely to persist with attempted attacks, even after the group loses its major strongholds in Iraq and Syria. “Obama pointed to a string of battlefield defeats, suffered by the Islamic State in the last year, as proof that the group is ‘not invincible,’ and said that U.S.-backed Iraq forces would use a recently recaptured air base as a hub to take back Mosul.… ‘ISIL has not been able to reclaim any significant territory that they have lost,” Obama said. “I want to repeat, ISIL has not had a major successful offensive operation in either Syria or Iraq in a full year. Even ISIL’s leaders know they’re going to keep losing.’” GET SMART FAST:​​ THE DAILY DONALD: -- Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort sought to tamp down controversy surrounding Trump’s refusal to support Paul Ryan in his Wisconsin Republican primary, suggesting his behavior is “not unusual or newsworthy.” From Jenna Johnson: “We've sort of had a rule of not getting involved in primaries because it's usually not a good situation for the presidential candidate,"" campaign chairman Paul Manafort said on ABC News' ""Good Morning America.” ""Of course he's going to work with Paul Ryan. Of course, he's tried to bridge the party together with Paul Ryan. But Ryan's also running against somebody who's not going to win — but, nonetheless, he's a strong supporter of Mr. Trump's. And so it's not just in Paul Ryan's district. That gets all of the notoriety because it's the speaker."" -- Former House speaker and close Trump adviser Newt Gingrich endorsed Sen. John McCain’s reelection campaign, breaking ranks with the Republican nominee as he touted McCain as a “national treasure.” “I strongly endorse Senator John McCain,"" Gingrich said in a video address. ""A genuine American hero, a man who has endured a great deal for his country … I know how hard John works for veterans, for the military, for our national security -- and I know that John McCain is a national treasure.” Trump has repeatedly hit McCain on the campaign trail, accusing him of “not doing enough” to help military veterans. Last year, he suggested the Arizona senator was only a war hero “because he was captured.” (Jenna Johnson) --Trump's running-mate, Mike Pence, was engaged in his own mini-controversy yesterday over whether he backs Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) in their reelection campaigns. Bottom line: he does, but it took him awhile to say so. The incident highlights the problems for Pence in running with Trump, whose positions verge so often with GOP elders with whom Pence has close ties. Here's how things played out: -- LET MIKE BE MIKE? “In the opening weeks of their partnership, Trump has granted his running mate broad leeway with no precedent in recent presidential campaigns, amplifying [their] differences in style and substance,” Jose A. DelReal and Sean Sullivan report. “For a campaign whose mantra long has been ‘Let Trump be Trump,’ the guiding principle that has formed around Pence is, as one of the aides put it, ‘Let Mike be Mike.’ The strategy amounts to a high-risk, high-reward proposition. Trump advisers believe Pence could help repackage the ticket for voters turned off by Trump: Where Trump is brash and bristly, Pence is cool and collected. Trump shoots from the hip, but Pence is cautious. But at times Trump and Pence deliver contradictory, even awkward messages … It has become clear that the two men are intentionally speaking to different groups of voters — Trump to frustrated and restive outsiders and Pence to mainstream conservatives and Republican establishment figures."" -- Paul Ryan sent an urgent fundraising appeal Thursday, warning supporters that should they fail to protect the Republican majority in Congress, “we could be handing President Hillary Clinton a blank check.” “Whether or not it was intentional, the phrase ‘blank check” has a political echo,” Jenna Johnson and Karen Tumulty write, “one that suggests a deep fear by congressional Republicans that a sinking presidential candidate could take their majorities in the House and Senate with him, and that they are getting ready to desert him.” Ryan used the words “blank check” at least THREE times Thursday, repeatedly invoking the loaded phrase as Trump sought to rebound from weeks of self-inflicted wounds. -- Trump’s campaign is holding nearly two dozen high-dollar fundraisers in conjunction with the RNC this month, Sean Sullivan and Matea Gold report. Trump’s joint fundraising committee with the RNC, “Trump Victory,” has 21 finance events on the book for August alone. On Saturday, Trump is set to headline events in Nantucket and on Cape Cod, the latter of which will be held at the home of billionaire energy executive Bill Koch.  “The whirlwind-pace full calendar, coming during what is typically a relatively sleepy late summer period in the political world, highlights the urgency with which Republicans are trying to keep pace with [Clinton] in the money chase,” Sullivan and Gold add. “And it shows that there is a continuing appetite among party donors to back the billionaire real estate mogul, despite his stumbles on the campaign trail.” PROMINENT REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO DUMP TRUMP: -- Several Republicans are among a group of former cabinet officers, senior officials and career military officers who denounced Trump on Thursday, slamming his recent remarks on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia as “disgraceful.” “’These are disgraceful statements that betray our long-standing values and national interests embraced by presidents of both parties,’ said the letter, signed by former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former CIA director and defense secretary Leon Panetta. ‘We find Trump’s comments to be reckless, dangerous, and extremely unwise.’” “America needs a president who will strengthen our alliances,” it concludes, “not denigrate and destroy them.” (Anne Gearan) -- Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani says Trump should refrain from attacking McCain, Ayotte, Ryan, or the Khans: “If you shoot somebody in politics, they shoot back at you,” Giuliani said on Kilmeade and Friends. “My advice to Donald in private is the same as it is in public. Keep your eye on the ball and the ball is Hillary Clinton.” (Buzzfeed) -- New York Times, “Donald Tru mp Risks Alienating Military Communities in Swing States,” by Alexander Burns, Noah Remnick and Nick Corasaniti: “...he has also risked alienating an even more pivotal constituency in the swing states that will decide the presidential election: military communities dismayed by his crude and at times offensive comments about the armed services. These missteps threaten Mr. Trump in the heart of the electoral map. In several important states, his most realistic path to victory hinges on areas with close ties to the military, including northern Florida, coastal Virginia and New Hampshire, and a cluster of towns near military bases in North Carolina, Colorado and Arizona. Should even a segment of Republican-leaning military voters recoil from Mr. Trump, it could badly undermine him in states where he is already struggling because of his deep unpopularity with women and racial minorities …” -- The Harvard Republican Club announced it will NOT be backing Trump, urging voters to withdraw their support from the man they deigned a “threat to the survival of the Republic.” From the Harvard Crimson: ""His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy,"" read a statement from the group. ""He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House."" ...THE PUNDITS WEIGH IN, continuing to call into question Trump's SANITY: -- NYT’s David Brooks calls Trump a “political rampage, charging ever more wildly out of control:"" “With each passing week he displays the classic symptoms of medium-grade mania in more disturbing forms: inflated self-esteem, sleeplessness, impulsivity, aggression and a compulsion to offer advice on subjects he knows nothing about,"" Brooks writes. ""His speech patterns are like something straight out of a psychiatric textbook. As one trained psychiatrist said to me, compare Donald Trump’s speaking patterns to a Robin Williams monologue, but with insults instead of jokes ..."" But Brooks also warns Republicans who have sided with Trump that their positions are untenable and history will not regard them kindly: ""Events are going to force Republicans off the fence. For the past many months Republican leaders have been condemning Trump’s acts while sticking with Trump the man. Trump is making that position ridiculous and shameful. You either stand with a man whose very essence is an insult to basic decency, or you don’t. Those who don’t will have to start building a Republican Party in Exile. They will have to tell the country what they honestly think of Donald Trump. They will have to build a parallel campaign structure that will survive if Trump implodes, a structure of congressional and local candidates ... There comes a time when neutrality and laying low become dishonorable. If you’re not in revolt, you’re in cahoots. When this period and your name are mentioned, decades hence, your grandkids will look away in shame."" -- Trump’s attack on the Gold Star family was not a mistake, Charles Krauthammer writes: “It was a revelation. It’s that he can’t help himself. His governing rule in life is to strike back when attacked, disrespected or even slighted. To understand Trump, you have to grasp the General Theory: He judges every action, every pronouncement, every person by a single criterion — whether or not it/he is ‘nice’ to Trump. Treat him ‘unfairly’ and you will pay. House speaker, Gold Star mother, it matters not. I used to think Trump was an 11-year-old, an undeveloped schoolyard bully. I was off by about 10 years. His needs are more primitive, an infantile hunger for approval and praise, a craving that can never be satisfied. He lives in a cocoon of solipsism where the world outside himself has value — indeed exists — only insofar as it sustains and inflates him.” -- “Trump is many things, some of them dark and dangerous, but at his core, he is a B.S. artist,” Fareed Zakaria writes: “He boasts — and boasts and boasts — about his business, his buildings, his books, his wives. Much of it is a concoction of hyperbole and falsehoods. And when he’s found out, he’s like that guy we have all met at a bar who makes wild claims but when confronted with the truth, quickly responds, ‘I knew that!’ … As the crazy talk continues, standard rules of fact, truth and reality have disappeared in this campaign. Donald Trump has piled such vast quantities of his trademark product into the political arena that the stench is now overwhelming and unbearable.” THE DAILY HRC: -- “Clinton broadens campaign effort to target wary Republicans,” by Anne Gearan, Abby Phillip and John Wagner: “Clinton’s campaign is quietly broadening its outreach to potential Republican converts, including donors, elected officials, and business and foreign policy leaders. The message is simple: Even if you have never before considered voting for a Democrat, and even if you don’t like Clinton, choosing her this year is a moral and patriotic imperative. The recruitment is a continuation of the campaign’s efforts to sway influential Republicans and independents …” The recruitment appeal reportedly includes personal appeals by senior Democrats, including Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The campaign is also tracking Republicans who have spoken out against Trump in public."" -- Clinton’s campaign removed its state-specific ads in Virginia and Colorado, showing signs of confidence in both battleground states. From Abby Phillip: “According to a Democrat tracking media buys, the Clinton campaign has renewed its ad buys in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, and North Carolina. But it allowed its state-specific ads in Virginia and Colorado to lapse … The decisions come as a slew of new national and battleground state polls gives Clinton wide leads over [Trump].” Her super PAC also will not advertise in either state for the next two weeks. -- Tim Kaine defended Clinton on her private email server, saying he trusts that his running-mate is being honest when she answers questions about her email practices at the State Department. “Hillary and I have talked about this personally and we sat down within minutes after I was rolled out as her running mate to do a ‘60 Minutes’ interview and she said, 'I made a mistake. I screwed up and I learned something and I'll do it differently,” Kaine said on “CBS This Morning.” “That's been the way she's pitched it to me and I think that's the honest response and I've heard her say that a number of times."" -- New York Times, “With Billionaires Backing Her, Hillary Clinton Must Confront How to Deploy Them,” by Amy Chozick: “Now that Hillary Clinton has assembled a bipartisan cadre of billionaires to support her candidacy, how does she disperse the moneyed elite to help her in a campaign focused on income inequality? Warren E. Buffett … was easy. The low-key billionaire has been at the forefront of efforts to rewrite the tax code so that he does not pay a lower rate than his secretary. Meg Whitman, the technology executive and former Republican candidate for governor in California, said she would hold a fund-raiser to help elect Mrs. Clinton. Reed Hastings, the outspoken chief executive of Netflix, and Eric Schmidt, of Google fame, have both expressed support for Mrs. Clinton’s technology and business plans.” And Mark Cuban, the co-host of ABC’s entrepreneurial “Shark Tank,” hopes to focus on income inequality and a tax plan offering incentives for companies who share profits with employees."" WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: -- “Rio may be the glummest city ever to host the Summer Olympics,” by Joshua Partlow and Dom Phillips: “On Oct. 9, 2009, when the International Olympic Committee selected Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 Summer Games, confetti fell over a delirious crowd on Copacabana Beach … This was a country poised to knock on the First World’s door, an economic powerhouse with boundless natural wealth, the leader of a peaceful region  ...“[Now] … the mood is apprehensive, almost queasy. A recent poll found that nearly 2 out of 3 Brazilians expect the Olympics to bring more losses than benefits. Soldiers wearing camouflage are posted at bridges, subway platforms and beaches. ‘There was a moment of megalomaniacal euphoria,’ [said former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso]. ‘As if Brazil … already belonged in the First World. ‘Now we are in doubt: Are we really capable or not?’” --  An online petition is urging Khizr Khan, the father of an Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq, to run for Virginia legislature. From Jenna Portnoy: “In the week since Khizr Khan … made an impassioned call to elect Clinton, some of his supporters have found another person they’d like to see in public office: Khan. Thomas Keefe, a Vietnam veteran and longtime Democratic activist, watched the Khans from backstage at the convention and thought of his son’s friend who died while serving in Afghanistan … By the time Keefe, 67, had returned home to Knoxville, Tenn., he had resolved to send a message to Trump about the kind of leadership he believes Americans deserve. So he started a digital crowdfunding campaign intended to recruit Khan to run for the Virginia House of Delegates, complete with a bumper-sticker-ready slogan: ‘Yes We Khan!’ Through the platform Crowdpac, 123 individuals pledged more than $13,000 in less than two days. Keefe hopes to reach $20,000 by Monday …” (So far, Khan appears unlikely to take the bait – he declined comment Wednesday night, saying only “We are grateful for the pouring of love, support and respect.”) DISPATCHES FROM JANESVILLE...NEHLEN AS 'MINI-TRUMP:' -- Politico, “Mini-Trump goes after Ryan in his own backyard,” by Rachael Bade: “In an abandoned parking lot on the outskirts of Paul Ryan’s hometown, Paul Nehlen railed against what he called the House speaker’s ‘open borders policies; and claimed Ryan is ‘giving American jobs to foreigners.’ “I was on CNN last night and this morning! Lot of shows,’ the 47-year-old longtime factory manager exclaimed in Trump-like fashion to the small crowd. ‘It’s going to be full-court press.’ A yellow construction dump truck behind him was painted with, ‘Dump Paul Ryan’ and ‘Get the dirt on Ryan.’ It turns out that Ryan — who’s been plagued by Trump on Capitol Hill for the better part of a year — can’t even avoid the guy in his own backyard. Ryan may be one of the most popular figures in the Republican Party, but Nehlen, a remarkably well-financed gadfly running a mini-version of the real estate tycoon’s campaign, is forcing the House speaker and nine-term congressman to have to defend himself in a primary for the first time in years. Despite his obvious deficiencies (Ryan is expected to clobber him in the primary) Nehlen has seized on the same working-class discontent that Trump rode to the nomination, forcing Ryan to face down the GOP’s new, populist brand of Republicanism at home …” -- Ann Coulter is also planning to hit the campaign trail for Paul Nehlen: She is slated to appear alongside Nehlen at two televised rallies in the state, per a media advisory from the campaign.   -- “On the ground here in southeastern Wisconsin in a district dotted with factories and cornfields, there are few signs that the news media glow surrounding Mr. Nehlen has rubbed off on voters,” the New York Times reports. “This is one of those campaigns that looks big on social media and in certain conservative media, but when you get down on the ground in Racine, in Kenosha and Janesville, it’s just not there,” said Charlie Sykes, a conservative radio host who holds sway among Republicans here. “The grass-roots Republican activists are not divided on Paul Ryan.” SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: After a delay, Pence endorsed McCain and Ayotte's reelection bids.

0,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday backed away from earlier claims that he had seen video showing the United States delivering $400 million to the Iranian government, which he has repeated several times in recent days. Such a video does not appear to exist. “The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!” Trump tweeted Friday morning. Trump first made the claim that he had seen such footage of a ""top secret"" location on Wednesday, during a campaign event in Daytona Beach, Fla. His remarks on the issue came after the Wall Street Journal earlier this week reported the details of a $400 million payment the Obama administration sent to Iran in January, which it delivered in cash. The State Department had previously announced the payment — part of a $1.7 billion package settling a previous financial dispute — on the same day President Obama announced that Iran would release several American prisoners, which led many critics of the administration to suggest that the payment was effectively ransom. Obama and the State Department say that is a mischaracterization of the payment, and reiterated the U.S. policy against paying ransom. (Among the detainees released was Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian.) Trump's comments caused confusion and speculation about whether he might have seen such video footage during classified intelligence briefings, which are provided to the two presidential nominees. The intelligence briefings, however, have reportedly not yet begun. His spokeswoman said Wednesday night that Trump had mistaken a grainy video that has played repeatedly on Fox News for footage of a money transfer between the two governments in Iran. In fact, it showed the recently released American prisoners as they were arriving in Switzerland. But Trump repeated the claim Thursday during a campaign event in Portland, Maine, even after his spokeswoman had explained his error. “It was interesting because a tape was made. Right? You saw that?"" Trump said Thursday, echoing comments from the day before, during the campaign rally in Portland. ""With the airplane coming in — nice plane — and the airplane coming in, and the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us — has to be — by the Iranians. And you know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent. They want to embarrass our president.” ""I mean, who would ever think they would be taking all of this money off the plane and then providing us with a tape? It's only for one reason. And it's very, very sad,” he added. Obama’s critics quickly moved to use the Wall Street Journal's reporting to accuse the administration of paying ransom for hostages, a suggestion the president blasted Thursday during a news conference at the Pentagon. ""We announced these payments in January, many months ago. They weren't a secret. This wasn't some nefarious deal,"" Obama said. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trump’s running mate, echoed those attacks during an interview on NBC’s “TODAY” on Friday morning, accusing the administration of having “endangered the lives of every American on the world stage.” ""Most Americans are reeling this week with the news that the Obama administration delivered $400 million in cash to the mullahs in Iran on the very day that they released four hostages,” Pence said. “Now the president, Savannah, can say that that wasn’t a ransom payment, but the whole world knows that it was.” Pence also repeated Trump’s false claim that Hillary Clinton “actually initiated” the deal. While Clinton did in fact initiate negotiations with Iran related to its nuclear program, she did not participate in discussions related to releasing the American prisoners.","GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday backed away from earlier claims that he had seen video showing the United States delivering $400 million to the Iranian government, which he has repeated several times in recent days. Such a video does not appear to exist. “The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!” Trump tweeted Friday morning. Trump first made the claim that he had seen such footage of a ""top secret"" location on Wednesday, during a campaign event in Daytona Beach, Fla. His remarks on the issue came after the Wall Street Journal earlier this week reported the details of a $400 million payment the Obama administration sent to Iran in January, which it delivered in cash. The State Department had previously announced the payment — part of a $1.7 billion package settling a previous financial dispute — on the same day President Obama announced that Iran would release several American prisoners, which led many critics of the administration to suggest that the payment was effectively ransom. Obama and the State Department say that is a mischaracterization of the payment, and reiterated the U.S. policy against paying ransom. (Among the detainees released was Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian.) Trump's comments caused confusion and speculation about whether he might have seen such video footage during classified intelligence briefings, which are provided to the two presidential nominees. The intelligence briefings, however, have reportedly not yet begun. His spokeswoman said Wednesday night that Trump had mistaken a grainy video that has played repeatedly on Fox News for footage of a money transfer between the two governments in Iran. In fact, it showed the recently released American prisoners as they were arriving in Switzerland. But Trump repeated the claim Thursday during a campaign event in Portland, Maine, even after his spokeswoman had explained his error. “It was interesting because a tape was made. Right? You saw that?"" Trump said Thursday, echoing comments from the day before, during the campaign rally in Portland. ""With the airplane coming in — nice plane — and the airplane coming in, and the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us — has to be — by the Iranians. And you know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent. They want to embarrass our president.” ""I mean, who would ever think they would be taking all of this money off the plane and then providing us with a tape? It's only for one reason. And it's very, very sad,” he added. Obama’s critics quickly moved to use the Wall Street Journal's reporting to accuse the administration of paying ransom for hostages, a suggestion the president blasted Thursday during a news conference at the Pentagon. ""We announced these payments in January, many months ago. They weren't a secret. This wasn't some nefarious deal,"" Obama said. Indiana Gov.

0,"After two days of spouting inaccuracies about a nonexistent video of a $400 million cash transfer between the United States and Iran, Donald Trump did something rare on Friday morning: He acknowledged his mistake. Fair enough. It's good to be transparent. But Trump's admission came more than 24 hours after his campaign had already offered the same explanation. And in between those two events, Trump was on the campaign trail Thursday in Portland, Maine, offering the same imagined story. What's most amazing about all of it, though, is the detail with which Trump described the tape and its origins. He could be forgiven for misinterpreting some b-roll footage of a prisoner release that Fox News aired while talking about the money transfer -- which is indeed how it aired on Fox. But Trump in his brief comments both Wednesday and Thursday offered details and made several inferences about the tape that implied deep knowledge about something to which he clearly hadn't given much thought. And he stated many of these inferences as facts. He has played loose with the facts many times before, yes. But if you break down his comments in this case, it's pretty remarkable the number of things he simply invents as he goes along. He basically made up nine details about the video over the course of just 300 spoken words. (Indeed, that's why some posited that he might have been sharing information he received in a classified national security briefing.) Below, we break down both his comments Wednesday and Thursday, and what was wrong with them. WEDNESDAY IN DAYTONA BEACH, FLA. ""I got up this morning, and I pick up the papers and then I turn on the news and I see $400 million being shipped in cash, and it's being shipped overnight to Iran -- $400 million."" 1. The video footage of the prisoners being released was shot in Geneva, not Iran. 2. There is no cash visible, and the video wasn't of the cash transfer. ""I look, and I'll never forget the scene this morning."" 3. Trump says he'll never forget this scene he saw mere hours earlier, before he proceeds to misremember or invent several key details of it. At the least, he's overselling how closely he paid attention to it. ""And remember this: Iran -- I don't think you've heard this anywhere, but here -- Iran provided all of that footage, the tape, of taking that money off that airplane, right?"" 4. This claim is based on nothing besides Trump's incorrect inferences about the video he saw, and yet he states it as a fact. Given the scene was shot in Geneva -- as Trump now admits it was -- it's very unlikely the tape came from Iran. “$400 million in cash. How does the president do that? How do you do that? We're going to send $400 million in cash. This is in cash, in currency. Now, here's the amazing thing. Over there, where that plane landed -- top secret, they don’t have a lot of paparazzi, you know. The paparazzi doesn’t do so well over there, right?"" 5. The video is not top secret. And there is no indication that any news outlet presented it as such. Fox News, for instance, merely ran it as b-roll while talking about the $400 million transfer. ""And they have a perfect tape..."" 6. The tape is grainy and dark and shot from a distance. You definitely can't make out faces or really anything beyond that it's people getting off a plane. ""... done by obviously a government camera ..."" 7. Again, if Trump is referring to the Iranian government, it's not ""obvious"" that it's a government camera. It's not. ""... and the tape is of the people taking the money off the plane, right? That means that in order to embarrass us further, Iran sent us the tapes, right? It's a military tape. It's a tape that was a perfect angle, nice and steady. Nobody getting nervous because they're going to be shot because they're shooting a picture of money pouring off a plane."" 8. First it was a government camera. Then it was a military tape? Both wrong. THURSDAY IN PORTLAND, MAINE ""You know, it was interesting because a tape was made. Right? You saw that with the airplane coming in. Nice plane. And the airplane coming in. And the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us, has to be, by the Iranians."" Trump is downgrading his claims here, saying ""I guess"" it was money coming off the plane and that the footage ""has to be"" given to us by Iran. The day before, he stated these things as fact. But while he tempers his claims somewhat, by this point his campaign had already said he had mistakenly been talking about video not of cash transfer, but of the hostages in Geneva. Trump apparently didn't get the memo or decided to repeat these claims anyway. Given he's merely repeating previous claims, we won't count these as new ones. ""You know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president, because we have a president who's incompetent. They want to embarrass -- they want to embarrass our president."" 9.

0,"• This week may reveal more surprises, especially after a remarkable turn of events last week. With pockets of Republicans fleeing the party and Donald Trump’s poll numbers sinking, the GOP presidential nominee signaled a rare change of course not once, but twice. And Hillary Clinton continues to struggle with questions about the controversy surrounding her private email server while she was secretary of state. • Will Trump’s recent acquiescence to the party establishment bring those hesitant Republicans to his side? Despite his endorsement of House Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen. John McCain and Sen. Kelly Ayotte, that remains to be seen. And while things are looking good for Clinton, there’s still a lot of time left. Critics see her in a catch-22. The first female presidential nominee of a major party is being urged to give more news conferences and be less scripted. However, her responses to tough questions related to her private email server have not gone well. The Post fact-checked her last week and the missteps are leaving some of her supporters wondering what other bumps are in the road ahead. • Speaking of roads, Trump and Clinton clash over economic policy this week in the heart of the Motor City. Trump unveils his economic plan Monday in Detroit, while Clinton responds with her own proposals Thursday, a day after she reportedly attends a fundraiser in the Wolverine State. Both addresses are expected to offer differing visions “alongside questions about the other’s temperament and mental health,” The Post reports. Last week, Trump revealed his economic advisory team, which was noted for representing the “higher echelons of American finance.” • Protesters are hoping to #WallOffTrump at Detroit’s Cobo Center, where his economic speech will be delivered. A Facebook post by one group organizing the “wall” says it wants to “demonstrate what it means to reclaim our humanity.” The campaign changed venues last week, although reports conflict on whether that was due to scheduling or security concerns. • Meanwhile, Clinton will seek to undermine any support Trump has Monday and Tuesday in Florida. The state, which leans Democratic, is key in this year’s election, with 29 electoral votes. A pro-Trump super PAC begins running ads against Clinton the day she arrives. • On Tuesday, while Trump is in North Carolina, lots of eyes will be on the Wisconsin primary, in which Paul Ryan is expected to beat a relatively unknown rival named Paul Nehlen. Support for the speaker is strong, although last week The Post showed how advocates of “alt-conservatism” have taken the fight to his back yard. Ryan angered Trump supporters with his tepid endorsement of the nominee. • Running mates for both nominees zip across the country to either rally voters or raise money. Democrat Tim Kaine heads fundraisers Tuesday in Texas and Friday in New Hampshire. Polls show Trump has slipped in the Granite State, where he won his first primary earlier this year. The Virginia senator also attends a campaign event Saturday in Rhode Island. • Indiana GOP Gov. Mike Pence makes campaign stops Monday in Iowa and Tuesday in Pennsylvania. The governor also rallies Wednesday in Ohio, one day after Trump visits for a fundraiser. In these states, Pence may be a blessing for the campaign. “[P]utting a son of that region on the ticket should give Trump an effective messenger across that area,” says The Post’s Chris Cillizza. • Bill Clinton attends one fundraiser Friday and a doubleheader Saturday in California. The former president has been an effective surrogate for his wife’s campaign. And while “Bubba” woos donors on the West Coast, Trump is expected to attend a fundraiser on the East Coast in New York. The event is planned at the home of New York Jets owner Woody Johnson in the Hamptons. Johnson hosted a fundraiser for Trump earlier this year. The campaign’s July numbers were its strongest yet. “Poll finds Clinton has widened lead ahead of Trump to 8 points” by Dan Balz and Scott Clement • Former CIA Director Michael Morell not only said he would support Clinton but also raised eyebrows by suggesting Trump was aiding a foreign adversary. The “bromance” between the GOP nominee and Russian President Vladimir Putin has made news this campaign cycle. Speculation intensified after The Post’s Josh Rogin reported that Trump operatives urged changes in the Republican Party platform regarding the conflict in eastern Ukraine that favor Russia. “In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation,” Morell said. Ann Telnaes • The private email server scandal just won’t die for Clinton. She fumbled an answer on the server several times last week, first on “Fox News Sunday” then in follow-ups as late as Wednesday. Clinton mischaracterized the views expressed by FBI Director James Comey, who cleared her of criminal charges in the investigation of mishandling classified information on the server. But Comey did not absolve her of the contradictory statements she made to the public. Trump seized on her explanation that she somehow “short-circuited” her initial responses. • While President Obama addressed questions about whether a ransom was paid to Iran in exchange for the freeing of hostages (including The Post’s Jason Rezaian), Trump faced questions about his claims on the issue. The Republican nominee twice repeated a story to crowds about seeing a video showing cash being delivered to the Iranian regime. He finally admitted in a tweet later in the week that the images he saw were indeed not of cash, but of the hostages being released. As critics argued that Trump’s story once again shows a looseness with facts, some supporters weren’t pleased with the apparent buckle to pressure. In a final twist, Iran released video footage of a stack of euros, Swiss francs and other currencies handed over, apparently by the United States. Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Florida has 22 electoral votes. The state actually has 29 votes.","• This week may reveal more surprises, especially after a remarkable turn of events last week.

0,"Hi all. I'm Amber Phillips with The Fix, and I'll be guest hosting The Daily Trail this week and next. Trump had a lot to say today. A lot. More on that below...but first: the context.  With GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine announcing she's not voting for Donald Trump, and Trump appearing to encourage gun owners to take action if Hillary Clinton appoints anti-gun judges, the time has come to ask: Have we reached a turning point in Republicans' relationship with their nominee? Is this a moment we'll look back on as the beginning of the end for Trump's support in the party? My unsatisfying answer to that: It depends how you ask the question. Let's break it down into three categories to get a better sense of whether we are indeed in a turning point with Trump and the Republican Party. 1. How many Republicans are un-endorsing Trump? Depending on how you count their sometimes-vague answers, somewhere between 10 percent and 20 percent of Senate Republicans have said they won't support Donald Trump for president. A handful of House GOP lawmakers have said the same, and at least one said he's voting for Hillary Clinton. (Though Rep. Richard Hanna (N.Y.) is retiring.) Top Republican donors and figures past and present are endorsing Clinton on a near-daily basis now, and they add up to more than two dozen, by my colleague Aaron Blake's count. Two dozen-plus might sound like a lot, but that's nowhere near a majority of the Republican Party. In fact, in our latest Washington Post ABC News poll, 83 percent of Republican registered voters said they'll be voting for Trump over Clinton. But! Even this percentage of defections is historically unusual, said Robert David Johnson, a history professor at Brooklyn College. Cross-party endorsements are rare in modern-day politics, especially when they're coming from across party lines that are so ideologically divided. ""In a period where the parties are so ideologically grouped, having this many non-endorsements from legislators is almost inconceivable,"" he said. ""And so it does suggest there is something really, really unusual going on here."" 2. Why are they un-endorsing Trump? Then there's the motivation factor. When trying to assess whether the Republican Party is turning on its nominee, why people decide to speak out against him is a critical factor. It's also one that's tough to pin down without getting inside their heads. Are the Republican figures past and present coming out against Trump now doing so because he's suddenly proven himself an untenable candidate to them? Or are they simply voicing opposition they've held since the primaries? Or is there another, more personal motivation? To try to answer that last question, it's not difficult to see how un-endorsing Trump could actually benefit some Republican politicians in moderate states. A politician from a moderate state where Trump isn't that popular, like Collins, who's not up for reelection until 2020 (or, if she wants to run for governor of Maine, 2018), might be betting she has a much better chance of being reelected if Trump loses in November. Assuming future Trump is as unpopular as present Trump, we've already seen a glimpse of how Trump could drag down vulnerable Senate candidates in his party. Two recent polls showed Trump trailing by double digits in the swing states of Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, and the GOP Senate candidates there struggling in those polls, too.  My colleague James Hohmann noticed a trend about these un-endorsements that he wrote in his political newsletter, The Daily 202: ""Every Republican who has bucked Trump can be pretty easily categorized. A clear pattern emerges: The less directly and immediately accountable to Republican base voters an elected official is, the more likely he or she is to break with Trump."" It's also notable that some Republicans seem to be questioning Trump as the party is already locked into its nominee. Short of death, coma or Trump just deciding not to run, there's nothing in the rule books to keep him from staying Republican nominee in November. So what good can coming out against him in August do, other than hurt his chances and perhaps boost others? 3. Is this hurting Trump in the court of public opinion? Finally, we look at the publicity factor of this steady drip drip of Trump un-endorsements. And that's probably the most difficult to measure. Nearly every day, it feels like there's someone high profile expressing his or her displeasure with Trump. On Friday it was the former CIA director. Over the weekend it was a retiring Virginia congressman, who said he'd vote Libertarian. On Monday it was 50 former GOP national security officials. On Tuesday it was Collins (and a handful of former Bush administration officials). To anyone paying even the slightest attention to political news, it certainly feels like the party is abandoning Trump. That's not a good storyline for Trump to start the general election with. When he endorsed Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Trump signaled that party unity is indeed important to him (although he's also said he thinks he could win without it), These defections risk driving the narrative about Trump that he's unfit to be president. But how much of this is internal party politics that is merely background noise to the rest of voting America? Does the average voter know or even care who Michael Chertoff or William Reilly or even Collins -- the most prominent un-Trump supporter so far -- is? And once they find out, will it affect how they vote? That's the million dollar question. Besides, if you're to believe Trump himself, all press is good press. By that definition Trump has the full attention of the Republican Party and the American public. And by that logic he is winning, not losing. By most standard measures, he is not. I personally think it's less clear whether the Republican Party has reached a turning point with its nominee, but the fact we're talking about this at all is a significant political moment. Other top developments If you can't watch the video right now: here's what Trump has to say in the clip. The Secret Service said they're ""aware"" of Trump's comments. Team Clinton's response to his comment was swift and clear: ""What Trump is saying is dangerous."" Trump's response: It's the media's fault. THE VIEW FROM THE FIELD: YOUR DAILY TRAIL PIT STOP: What he said.","Hi all. I'm Amber Phillips with The Fix, and I'll be guest hosting The Daily Trail this week and next.

When trying to assess whether the Republican Party is turning on its nominee, why people decide to speak out against him is a critical factor. It's also one that's tough to pin down without getting inside their heads. Are the Republican figures past and present coming out against Trump now doing so because he's suddenly proven himself an untenable candidate to them? Or are they simply voicing opposition they've held since the primaries? Or is there another, more personal motivation? To try to answer that last question, it's not difficult to see how un-endorsing Trump could actually benefit some Republican politicians in moderate states. A politician from a moderate state where Trump isn't that popular, like Collins, who's not up for reelection until 2020 (or, if she wants to run for governor of Maine, 2018), might be betting she has a much better chance of being reelected if Trump loses in November. Assuming future Trump is as unpopular as present Trump, we've already seen a glimpse of how Trump could drag down vulnerable Senate candidates in his party. Two recent polls showed Trump trailing by double digits in the swing states of Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, and the GOP Senate candidates there struggling in those polls, too.  My colleague James Hohmann noticed a trend about these un-endorsements that he wrote in his political newsletter, The Daily 202: ""Every Republican who has bucked Trump can be pretty easily categorized. A clear pattern emerges: The less directly and immediately accountable to Republican base voters an elected official is, the more likely he or she is to break with Trump."" It's also notable that some Republicans seem to be questioning Trump as the party is already locked into its nominee. Short of death, coma or Trump just deciding not to run, there's nothing in the rule books to keep him from staying Republican nominee in November. So what good can coming out against him in August do, other than hurt his chances and perhaps boost others? 3. Is this hurting Trump in the court of public opinion? Finally, we look at the publicity factor of this steady drip drip of Trump un-endorsements. And that's probably the most difficult to measure. Nearly every day, it feels like there's someone high profile expressing his or her displeasure with Trump. On Friday it was the former CIA director. Over the weekend it was a retiring Virginia congressman, who said he'd vote Libertarian. On Monday it was 50 former GOP national security officials. On Tuesday it was Collins (and a handful of former Bush administration officials). To anyone paying even the slightest attention to political news, it certainly feels like the party is abandoning Trump. That's not a good storyline for Trump to start the general election with. When he endorsed Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Trump signaled that party unity is indeed important to him (although he's also said he thinks he could win without it), These defections risk driving the narrative about Trump that he's unfit to be president. But how much of this is internal party politics that is merely background noise to the rest of voting America? Does the average voter know or even care who Michael Chertoff or William Reilly or even Collins -- the most prominent un-Trump supporter so far -- is? And once they find out, will it affect how they vote? That's the million dollar question. Besides, if you're to believe Trump himself, all press is good press. By that definition Trump has the full attention of the Republican Party and the American public. And by that logic he is winning, not losing. By most standard measures, he is not. I personally think it's less clear whether the Republican Party has reached a turning point with its nominee, but the fact we're talking about this at all is a significant political moment. Other top developments If you can't watch the video right now: here's what Trump has to say in the clip. The Secret Service said they're ""aware"" of Trump's comments. Team Clinton's response to his comment was swift and clear: ""What Trump is saying is dangerous."" Trump's response: It's the media's fault. THE VIEW FROM THE FIELD: YOUR DAILY TRAIL PIT STOP: What he said."
0,"Congressional Republicans want to censure the Obama administration for sending $400 million in “ransom” to Iran on the same day as American prisoners were released – an issue they bet will play big on the campaign trail two months before election day. The move comes as new details are emerging about just how and when the Obama administration completed the transfer of $1.7 billion to settle claims related to the incomplete sale of military weapons before the Iranian Revolution in 1979. According to two congressional aides, Treasury officials said in a Tuesday congressional briefing that after the U.S. made a $400 million cash payment to Iran on Jan. 16 coinciding with the release of four American prisoners, it also paid out the remaining $1.3 billion of interest in cash, in two tranches on Jan. 22 and Feb. 5. Treasury Department spokesperson Dawn Selak said Tuesday that the payments, “made in non-U.S. currency, in cash,” were necessary because of how successful sanctions have been at isolating Iran from the international financial system over the last several years. According to Treasury officials, the U.S. did not make the cash payments directly to Iran, though the department would not identify international intermediaries. Republicans have charged that the initial $400 million was nothing more than a “ransom” payment as it coincided with the release of the prisoners, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. They say the new revelations about the administration’s interest payments are more of the same. “What’s worse than a $400 million cash ransom to Iran? A $1.7 billion cash ransom to Iran,” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) said in a statement late Tuesday. “This cash bonanza has emboldened Iran’s radical regime, and undermined America’s national security.” House GOP leaders are putting a new Iran measure from Royce to prevent such cash payments at the top of their to-do list during the four weeks they are back in session before the November election, with a vote expected in the full House this month. State Department officials have denied Republican charges that the $400 million  was “ransom,” describing it instead as “leverage” to ensure the Americans were released. But defining the payment to Iran as “ransom” is one issue on which House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Donald Trump agree. Ryan said in a statement last month that the payment marked “another chapter in the ongoing saga of misleading the American people to sell this dangerous nuclear deal.” The GOP presidential nominee memorably claimed that he had seen a grainy video footage of the $400 million in cash being delivered to Iran — he later clarified that the footage he was referring to was of the prisoners on a plane in Geneva, Switzerland. The GOP nominee continued to slam Obama on the subject, however, accusing him of lying about the payment’s purpose. Republican leaders are coalescing behind a bill Royce introduced Tuesday to censure the Obama administration for the $400 million “ransom,” prohibit any more cash payments from being made to Iran and to ensure that in the future, Congress gets a heads up before any future settlement deals are enacted. “The Obama administration forked over a massive cash ransom to Iran, emboldening the world’s leading state sponsor of terror and putting more lives at risk,” Royce said in a statement announcing the new legislation. “All of this was done in secret, hidden from the American people and from Congress.  This bill will ensure it doesn’t happen again.” Royce’s bill comes out the same day as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) introduced Republican-backed legislation to stop all future payments to Iran from a fund to pay judgments and settlements against the federal government until Tehran returns the “ransom money”  and instead settles claims from American victims of Iranian terrorism. Democrats do not appear to be on board with either measure. There are no Democratic co-sponsors on the Rubio-Pompeo legislation, and a spokesman for House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday afternoon that Democrats could not comment on legislation they were reviewing. The payments to Iran were announced in January alongside the official implementation of the Iran nuclear deal. Republicans have strongly opposed the multilateral pact since it was struck last summer, though they were unsuccessful in blocking its implementation. But the GOP has leapt on the $400 million payment as the latest objectionable piece of the Obama administration’s dealings with Iran. GOP leaders in Congress and on the campaign trail first speculated that the settlement of Iran’s long-running claim for the  might be a “ransom” when the administration announced it on the same day as the release of American prisoners last January. Both things happened on the day of implementation of the Iran nuclear deal. The settlement was intended to resolve a dispute before an international tribunal at The Hague over funds Iran paid decades ago to buy weapons from the United States, the sales of which was suspended after Iran’s 1979 revolution broke out. When it emerged last month that the administration had delayed the $400 million cash payment to coincide with the date of the prisoners’ release, Republicans doubled down on their “ransom” charges. Since the nuclear deal was announced, lawmakers have launched several attempts to push back against it — releasing legislation to sanction Iran over its ballistic missile tests, human rights abuses, and support for terrorism. But Royce has been especially concerned with the matter of cash payments being made to Iran, warning last spring that “Iran’s supreme leader must not be allowed to seek ‘death to America’ with U.S. dollars in his pocket.” His new bill seeks to ensure that the United States “may not provide, directly or indirectly,” any cash from the U.S. or a foreign government to Iran. It also requires the president to submit a report to Congress every six months detailing what claims before The Hague tribunal are outstanding, in what amounts, and when the administration expects they will be resolved.” “The huge concern here is that it’s all about the cash,” a congressional aide said of Royce Tuesday. “It’s about the dollars.” But Democrats say cash payments to Iran are necessary because sanctions have effectively cut Iran out of the international banking system, and thus should not cause so much concern. “They can’t deal in banking, because banks won’t deal with Iran,” Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Tuesday when asked if cash payments were a concern. “The fact that it’s in cash is somewhat not typical, and it does not look good, but my understanding is that Iran has not been able to establish banking, international banking and that’s part of our strategy.

The 254 to 163 vote, which fell nearly along party lines, comes as lawmakers are making a final push toward the campaign trail, where Republicans bet their wholesale rejection of President Obama’s deals with Iran will play big with voters. Thursday’s measure is just the latest in a series of steps Republican House leaders have taken to decry the administration’s pursuit of the multilateral nuclear deal with Iran their members opposed, as well as the circumstances surrounding its implementation. Lately, the GOP has focused on a $400 million cash payment the United States sent to Iran on the same day in January that the deal was implemented and several American prisoners, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, were released. The money was to settle Iran’s claim before an international tribunal that the United States owed it $400 million, plus interest, in funds set aside to pay for military weapons that were never delivered following the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Earlier this month, administration officials said in a closed-door congressional briefing that they had also paid $1.3 billion of interest in two additional cash tranches sent to Iran on Jan. 22 and Feb. 5, according to aides present. Republican leaders in Congress and on the campaign trail — including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump — have seized on the simultaneous timing of the $400 million payment and the release of prisoners, arguing that makes it clear that the cash payments were a “ransom.” State Department officials insist the payments were delayed to ensure they would have “leverage” to secure the release of the prisoners. The House-passed measure is a continuation of that fight. It would prohibit the United States from paying Iran cash of any kind going forward, and states that it is U.S. policy “not to pay ransom or release prisoners” to secure the release of Americans abroad. It also requires that the administration give Congress at least 30 days’ advance notice before conducting any transactions to settle other claims before the international tribunal set up to resolve disputes between Iran and the United States. As part of that notice, the bill requires that the administration provide a justification for any payments and certify that they do not constitute “ransom.” The measure also instructs the administration to advise and update Congress on the list of outstanding claims before the tribunal. The administration has already threatened to veto the measure. In their explanation of the threat, administration officials argued that the measure would effectively make it impossible to settle any outstanding claims with Iran. Congressional Democrats have also insisted that the administration had to send Tehran cash payments because strict sanctions against Iran made it functionally impossible to use the traditional banking system. Republicans have pushed back at that reasoning, arguing the administration relied on wire transfers to purchase heavy water from Iran as part of a deal announced in the spring.","The House passed a bill Thursday to outlaw cash payments to Iran, in a rebuke of the Obama administration’s decision to send Tehran what Republicans charge was “ransom” on the same day American prisoners were released.

When it became too difficult to rest, prison officials gave him tranquilizers so he could fall asleep. These are among the harrowing details that have been revealed in a lawsuit filed Monday by the Rezaian family against Iran and the Revolutionary Guard. The lawsuit states Rezaian, as well as his wife, mother and brother, suffered irreparable harm as a result of torture, hostage-taking and acts of terrorism. Excerpts in the lawsuit paint a grim picture of the family while Rezaian was in jail. The suit reveals both Rezaian’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and his brother, Ali Rezaian, contemplated suicide to raise more public outrage for his cause and Iran’s actions, and that the family continues to fear backlash from the Iranian government. Below are some of the most harrowing details from the lawsuit: 1.  Iranian agents first confronted Rezaian and Salehi at their apartment building on July 22, 2014, keeping them at their apartment as agents rifled through their belongings. 2. Rezaian and his wife were  taken to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison. They were promptly separated and interrogated. Rezaian was placed in solitary confinement. 3. Prison guards denied Rezaian sleep, and he slept on the floor. 4.  Rezaian changed cells only after 50 days in solitary confinement, but he was still kept isolated. 5. Rezaian was routinely denied any medical care for his high blood pressure. He rapidly lost about 50 pounds as a result of stress and malnourishment, and he developed intestinal issues. 6. Rezaian's interrogators questioned him for hours while he was blindfolded and changed their tactics to force a confession. 7. Iranian officials recorded Rezaian, hoping to create a legal basis for his imprisonment at the General Assembly. 8. Rezaian's wife was allowed to see him only three times during her imprisonment, which was almost all in solitary confinement. 9. Yeganeh often faced psychological torment. She was denied water for almost the entire day and was repeatedly threatened.  10. Iranian law requires the trial date to be set at least 12 days beforehand. But that wasn't the case for Jason, whose counsel was often left in the dark about his trial dates and verdicts.  Read more: Jason Rezaian’s wife, mother describe their tortuous final hours in Iran Freeing a reporter: Secret diplomatic talks and private back channels Plane leaves Iran with Post reporter, other Americans in swap","For months while he was jailed in Iran’s most notorious prison, Jason Rezaian slept on a cold, roach-infested floor.

And when it was all over, dejected fans who stuck around for the high-stakes ending streamed out of Nationals Park to face an (almost) equally depressing reality: There was no Metro. The transit agency’s relationship with the Washington-area baseball community took a real hit this month, as Nats players, game-goers and politicians expressed outrage that Metro’s general manager, Paul J. Wiedefeld, refused to cut back on nighttime maintenance work to provide after-hours train service from the stadium. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) called the decision “wrongheaded”; outfielder Bryce Harper told fans to forget Metro and take an Uber. But on Thursday night, the tension between Metro and fans reached peak vitriol. When an announcement came over the loudspeakers at about 10:50 p.m. alerting fans about when the last train departing Navy Yard station would be, the crowd booed and erupted into chants: “METRO SUCKS! METRO SUCKS!” But despite fears that the stadium would empty prematurely as fans fled to the train station, that didn’t happen. Near midnight, the stadium remained packed with loyal fans who refused to abandon the Nats. But their enthusiasm couldn’t save the Nationals from a 4-3 loss. And once things went south, some fans started seeing a connection between their heartbreaking loss and Metro’s perpetual struggles. The one bright spot? SafeTrack is scheduled to end by next summer … just in time for the 2017 baseball season.","For D.C. loyalists, two bad things happened Thursday night.

0,"Update: Trump doubled down on this assertion in a tweet Sunday morning, suggesting he'll keep pressing on this going forward. The below was posted Friday. Donald Trump offered a new justification on Friday for attacking Bill Clinton's indiscretions and Hillary Clinton's handling of them: Michelle Obama did it first. Here's what Trump said in Fletcher, N.C.: “And I see how [President Obama's] wife likes Hillary, but wasn’t she the one that originally started the statement, ‘If you can’t take care of your home,’ right, ‘you can’t take care of the White House or the country?’ Where's that? I don’t hear that. I don’t hear that. She’s the one that started it.” Trump then offered this as a justification for invoking the Clintons' personal problems. “I said, ‘We can’t say that. It’s too vicious.’ Can you believe it? I said that — ‘We can’t say that.’ They said, ‘Well, Michelle Obama said it.’ I said, ‘She did?’ ” Well, not exactly — or, at least, not as Trump presented it. The fact is that the 2007 Michelle Obama statement Trump is referring to wasn't so clearly the dig at the Clintons that Trump would lead you to believe. The remark in question came during an August 2007 event at which Michelle Obama spoke in Chicago. Trump gets the quote pretty close to accurate, but not quite. “One of the things — the important aspects of this race — is role modeling what good families should look like,” Obama said at the time. “And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. Can't do it.” She repeated the comment at a rally a few days later in Iowa, adding: “So we've adjusted our schedules to make sure that our girls are first, so while he's traveling around, I do day trips. That means I get up in the morning, I get the girls ready, I get them off, I go and do trips, I'm home before bedtime.” Some reporting around the time did interpret this as a possible dig at the Clintons, and the Drudge Report took it from there, blaring the headline “Obama Wife Slams Hillary.” But President Obama denied at the time that the comment had anything to do with the Clintons. Instead, he said it was about the Bush administration. “There was no reference beyond her point that we have had an administration that talks a lot about family values but doesn’t follow through,” Obama said. Look, it's certainly possible that Michelle Obama was taking a veiled shot at the Clintons' rocky personal lives and providing her own family as a more attractive contrast to it. Politicians do this kind of thing so that they will have plausible deniability, but the media will still write about it as if it were an attack. And the first lady has certainly shown an ability to attack Donald Trump, routinely doing it without referring to him by name. But her attacks are otherwise pretty obviously about him, and the Obama campaign in the 2008 primary didn't really trot her out regularly to issue these kinds of veiled — or even direct — attacks. That wasn't her strength as a surrogate. What's more, her extended comments at the Iowa rally suggest she was talking about how their family handles the campaign. And she spoke repeatedly on the campaign trail about how she wanted to maintain some kind of normalcy for their family, even as her husband was in the midst of a meteoric political rise. So this wasn't a one-off for her. It was a subject she spoke about frequently. Her husband's explanation of her comments strikes us as kind of odd. It's apparent how it could have been intended for the Clintons, but it's not really clear what specific aspect of the Bush administration's policies she might have been attacking when she talked about her family's travel schedule and taking care of their home. The Bush family was, by all accounts, a pretty solid family unit. And why did it have to be a veiled reference at all? What's clear beyond all of this, though, is that even if Michelle Obama was digging at the Clintons, this attack was not anything close to a feature of the 2008 campaign, as it has become in the 2016 Trump vs. Clinton race. And politically speaking, it's a questionable decision too. When it comes to political figures in the United States, few are even close to Michelle Obama's popularity. A Bloomberg poll this week showed 62 percent of Americans have a favorable view of her. Are swing voters who like her really going to believe she was getting down in the mud and attacking the Clintons nine years ago when her family denied it? It seems unlikely. Trump likes to blame others for starting his more controversial lines of attack — even blaming Hillary Clinton for starting the birther conspiracy theory. But yet again, he's using very scant evidence and making a strained argument to avert the gaze from his own bare knuckles.","Update: Trump doubled down on this assertion in a tweet Sunday morning, suggesting he'll keep pressing on this going forward.

0,"President Trump on Thursday intensified his criticism of the decision to commute the sentence of military leaker Chelsea Manning, calling her a “traitor” who should remain in prison. In a tweet, Trump claimed Manning had called former president Barack Obama a “weak leader” even after her 35-year sentence was commuted in the last days of the Obama administration. Trump appeared to be referring to a column that Manning wrote in the Guardian newspaper. In the commentary, she argued that Obama's legacy will leave “few permanent accomplishments” because he often sought common ground and compromise rather than battling harder against “unparalleled resistance from his opponents.” Manning wrote: “What we need is an unapologetic progressive leader.” The use of the word “traitor” is often tossed around by political leaders and others to describe alleged acts that threaten national security. But it is rare for a president to brand someone as a traitor, and Trump's comment raised questions about whether he could try to bring further action against Manning, who is scheduled to be released in May. “Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible!” Trump wrote. Last week, days before being named White House spokesman, Sean Spicer said Trump was “troubled” by Obama’s commutation of the sentence of Manning, an Army private convicted of taking troves of secret diplomatic and military documents and disclosing them to WikiLeaks. “It’s disappointing, and it sends a very troubling message when it comes to the handling of classified information and to the consequences of those who leak information that threatens the security of our nation,” Spicer told reporters. Spicer called Manning “someone who has given away this country’s secrets,” but he did not directly answer a question about whether Trump would take any steps to reverse or delay Obama’s decision. Obama said that the seven years Manning has served behind bars amounted to enough punishment and that she had been given an excessive sentence. Manning, then known as Bradley Manning, was arrested in Iraq in May 2010 after trasmitting documents to WikiLeaks that came to be known as the Iraq and Afghanistan “War Logs.” Manning also shared a video that showed a U.S. Apache helicopter in Baghdad opening fire on a group of people that the crew believed to be insurgents. Among the dead were two journalists who worked for the Reuters news agency. Manning also leaked documents pertaining to Guantanamo Bay prisoners, as well as 250,000 State Department cables. Manning came out as transgender after her conviction.","President Trump on Thursday intensified his criticism of the decision to commute the sentence of military leaker Chelsea Manning, calling her a “traitor” who should remain in prison.

0,"THE MORNING PLUM: President Trump’s immigration ban faces a crucial legal test later Tuesday, when an appeals court is set to hold a hearing to decide whether to lift a lower court’s decision to place a hold on it. Judging by his multiple tweets attacking the judiciary for placing a temporary hold on his ban, Trump is trying to pressure the courts into restoring and upholding it, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for possible defeat by explicitly stating that any terrorist attacks that happen later should be blamed on the judges who rule against it. But it’s important to step back and appreciate the bigger picture here. Trump — faced with an outpouring of popular opposition to his ban, and a level of institutional pushback to it, that surely caught him and his advisers off guard — is actively experimenting with how far he can go in delegitimizing the institutions that are already signaling they may place serious, meaningful limits on his power. Consider: The travel ban has unleashed a surprisingly robust response from the public and our institutions, making this into a first test case as to whether popular mobilization and those institutions can effectively rein in Trump’s authoritarian and nakedly discriminatory impulses. The question is not just whether this ban can be stopped. It’s also whether Trump can be blocked from extending and expanding this policy and instituting others like it. But even as that response has arisen, Trump is also testing how far he can go in delegitimizing our institutions — and in telling lies designed to minimize impressions of popular opposition to the scope and nature of his exercise of power — apparently in order to undermine the degree to which those forces will continue to function as a check on that power later. So it’s important to appreciate that this test case flows in two directions. ***************************************************************** * FATE OF TRAVEL BAN RESTS WITH APPEALS COURT: Trump’s travel ban will get a hearing in a federal appeals court later Tuesday, and The Post overview of the situation notes: The future of the temporary ban now lies with three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit: William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Carter; Judge Richard Clifton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush; and Judge Michelle Taryn Friedland, who was appointed by President Obama. Whatever decision is reached may be appealed to the Supreme Court, but the court only has eight members and might deadlock, in which case the appeals court ruling would stand. * A KEY CONCESSION ABOUT THE BAN? Adam Liptak observes this about the administration’s latest brief defending it: [The brief] asked the appeals court, at a minimum, to reinstate at least part of Mr. Trump’s order — appearing to acknowledge the possibility that the government’s case might not be successful. “At most,” the brief said, the court order blocking the ban should be limited to “previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.” The administration hopes that at least some of the travel ban can remain in place — keeping out those who have not ever visited the United States — while the underlying legal dispute is resolved. Small victories! * HOMELAND SECURITY CHIEF TO BE GRILLED ON BAN: The Los Angeles Times notes that John Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, is set to face tough questioning from lawmakers Tuesday about Trump’s immigration ban: Kelly will be in the awkward position of defending the execution of a directive he didn’t see until the week it was issued and wasn’t told was coming until the day before it was signed. Here’s a question for Kelly: Do you disagree with all of the national security professionals who believe this ban makes us less safe by sending a message that the United States is at war with Islam? * TRUMP IS PUTTING TRAVEL BAN IN LEGAL JEOPARDY: David George explains that the travel ban’s legal fate will turn on how expansively the courts interpret presidential power, but with a twist: Typically, legal experts say, the president would almost certainly win a legal fight involving national security and foreign citizens entering the country. But the rollout of this executive order has been far from the norm. Trump’s campaign promise to impose a Muslim ban, his recent tweets attacking the GOP-appointed judge who ruled against him and the White House’s clumsy handling of the order’s implementation may change the calculation. It would be a fitting end to this saga if Trump’s anti-Muslim demagoguery and assaults on the judiciary, and Bannon’s incompetent rollout of the ban, ended up dooming it. * SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON TRUMP’S BAN: The White House likes to say that the seven countries targeted by Trump’s ban were merely selected from a list of countries that the Obama administration was worried about, as evidenced by Obama’s signing of a bill that restricted a visa program involving those countries. But Glenn Kessler has a detailed look at the actual history here, and it shows that the story is much more complicated than the White House claims. Here are the crucial points: The Obama administration’s measure did not ban people from visiting, and its emphasis was on people who traveled to those seven countries, while Trump is banning them, and his emphasis is on people who are nationals of those countries. Gosh, whatever would motivate Trump’s decision to make this all about nationality? * ANGRY CROWDS PROTEST OBAMACARE REPEAL: The New York Times reports that Republicans are increasingly anxious about their strategy for repealing Obamacare, and are now opting for a go-slow approach: Many are facing tough, angry questions at town hall meetings. … A crowd of protesters gathered outside a town meeting in California held over the weekend by Representative Tom McClintock, who was escorted by police officers as he left the event, 
according to news reports. Representative Gus Bilirakis of Florida faced 200 angry supporters of the health care law at a meeting on Saturday.

Bush ethics chief Richard Painter puts it: “There has never been a first lady of the United States who insinuated that she intended to make a lot of money because of the ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ opportunity of being first lady.” This White House is unconventional and disruptive! * AND THE TRUMP TWEET OF THE DAY, IT’S-STILL-ABOUT-OBAMA EDITION: Good morning, Mr. President: Actually, the parties to the Iran deal also include Britain, France, Germany, China and (wait for it) Russia.","THE MORNING PLUM: President Trump’s immigration ban faces a crucial legal test later Tuesday, when an appeals court is set to hold a hearing to decide whether to lift a lower court’s decision to place a hold on it. Judging by his multiple tweets attacking the judiciary for placing a temporary hold on his ban, Trump is trying to pressure the courts into restoring and upholding it, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for possible defeat by explicitly stating that any terrorist attacks that happen later should be blamed on the judges who rule against it. But it’s important to step back and appreciate the bigger picture here. Trump — faced with an outpouring of popular opposition to his ban, and a level of institutional pushback to it, that surely caught him and his advisers off guard — is actively experimenting with how far he can go in delegitimizing the institutions that are already signaling they may place serious, meaningful limits on his power. Consider: The travel ban has unleashed a surprisingly robust response from the public and our institutions, making this into a first test case as to whether popular mobilization and those institutions can effectively rein in Trump’s authoritarian and nakedly discriminatory impulses. The question is not just whether this ban can be stopped. It’s also whether Trump can be blocked from extending and expanding this policy and instituting others like it. But even as that response has arisen, Trump is also testing how far he can go in delegitimizing our institutions — and in telling lies designed to minimize impressions of popular opposition to the scope and nature of his exercise of power — apparently in order to undermine the degree to which those forces will continue to function as a check on that power later. So it’s important to appreciate that this test case flows in two directions. ***************************************************************** * FATE OF TRAVEL BAN RESTS WITH APPEALS COURT: Trump’s travel ban will get a hearing in a federal appeals court later Tuesday, and The Post overview of the situation notes: The future of the temporary ban now lies with three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit: William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Carter; Judge Richard Clifton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush; and Judge Michelle Taryn Friedland, who was appointed by President Obama. Whatever decision is reached may be appealed to the Supreme Court, but the court only has eight members and might deadlock, in which case the appeals court ruling would stand. * A KEY CONCESSION ABOUT THE BAN? Adam Liptak observes this about the administration’s latest brief defending it: [The brief] asked the appeals court, at a minimum, to reinstate at least part of Mr. Trump’s order — appearing to acknowledge the possibility that the government’s case might not be successful. “At most,” the brief said, the court order blocking the ban should be limited to “previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.” The administration hopes that at least some of the travel ban can remain in place — keeping out those who have not ever visited the United States — while the underlying legal dispute is resolved. Small victories! * HOMELAND SECURITY CHIEF TO BE GRILLED ON BAN: The Los Angeles Times notes that John Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, is set to face tough questioning from lawmakers Tuesday about Trump’s immigration ban: Kelly will be in the awkward position of defending the execution of a directive he didn’t see until the week it was issued and wasn’t told was coming until the day before it was signed. Here’s a question for Kelly: Do you disagree with all of the national security professionals who believe this ban makes us less safe by sending a message that the United States is at war with Islam? * TRUMP IS PUTTING TRAVEL BAN IN LEGAL JEOPARDY: David George explains that the travel ban’s legal fate will turn on how expansively the courts interpret presidential power, but with a twist: Typically, legal experts say, the president would almost certainly win a legal fight involving national security and foreign citizens entering the country. But the rollout of this executive order has been far from the norm. Trump’s campaign promise to impose a Muslim ban, his recent tweets attacking the GOP-appointed judge who ruled against him and the White House’s clumsy handling of the order’s implementation may change the calculation. It would be a fitting end to this saga if Trump’s anti-Muslim demagoguery and assaults on the judiciary, and Bannon’s incompetent rollout of the ban, ended up dooming it. * SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON TRUMP’S BAN: The White House likes to say that the seven countries targeted by Trump’s ban were merely selected from a list of countries that the Obama administration was worried about, as evidenced by Obama’s signing of a bill that restricted a visa program involving those countries. But Glenn Kessler has a detailed look at the actual history here, and it shows that the story is much more complicated than the White House claims. Here are the crucial points: The Obama administration’s measure did not ban people from visiting, and its emphasis was on people who traveled to those seven countries, while Trump is banning them, and his emphasis is on people who are nationals of those countries. Gosh, whatever would motivate Trump’s decision to make this all about nationality? * ANGRY CROWDS PROTEST OBAMACARE REPEAL: The New York Times reports that Republicans are increasingly anxious about their strategy for repealing Obamacare, and are now opting for a go-slow approach: Many are facing tough, angry questions at town hall meetings. … A crowd of protesters gathered outside a town meeting in California held over the weekend by Representative Tom McClintock, who was escorted by police officers as he left the event,

1,"I sat in the gallery above the floor of the House of Representatives on Tuesday night surrounded by a broad cross-section of American society that had gathered to witness the national institution known as the State of the Union, or the Address to a Joint Session of Congress as it is known during a new president’s first year in office. From my seat among the guests, I could glimpse at least eight women wearing the Islamic hijab, including Aneelah Afzali, a lawyer and the director of the American Muslim Empowerment Network, who wore a scarf with the American flag on it. I could see Mona Hanna-Attisha, an Iraqi American who uncovered the lead in water crisis in Flint, Mich., and José Andrés, the Spanish-born chef who is being sued by President Trump after pulling out of plans to open a restaurant at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Around me, too, were plenty of Republican supporters of the new administration; Layton Ricks, the president of Livingston Parish in Louisiana, was seated next to me. All had been invited for a particular reason by a politician in the room. And as the main chamber of Congress began to fill, marking the start of the night’s pageantry, I felt very aware of the strange circumstances that had brought me to this moment. At the last State of the Union, President Barack Obama’s eighth and final one, some people in this chamber had worn pins with “#freejason” written on them. My fate had become a public issue in the contentious political struggle over the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran and its controversial policy of engaging longtime adversaries. I had also become a symbol of the dangers faced by journalists around the world and the ongoing international struggle for press freedoms. My brother, Ali, an invited guest of my hometown congressman, Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), was somewhere in that crowd, still lobbying tirelessly for my freedom. And I was thousands of miles away, watching the address unfold in radically different surroundings: inside a high-walled compound deep within Tehran’s Evin prison. Watching Obama in Tehran As The Washington Post’s correspondent in Tehran, I had been locked up for nearly 540 days at that point, detained on fabricated charges of espionage and “collaborating with hostile governments.” Since the moment my journalist wife and I were arrested in July 2014, there had been persistent calls for our release from a broad spectrum of leaders and influential figures in the United States and abroad. Throughout the ordeal I was denied all my most basic rights: due process, access to legal representation, the opportunity to prepare a defense, bail. But although I was kept isolated from the general population of inmates — and the rest of the world — throughout my time in Evin, by January 2016 I had access to a television and someone to watch it with me. The small, flat-screen panel was encased in a white wooden frame high on one of the walls. It received only the range of state-controlled channels and their heavily censored programming, and often I saw myself being slandered by Iranian officials and their propagandists. Yet the TV also gave me a window into what was happening in my home country. It may seem odd that Iran, a declared enemy of the United States, would permit an American prisoner to watch the State of the Union. The annual address allows our president a unique opportunity to cast the United States in the best possible light, shaping viewers’ ideas around the world about what America can and should be, according to that administration’s agenda. But the Islamic Republic’s state television covers American politics more closely — one might say religiously — than almost any other subject, and will often air live speeches by our presidents. American news, in fact, is an essential ingredient of the propaganda the regime creates to fortify its anti-Americanism. So there I sat before dawn on the morning of Jan. 13 with my cellmate from a former Soviet republic, who spoke almost no English, but, like so many people around the world, had a fondness for the 44th president of the United States. Whenever Obama appeared on the small screen, he would put his hand to his chest and say “my friend” in Farsi. I had found in years past that Obama could be counted on during the State of the Union to fulfill his role of inspiring hope that the country was on the right track. But that day in my Iranian prison cell, I watched as he foreshadowed our growing domestic identity crisis. “When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesn’t make us safer,” he said. “That’s not telling it like it is; it’s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals.” I knew that he was almost certainly referring to an incident several days earlier when a Muslim American named Rose Hamid was emphatically removed from a Trump campaign rally in South Carolina. All she had done was wear a T-shirt that read, “Salam, I come in peace.” I knew this, even imprisoned, because Iran’s state television — like American cable news networks — had been giving incredible amounts of airtime to the American politician most likely to bash Islam, thus reinforcing Tehran’s narrative of America as being the “Great Satan.” I listened closely to see whether Obama would mention me and the other Americans imprisoned in Iran. But he instead struck an optimistic chord. “We built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile and the world has avoided another war,” Obama said in his only reference to the Islamic Republic. Although not mentioned in the speech, we had not been forgotten. Four days later, the other American prisoners and I were free. We were released on the same day that the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and world powers was implemented, but as we learned later, negotiations to release us in exchange for freeing Iranians imprisoned in America had been going on for over a year. Huffman joined me, my wife, Yeganeh, Ali and my mother in Landstuhl, Germany, where two other Americans and I underwent post-release medical tests before flying back to the States. Huffman then invited Yeganeh and me to be his guests at the next State of the Union and we accepted with enthusiasm. We could not have imagined at the time that Donald Trump would be the one giving the address, and that his message would be so vastly different from Obama’s. Reasons for hope I was pondering the epic turn of events for me, and for this country, when I entered the House chamber on Tuesday night. But those thoughts dissipated when Trump began his speech. At times, he spoke in tones that often did not reflect the actions of his first weeks in office, adding to what was already a jarring experience for me. “Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world,” Trump said. But then I would hear again the strains that reminded me of so many speeches delivered by authoritarian leaders. “The chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again,” Trump said. Like much of the American public, I had come to view Trump as a reactionary, and reactionary rhetoric provokes responses from other reactionaries. This is not a new dance, but the tempo is reaching new speeds, as leaders with no personal filters are taking to social media along with everyone else. But Trump isn’t the only leader with a Twitter account, and right now in Tehran, and other capitals, anti-American leaders are licking their lips. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has one, too, and he has been using it to share his assessment of the White House’s newest occupant. “We appreciate Trump! Because he largely did the job for us in revealing true face of America,” Khamenei tweeted on Feb. 7 on the heels of the executive order temporarily banning arrivals from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran. Since Yeganeh and I moved back to the United States, we have been welcomed by almost everyone we have encountered. But for us, along with millions of others in America, that feeling of security and belonging was rattled with Trump’s travel ban. Then, earlier this month, Trump called another group that both my wife and I belong to “the enemy of the American people.” It was not some fringe opposition party he was referring to, but journalists, a community that she and I are proud to count ourselves among. So in a plot twist worthy of fiction, we are now living in a situation in the United States with discomfiting parallels to our imprisonment in Iran, where we were condemned for practicing journalism and our ties to America. Yeganeh is a native of Iran who has recently come to a country that is showing increasing hostility to immigrants — especially those from Iran. And I am an American foreign correspondent whose profession is being slandered by some in my own country as un-American. Like many Americans, I am apprehensive about Trump’s proposals, especially for residents of minority backgrounds and for journalists and our ability to do this job unimpeded by the state. Given his harsh words, my concerns feel justified. Yet I remain fundamentally optimistic. I have lived and worked in an authoritarian country and have experienced firsthand what it means to be stripped of my liberties. The moment we are living through, alarming as it is, does not compare. Trump and his administration may not properly value the ideals enshrined in our Constitution. But I believe the people of this country will not give them away easily. I am heartened as I observe so many other Americans, in Congress on Tuesday night for Trump’s address and around the country, refusing to accept this twisted vision of our future. And I have so much more hope today than I did in early 2016. That is because I am here now, a free man in a free country, able to again use the tools of my trade to join in protecting and upholding the “liberty and justice for all” that we as Americans so rightly cherish.","I sat in the gallery above the floor of the House of Representatives on Tuesday night surrounded by a broad cross-section of American society that had gathered to witness the national institution known as the State of the Union, or the Address to a Joint Session of Congress as it is known during a new president’s first year in office.

0,"It’s been more than a month since our last roundup of what the president got wrong on Twitter in a given week, an occasional Friday series at The Fact Checker. President Trump has been tweeting less frequently, and his tweets have become more ceremonial — simply sharing photos or videos of memorable events or commemorating a holiday. But in the past week, Trump tweeted misleading or false claims about several issues that were worth delving into. Here’s a look at what Trump got wrong in 10 tweets since last Friday. This is an obvious flip-flop for Trump. Why would he call China a currency manipulator? Well, for starters, he made a campaign promise that he would direct the Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator. Throughout the campaign, Trump falsely blamed China for being a “world champion” of devaluing the yuan. We rated that outdated claim Four Pinocchios: Not only is the United States not being hurt by China’s current currency manipulation, China also is not devaluing its currency anymore. In fact, China is selling foreign currency to prop up its own in an effort to prevent the yuan from depreciating further and destabilizing the Chinese and global economy. Then, on April 12,  Trump announced that he would not label China a currency manipulator, breaking his key economic campaign promise. We rated this promise “Broken” in our Trump Promise Tracker. We’ll first note these two things have nothing to do with each other. Trump repeatedly said he would release his federal tax returns once they are done being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Nothing in law prohibits him from releasing his taxes while under audit. In fact, the first president to release his taxes, Richard M. Nixon, did so in the middle of an audit. He said in interviews about releasing his tax returns: “I have no problem and it should be and I hope it’s before the election.” (Here’s Fact Checker’s look at what we know about his taxes so far.) In any case, he’s incorrect that winning the electoral college was an “impossible thing to do for a Republican” and his electoral college votes were not “easily won.” According to a tally by John Pitney of Claremont McKenna College, Trump ranked 46th out of 58 electoral college results. (More on that here.) Pitney’s list also shows every Republican president since Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 won a larger share of the electoral college votes than Trump, with the exception of George W. Bush (twice) and Nixon in 1968. Trump keeps touting his successes in his first 90 days, but we’ve found the evidence sorely lacking. As we’ve written, few presidents achieve much on foreign policy matters in their first 100 days in office, as such policy advancements take time. Trump, so far, has been meeting with many foreign heads of state, but it’s too early to say whether his policies will result in real changes. Trump tweeted several times leading up to and on the day of the April 18 special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price, now the secretary of health and human services. Trump is referring to Jon Ossoff, who is headed to a runoff election with Republican Karen Handel. He did not accurately describe Ossoff’s stances on illegal immigration and taxes, as our friends at PolitiFact and FactCheck.org found. Ossoff supports a comprehensive immigration bill that allows a “path to legal status” for undocumented people (excluding felons) living in the country. But he also said he supports strong border security. This is not the same as “allowing illegal immigration.” On taxes, FactCheck.org found that Ossoff has proposed to simplify the tax code and that “to lower tax rates, we can eliminate carve-outs and special treatment in the tax code that privilege large organizations at the expense of small businesses.” This is not correct. The MS-13 gang, or Mara Salvatrucha, has been operating and expanding for two decades preceding former president Barack Obama’s term. MS-13 is believed to have started in Los Angeles in the 1980s by Salvadorans who immigrated there to flee civil war in their country, according to the Congressional Research Service. As of 2005, the gang had traveled to many cities across the country, from California to the East Coast.  PolitiFact and FactCheck.org dug into this in depth. Moreover, Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump is arresting an increasing number of noncriminals, indicating that it’s not just the criminal and dangerous gang members who are being targeted by his administration. The day after the Georgia special election, Trump took credit for the ensuing runoff election. He said he was “glad to be of help,” even though Republicans in the race distanced themselves from him as the election got closer. And while Republicans avoided an embarrassing loss, it wasn’t exactly a BIG “R” win that Handel will face Ossoff in the runoff. Ossoff garnered 48 percent of the vote in a strong Republican district, just shy of the 50 percent needed for an outright win. Many pundits said the result indicated danger signs for Republican lawmakers in the Trump era. Trump now calls for Americans to “buy American, hire American.” But this is misleading. Trump had a long history of outsourcing a variety of his products and has acknowledged doing so. When asked during a Republican primary debate in Miami why voters should trust that Trump “will run the country differently from how you run your businesses,” he answered: “Because nobody knows the system better than me. … I’m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We’re allowed to do it. … I’m the one that knows how to change it.” During the campaign, The Fact Checker counted a total of 12 countries where Trump products were manufactured (China, the Netherlands, Mexico, India, Turkey, Slovenia, Honduras, Germany, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea).   (About our rating scale)   Send us facts to check by filling out this form Keep tabs on Trump’s promises with our Trump Promise Tracker Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter   Share the Facts 2017-04-21 10:50:35 UTC

","It’s been more than a month since our last roundup of what the president got wrong on Twitter in a given week, an occasional Friday series at The Fact Checker. President Trump has been tweeting less frequently, and his tweets have become more ceremonial — simply sharing photos or videos of memorable events or commemorating a holiday. But in the past week, Trump tweeted misleading or false claims about several issues that were worth delving into. Here’s a look at what Trump got wrong in 10 tweets since last Friday. This is an obvious flip-flop for Trump. Why would he call China a currency manipulator? Well, for starters, he made a campaign promise that he would direct the Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator. Throughout the campaign, Trump falsely blamed China for being a “world champion” of devaluing the yuan. We rated that outdated claim Four Pinocchios: Not only is the United States not being hurt by China’s current currency manipulation, China also is not devaluing its currency anymore. In fact, China is selling foreign currency to prop up its own in an effort to prevent the yuan from depreciating further and destabilizing the Chinese and global economy. Then, on April 12,  Trump announced that he would not label China a currency manipulator, breaking his key economic campaign promise. We rated this promise “Broken” in our Trump Promise Tracker. We’ll first note these two things have nothing to do with each other. Trump repeatedly said he would release his federal tax returns once they are done being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Nothing in law prohibits him from releasing his taxes while under audit. In fact, the first president to release his taxes, Richard M. Nixon, did so in the middle of an audit. He said in interviews about releasing his tax returns: “I have no problem and it should be and I hope it’s before the election.” (Here’s Fact Checker’s look at what we know about his taxes so far.) In any case, he’s incorrect that winning the electoral college was an “impossible thing to do for a Republican” and his electoral college votes were not “easily won.” According to a tally by John Pitney of Claremont McKenna College, Trump ranked 46th out of 58 electoral college results. (More on that here.) Pitney’s list also shows every Republican president since Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 won a larger share of the electoral college votes than Trump, with the exception of George W. Bush (twice) and Nixon in 1968. Trump keeps touting his successes in his first 90 days, but we’ve found the evidence sorely lacking. As we’ve written, few presidents achieve much on foreign policy matters in their first 100 days in office, as such policy advancements take time. Trump, so far, has been meeting with many foreign heads of state, but it’s too early to say whether his policies will result in real changes. Trump tweeted several times leading up to and on the day of the April 18 special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price, now the secretary of health and human services. Trump is referring to Jon Ossoff, who is headed to a runoff election with Republican Karen Handel. He did not accurately describe Ossoff’s stances on illegal immigration and taxes, as our friends at PolitiFact and FactCheck.org found. Ossoff supports a comprehensive immigration bill that allows a “path to legal status” for undocumented people (excluding felons) living in the country. But he also said he supports strong border security. This is not the same as “allowing illegal immigration.” On taxes, FactCheck.org found that Ossoff has proposed to simplify the tax code and that “to lower tax rates, we can eliminate carve-outs and special treatment in the tax code that privilege large organizations at the expense of small businesses.” This is not correct. The MS-13 gang, or Mara Salvatrucha, has been operating and expanding for two decades preceding former president Barack Obama’s term. MS-13 is believed to have started in Los Angeles in the 1980s by Salvadorans who immigrated there to flee civil war in their country, according to the Congressional Research Service. As of 2005, the gang had traveled to many cities across the country, from California to the East Coast.  PolitiFact and FactCheck.org dug into this in depth. Moreover, Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump is arresting an increasing number of noncriminals, indicating that it’s not just the criminal and dangerous gang members who are being targeted by his administration. The day after the Georgia special election, Trump took credit for the ensuing runoff election. He said he was “glad to be of help,” even though Republicans in the race distanced themselves from him as the election got closer. And while Republicans avoided an embarrassing loss, it wasn’t exactly a BIG “R” win that Handel will face Ossoff in the runoff. Ossoff garnered 48 percent of the vote in a strong Republican district, just shy of the 50 percent needed for an outright win. Many pundits said the result indicated danger signs for Republican lawmakers in the Trump era. Trump now calls for Americans to “buy American, hire American.” But this is misleading. Trump had a long history of outsourcing a variety of his products and has acknowledged doing so. When asked during a Republican primary debate in Miami why voters should trust that Trump “will run the country differently from how you run your businesses,” he answered: “Because nobody knows the system better than me. … I’m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We’re allowed to do it. … I’m the one that knows how to change it.” During the campaign, The Fact Checker counted a total of 12 countries where Trump products were manufactured (China, the Netherlands, Mexico, India, Turkey, Slovenia, Honduras, Germany, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea).   (About our rating scale)   Send us facts to check by filling out this form Keep tabs on Trump’s promises with our Trump Promise Tracker Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter   Share the Facts 2017-04-21 10:50:35 UTC

0,"The Post reports: Visitors from six predominantly Muslim nations will be denied visas to the United States under new guidelines that take effect Thursday night unless they can prove very close family ties to someone already in the country or an institution such as a workplace or university. The rules sent to diplomatic posts worldwide Wednesday prompted immediate criticism for the narrow and somewhat quirky definition of close family. A son-in-law or a step-daughter can get in, but a grandmother or uncle cannot. Senior administration officials said they drew up the list of close relationships based on the definition of family in the Immigration and Nationality Act passed almost 50 years ago. You might chalk this up to mindless bureaucratic rulemaking (not so different than picking the seven countries in the first Muslim ban because they were lumped together in the Obama administration — for an entirely different purpose). You might conclude that the Trump people, to borrow a term, are just plain “mean.” A grandmother who helped raise you is dying but you can’t go visit her? Pshaw, say the Trumpkins. You lived with your aunt and uncle when your parents were deployed overseas and now can’t go to their wedding anniversary party? Too bad! You might instead reach the conclusion that there is nothing more important to the Trump crowd than throwing red meat to the base, which often entails demonizing and persecuting minorities. These are not mutually exclusive explanations. Can one imagine what the values-voter crowd would have said had President Barack Obama promulgated some such rule? They’d scream that he was attacking family voters and lacked an appreciation of the importance of extended family. They’d point out that this is what happens when a big, coldhearted bureaucracy starts meddling in people’s lives for spurious reasons. Now, they say nothing. Republicans have long claimed the value of “freedom.” Freedom not to buy health care. Freedom not to pay much in taxes. Freedom to run your business as one sees fit. (But of course these can become nonsensical in the real world — the freedom to lose Medicaid; the freedom to live in a country that passes on debt because it won’t pay for services it demands; and the freedom to pollute. Really, people, that’s your ideal?) Ironically, the whole Muslim-ban farce — and we know it’s a farce because we have passed the time necessary to develop extreme vetting, the stated excuse for the ban — tramples on two fundamental rights. Republicans used to understand that freedom of religious expression protected all faiths. Republicans used to believe that freedom to travel — which is inseparable from the right to make your life as you see fit — is essential. Now they are in the business of deciding what “real” family is and which life events one can miss. (It’s only Grandpa’s funeral!?) This is big government run amok. The family-values crowd is mute, leaving it to civil liberties and immigration groups to stand up for families. The Post reported: “Defining close family to exclude grandparents, cousins, and other relatives defies common sense,” said Johnathan Smith, legal director of Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group that plans to send monitors to Dulles International Airport on Thursday night. Cornell University Law School professor Stephen Yale-Loehr, who has written volumes of legal books on immigration law, said the travel ban would have barred many refugees who came to the United States years ago and have caused no problems. Among them are the Lost Boys of Sudan and children orphaned by famine and war. “Similarly, why can a stepsister visit the United States but not a grandmother?” he asked. “The State Department should vet visa applicants on a case-by-case basis for terrorism concerns, not impose overly broad categories that prevent innocent people from coming to this country.” … Amnesty International called on Congress to overturn the travel ban and said it will dispatch monitors to airports to observe whether anyone is denied entry. “Separating families based on these definitions is simply heartless,” Naureen Shah, director of campaigns for Amnesty International USA, said in a statement. “It further proves the callous and discriminatory nature of Trump’s Muslim ban.” The GOP and its evangelical conservative helpmates could learn a thing or two about family by listening to these groups.","The Post reports: Visitors from six predominantly Muslim nations will be denied visas to the United States under new guidelines that take effect Thursday night unless they can prove very close family ties to someone already in the country or an institution such as a workplace or university.

0,"Visitors to the Chargers’ official website are presented with the phrase, “Fight for LA.” While presumably intended in a figurative sense as the team prepares for its first season in Los Angeles, that fight began in earnest Wednesday, with brawls breaking out between the Chargers and Rams during a joint practice. The practice was held at the Rams’ training facility at UC Irvine, and it featured at least three fights. The first fracas saw Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson throwing a punch at the head of Chargers wide receiver Dontrelle Inman. Another Rams cornerback, Nickell Robey-Coleman, shoved Inman down, at which point Keenan Allen threw Robey-Coleman to the ground. Players from both teams rushed over to jaw at each other, with Chargers running back Melvin Gordon later saying, “Your brother’s going to war, you’ve got to be there to back him up.” “He probably landed a punch on my helmet, which is kind of nothing. I think that’s stupid,” Inman said of Johnson to the Los Angeles Times. “If you break your hand, then what?” Shortly after that, Rams cornerback E.J. Gaines and Chargers wide receiver Jamaal Jones got into it, causing teammates to converge on the melee and throw more punches. Robey-Coleman and Gaines were involved in another fight, this one involving Chargers defensive end Chris McCain during a special-teams drill. Chargers Coach Anthony Lynn decided that was enough, and he yanked McCain off the field. “At some point, you have to make an example out of somebody,” Lynn said. “We weren’t gonna fight all day.” “I’ve been a part of something like this when we practiced against the Texans in Washington,” said Rams Coach Sean McVay, a former assistant with the Redskins (via ESPN). “Fortunately nobody got hurt as a result of it. We’ll try to be mindful of those things moving forward.” The teams had practiced together last week with little of Wednesday’s unpleasantness, and they will play a preseason game later this month. In a few years, they will be co-tenants at a stadium being built by Rams owner Stan Kroenke, one that lured the Chargers north after 55 years in San Diego. Although the Chargers played their inaugural season in Los Angeles, they have none of the built-in Los Angeles fan base enjoyed by the Rams, who played in the city from 1946 to 1994 before moving to St. Louis and returning last year. The sense that the Chargers need to battle for attention and loyalty in their new home is behind their “Fight for LA” slogan, videos for which have been tweeted out by players. “I think we’ve built a nice little rivalry against the Rams,” Gordon said. “That’s kind of what I got out of today.” Read more about the NFL: NFL to hire full-time officials in move to improve quality of in-game calls Robert Kraft recalls Vince Wilfork’s heartfelt relationship with his late wife at retirement ceremony ‘We are where we are’: Colts seem unconcerned about injured Andrew Luck’s timetable From rampant injuries to Kaepernick drama, it’s been an eventful training camp for Ravens","Visitors to the Chargers’ official website are presented with the phrase, “Fight for LA.” While presumably intended in a figurative sense as the team prepares for its first season in Los Angeles, that fight began in earnest Wednesday, with brawls breaking out between the Chargers and Rams during a joint practice.

0,"Update: In February, we compiled this history of Trump claiming to have met Putin. We can now add a new item to the list. In a Feb. 7 tweet, President Trump repeated his claim that he doesn’t “know Putin,” an argument he’s made ever since closeness to Russia and its president became a political liability. Back when knowing world leaders was an asset, though, Trump bragged about a relationship with Putin. Below, a brief chronology of Trump’s claims. June 2013: “Will he become my new best friend?” Trump’s nonexistent relationship with Putin began with a simple query on Twitter, as the businessman prepared to bring his Miss Universe pageant to Moscow. Trump has tweeted about Putin 66 times. November 2013: “I do have a relationship” As the pageant approached, MSNBC’s Thomas Roberts — who hosted it — sat down to interview Trump. He asked about Trump’s relationship with Putin. “I do have a relationship and I can tell you that he’s very interested in what we’re doing here today. He’s probably very interested in what you and I are saying today, and I’m sure he’s going to be seeing it in some form.” March 2014: “Putin even sent me a present” Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump told the audience that he’d interacted with Putin’s team when he was in Moscow. BuzzFeed News found the video: “You know, I was in Moscow a couple months ago, I own the Miss Universe pageant, and they treated me so great. Putin even sent me a present, beautiful present, with a beautiful note. I spoke to all of his people. And, you know, you look at what he’s doing with President Obama. He’s, like, toying with him. He’s toying with him.” May 2014: “I spoke … with President Putin” Speaking at the National Press Club, Trump again raised the Miss Universe pageant — this time inflating his burgeoning friendship with the Russian president. “I was in Russia, I was in Moscow recently. And I spoke indirectly — and directly — with President Putin, who could not have been nicer.” November 2015: “I got to know him very well” Asked what Trump would do to confront Russian aggression, Trump first downplayed Russia’s role, noting that there were issues with other countries, too. Then he described knowing Putin — because he and the Russian leader had both been on the same episode of “60 Minutes.” “But, as far as the Ukraine is concerned, and you could Syria — as far as Syria, I like — if Putin wants to go in, and I got to know him very well because we were both on ‘60 Minutes,’ we were stablemates, and we did very well that night. But, you know that.” As Time magazine later explained, Trump and Putin never met during the taping of the show. Trump was interviewed in New York and Putin in Moscow. July 2016: “I don’t know who Putin is” As the general election heated up, new attention was paid to Trump’s relationship with Putin, prompted both by allegations of Russian hacking that aided Trump and his former campaign manager’s ties to the Russian government. During his last news conference before the election, Trump was asked about a relationship with Putin. “I never met Putin, I don’t know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I’m a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.” (Putin did not call Trump a genius.) Trump continued. “I have nothing to do with Putin. I’ve never spoken to him. I don’t know anything about him other than he will respect me.” This was the news conference where Trump encouraged Russia to release emails hacked from Hillary Clinton’s private server. July 2016: “I have no relationship with him” Trump was asked about his relationship with Putin in more detail a few days later during an appearance on ABC’s “This Week.” HOST GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: What exactly is your relationship with Vladimir Putin? TRUMP: I have no relationship to — with him. I have no relationship with him. STEPHANOPOULOS: But if you have no relationship with Putin, then why did you say in 2013, I do have a relationship. In 2014, I spoke … TRUMP: Because he has said nice things about me over the years. When Trump mentioned the “60 Minutes” appearance, Stephanopoulos noted that they couldn’t have actually met. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yet you said for three years, ’13, ’14 and ’15, that you did have a relationship with him. TRUMP: No, look, what — what do you call a relationship? I mean he treats me … STEPHANOPOULOS: I’m asking you. TRUMP: — with great respect. I have no relationship with Putin. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. I never met him. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. STEPHANOPOULOS: You would know it if you did. TRUMP: I think so. Stephanopoulos pressed the point. STEPHANOPOULOS: But I just want to clear this up, because you did say on three different occasions you had a relationship with him. Now you say there is none. TRUMP: Well, I don’t know what it means by having a relationship. I mean he was saying very good things about me, but I don’t have a relationship with him. I didn’t meet him. I haven’t spent time with him. I didn’t have dinner with him. I didn’t go hiking with him. October 2016: “I don’t know Putin.” During the second presidential debate, Clinton accused Trump of having benefited from Russian interference in the election — a charge which metastasized after Election Day. Trump denied it. “I don’t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don’t know Putin.” He went on to add that “anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are — she doesn’t know if it’s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking.” February 2017: “I don’t know Putin” On Tuesday, Trump repeated his recent claim. But this one we know is not true. Last month, Trump and Putin spoke on the phone, as part of Donald Trump’s new job responsibilities. In 2013 and 2014, a relationship with Putin gave Trump gravitas and standing. In 2016, it became a liability. At this moment, it’s still politically preferable for Trump to keep his distance — even as that distance has vanished. We can say one thing, though. When it comes to meeting world leaders, the presidency is more effective than running the Miss Universe pageant. Update: July 2017: “It’s an honor to be with you” At long last, Trump and Putin meet face-to-face. The end.","Update: In February, we compiled this history of Trump claiming to have met Putin. We can now add a new item to the list.

But, you know that.” As Time magazine later explained, Trump and Putin never met during the taping of the show. Trump was interviewed in New York and Putin in Moscow. July 2016: “I don’t know who Putin is” As the general election heated up, new attention was paid to Trump’s relationship with Putin, prompted both by allegations of Russian hacking that aided Trump and his former campaign manager’s ties to the Russian government. During his last news conference before the election, Trump was asked about a relationship with Putin. “I never met Putin, I don’t know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I’m a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.” (Putin did not call Trump a genius.) Trump continued. “I have nothing to do with Putin. I’ve never spoken to him. I don’t know anything about him other than he will respect me.” This was the news conference where Trump encouraged Russia to release emails hacked from Hillary Clinton’s private server. July 2016: “I have no relationship with him” Trump was asked about his relationship with Putin in more detail a few days later during an appearance on ABC’s “This Week.” HOST GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: What exactly is your relationship with Vladimir Putin? TRUMP: I have no relationship to — with him. I have no relationship with him. STEPHANOPOULOS: But if you have no relationship with Putin, then why did you say in 2013, I do have a relationship. In 2014, I spoke … TRUMP: Because he has said nice things about me over the years. When Trump mentioned the “60 Minutes” appearance, Stephanopoulos noted that they couldn’t have actually met. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yet you said for three years, ’13, ’14 and ’15, that you did have a relationship with him. TRUMP: No, look, what — what do you call a relationship? I mean he treats me … STEPHANOPOULOS: I’m asking you. TRUMP: — with great respect. I have no relationship with Putin. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. I never met him. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. STEPHANOPOULOS: You would know it if you did. TRUMP: I think so. Stephanopoulos pressed the point. STEPHANOPOULOS: But I just want to clear this up, because you did say on three different occasions you had a relationship with him. Now you say there is none. TRUMP: Well, I don’t know what it means by having a relationship. I mean he was saying very good things about me, but I don’t have a relationship with him. I didn’t meet him. I haven’t spent time with him. I didn’t have dinner with him. I didn’t go hiking with him. October 2016: “I don’t know Putin.” During the second presidential debate, Clinton accused Trump of having benefited from Russian interference in the election — a charge which metastasized after Election Day. Trump denied it. “I don’t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don’t know Putin.” He went on to add that “anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are — she doesn’t know if it’s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking.” February 2017: “I don’t know Putin” On Tuesday, Trump repeated his recent claim. But this one we know is not true. Last month, Trump and Putin spoke on the phone, as part of Donald Trump’s new job responsibilities. In 2013 and 2014, a relationship with Putin gave Trump gravitas and standing. In 2016, it became a liability. At this moment, it’s still politically preferable for Trump to keep his distance — even as that distance has vanished. We can say one thing, though. When it comes to meeting world leaders, the presidency is more effective than running the Miss Universe pageant. Update: July 2017: “It’s an honor to be with you” At long last, Trump and Putin meet face-to-face. The end."
0,"TEHRAN — Thirty-five years after the founding of its Islamic republic, Iran is in the midst of a transformative period, with signs that its relations with the United States are warming in a way that was hardly imaginable when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned here from exile in February 1979. On Tuesday, the Islamic state is expected to mark its anniversary, as it does every year, with massive public rallies and speeches from top officials. But the speech by President Hassan Rouhani is likely to carry a starkly different tone from the defiant addresses delivered by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during his eight years as president. “Regardless of how good or bad Ahmadinejad was, I think the fact that he's no longer president, in itself, has eased a lot of tension,” Mohammad Marandi, a professor at Tehran University’s Institute for North American and European Studies, said of the former president, who infuriated the West with his controversial and often inflammatory comments. It’s not that the tough rhetoric has disappeared. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in an address Saturday to Iranian air force commanders that the U.S. government was “lying” about not seeking regime change in the country. “If they had the ability” to remove Iran’s top leaders, “they would not hesitate for a second,” Khamenei said. But Khamenei has approved a less combative approach to the West, especially in negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program. That is fueling hope here that Iran can win a lifting of tough international sanctions, the root of its economic woes. On Sunday, Iran agreed to provide information and explanations to the International Atomic Energy Agency, specifically regarding the development of detonators that are often associated with weapons programs. The move is seen as a confidence-building measure going into fresh rounds of negotiations that are slated to start this month in Vienna. Iran’s shift in international diplomacy has generated the strongest consensus within its political establishment in many years and follows a prolonged period of bitter infighting during Ahmadinejad’s second term — between his allies who preferred populist policies and those who saw such policies as a threat to clerical rule. Iran has other differences with world powers, notably over its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country’s civil war. And Rouhani still faces domestic hurdles in implementing his economic policies and his administration’s outreach to world powers. Many Iranians are unconvinced that the theocracy can evolve in ways that will improve their lives. Domestically, Rouhani’s government is focusing on righting Iran’s wobbly economy, hobbled by high unemployment and by inflation that in January hovered near 40 percent. The president has not answered calls from many Iranians for expanded civil liberties and social reforms. On Iran’s nuclear dispute with the West, Rouhani enjoys the support of Khamenei, who has given the president a free hand in negotiations with world powers. Khamenei accepted a more flexible approach when Rouhani entered office, allowing Iran’s nuclear negotiating team to broker an interim deal with world powers that eased some sanctions in exchange for Iran curbing its most controversial uranium-­enrichment activities. Iran contends that its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes, although Western leaders worry that Tehran may be developing a weapons capability. Khamenei called the decision to negotiate without the resistance that had been a hallmark of Iran’s nuclear strategy during Ahmadinejad’s presidency an act of “heroic flexibility.” That phrase was “intended to relay the message that Iran’s top leadership in general, and the leader in particular, should not be viewed as a stumbling block to negotiations and peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue,” said Farideh Farhi, a U.S.-based Iran analyst. Iran is unlikely to abandon its new strategy, experts said, given the Iranian public’s heightened expectations of an easing of sanctions and a corresponding improvement in the economy. “Tehran is in it for the long haul, because they need the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,” said Suzanne Maloney, a senior research fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. Not since the 1989-97 presidency of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a close ally of Rouhani’s, has Iran enjoyed the sort of consensus it does right now between religious conservatives and more pragmatic politicians. One sign that the government is trying to reconcile its internal division came last week when opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi was transferred from a state residence to his own home. Karroubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi were losing candidates in the disputed 2009 election and led the months-long protest movement that followed. Both have been under house arrest since 2011. “The Islamic republic is in the most unified state that it has been in over two decades. Right now the extremes in all parties and factions have been largely discredited. The center in general is stronger, and those on the periphery have been weakened,” Marandi said. Still, although many Iranians seem to approve of Rouhani’s pragmatic approach, his government is not producing the kind of social change that many citizens had hoped to see. Those expecting a return to a more open society, of the type ushered in with the election of Mohammad Khatami in 1997, have been disappointed by the slow progress of domestic change. Rouhani exerted a lot of effort to court the supporters of the stalled reform movement that preceded Ahmadinejad. But despite early attempts to promote greater personal liberties for Iranian citizens, including promises to reduce Internet censorship and support a freer environment on university campuses, long-standing restrictions persist. The number of executions in Iran remains among the highest in the world, the fate of university students who were expelled for political activities during the Ahmadinejad presidency is still undecided, and no discernible progress has been made on reducing Internet censorship. “Rouhani is first and foremost a pragmatist, and where domestic reforms serve his purposes, he will press for them. But this is very different than the kind of philosophical commitment to civil society and rule of law that Khatami demonstrated,” Maloney said. Domestic issues may become more pressing in the coming months, especially if a final nuclear agreement is reached. For the time being, however, it appears that Iran’s government has calculated that addressing foreign policy issues outweighs implementing the liberalizing reforms that many Iranians hoped Rouhani would quickly deliver.","TEHRAN — Thirty-five years after the founding of its Islamic republic, Iran is in the midst of a transformative period, with signs that its relations with the United States are warming in a way that was hardly imaginable when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned here from exile in February 1979.

0,"The United States and five other world powers signed an agreement with Iran over its controversial nuclear program this weekend, a significant step toward resolving this years-long dispute. Iran says it wants to reduce international economic sanctions and, for purposes of its own national dignity, retain a right to a peaceful nuclear program. The U.S. and the five other world powers want to restrict Iran's ability to ever make a nuclear weapon. Some countries not at the talks -- Israel and Arabian Peninsula states such as Saudi Arabia -- want this too, although they think about it differently. You can see right away how these two sets of goals might be tough to balance. An ideal agreement, from the view of the seven countries at the negotiations, would allow Iran to have a peaceful program in a way that completely reassures the outside world that it will be only peaceful. This weekend's deal is the negotiators' best effort at achieving that balance. Israel and Arab states of the Persian Gulf argue that the terms are too soft and that the best deal would not allow Iran to have any nuclear program at all. What follows is a candid assessment of ""the good"" from the deal, which is anything that moves all the parties toward their goals; ""the bad,"" anything that could risk those goals; and ""the ugly,"" the political and strategic complications that would make any diplomat want to pull their hair out. THE GOOD 1. Iran has to roll back the most weapons-ready elements of its nuclear program. It has to ""neutralize"" its stockpile of uranium that has been enriched to 20 percent, which is not weapons grade but is close enough that it could be converted relatively quickly. It has to dismantle any equipment that could be used to enrich uranium beyond 5 percent. 2. Iran agreed to freeze many, but not all, of its nuclear activities. It can't develop any uranium above 5 percent enrichment (energy-grade uranium is enriched to 3.5 percent). It can't build more facilities or install more centrifuges. It also has to stop all work at its under-construction nuclear reactor at Arak, which Iran insists is peaceful but which is designed in such a way that could make it very efficient at producing plutonium. 3. The United Nations nuclear watchdog gets daily inspections. The International Atomic Energy Agency will visit the most sensitive sites every day and will install cameras to monitor the facilities remotely. 4. Iran gets access to $4.2 billion in its frozen overseas assets. That money will come in installments as Iran fulfills its commitments. Some sanctions will also be eased on Iranian trade, worth an estimated $1.5 billion. It's not enough to turn around the Iranian economy, but it's a good-faith gesture meant to prove to Iran that cooperating is in their economic interest. This makes it easier for Iranian leaders to sell the deal at home. 5. Iran gets an implicit acknowledgment of a right to enrich. Iranian leaders have emphasized over and over that they want the world to acknowledge their sovereign right to enrich uranium, which they see as a show of their independence and national greatness. And past United Nations sanctions have ordered Iran to halt all enrichment. This deal does not explicitly say that the world recognizes Iran's right to enrich uranium. But it doesn't deny it, either, and you'll notice that it doesn't forbid Iran from using some of its preexisting nuclear facilities or from developing uranium up to 5 percent enriched. By meeting a top Iranian demand, this makes Tehran's adherence to the deal more likely. 6. China and Russia are on board. These two powers joined in signing the deal, along with the U.S. and Western European countries. That's significant because Moscow and Beijing are more closely aligned with Tehran; they also both have a habit of breaking with Western powers. The fact that all these countries are on the same page makes it much easier to enforce the deal and to see it through. THE BAD 1. It's now more likely that the sanctions coalition could fall apart. For example, if China and Russia disagree with the United States and Europe over the next steps, or over whether Iran is holding to its end of the deal, then their unified front could collapse. It's also possible that European leaders could split with the United States. In the worst case, Iran could renege and the international sanctions that the Obama administration worked so hard to put together could fall apart. 2. Speaking of Iran reneging, that could happen. A less comprehensive deal for Iran to halt all enrichment, signed in 2004, fell apart within about a year. Since then, Iran's nuclear program has grown considerably, including with clandestine nuclear activities. 3. Israel and some Arab states worry it could be an Iranian ploy. They warn that Tehran could use this deal to weaken sanctions while continuing to develop its nuclear program. If they're right, that's bad because this outcome would deepen the crisis. Even if they're wrong, it's still bad because their opposition makes the deal less viable. It also raises the possibility that they'll take more unilateral action against Iran, risking greater tension in a region that already has plenty. 4. Iran gets an implicit right to enrich. This one is listed under ""the good"" but it could also be bad because it drops the long-standing U.N. demand that Iran halt all enrichment. By implicitly giving that up, Iran is allowed to remain a step closer to a nuclear weapons program. It would also be much tougher to reinstate that demand later on. THE UGLY 1. The deal only lasts for six months. It's interim, which is good in that the risks are lower if it falls apart, but also means that the negotiation process starts over almost immediately. This weekend's deal addressed all of the key challenges, but it didn't actually resolve anything since it expires in half a year. 2. A permanent version of this deal would be much tougher to make. The biggest hurdle may be United Nations sanctions. Western powers will probably want the U.N. Security Council to pass a new, temporary resolution every year or so ""pausing"" sanctions; that way, if they believe Iran is not holding to its end, sanctions will be easy to reinstitute. The Iranian government, which sincerely fears that the West seeks its destruction, will likely object that this is insufficient assurance that the West will hold to its end and will insist that the U.N. repeal sanctions outright. 3. It could fall apart in Washington or Tehran. Skeptics in both capitals could try to scuttle the deal. The United States, for example, promised no new sanctions for six months; Congress is trying to pass new sanctions anyway. President Obama will surely veto them, but Congress could win enough votes to overrule him, almost certainly killing negotiations. Tehran's hard-liners can get noisy as well. While Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei appears to have blessed negotiations and is the ultimate authority, he's also been reluctant at times to challenge internal hard-liners. Groups such as the Revolutionary Guards could also quietly pressure Khamenei to renege on Iran's pledges. 4. It doesn't address other disputes with Iran. The United States will inevitably face a dilemma over its own sanctions, which are punishments not just for Iran's nuclear program but for, among other things, its sponsorship of international terrorism. At some point, do the United States and Iran need to solve those issues as well in order to make a deal work? 5. It could reshape Middle East politics in unforeseen ways. Tension between the West and Iran has been a defining feature of the region since Iran's 1979 revolution. If that tension eases, no one can say for sure what would happen to the region's frail order -- particularly given that opposition to Iran has long brought together Western power, Israel and Arab countries. If the deal goes forward, what will this mean for the troubled Israel-Palestine peace process? For the worsening relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? Between Israel and Europe? No one can say, and uncertainty is never welcome in the Middle East.","The United States and five other world powers signed an agreement with Iran over its controversial nuclear program this weekend, a significant step toward resolving this years-long dispute.

0,"The United States is preparing to lead a possible military strike on Syria following allegations of a chemical weapon attack near Damascus last week that killed scores. Here are answers to seven questions about the situation in Syria, global reaction and where we go from here. What is the United States going to do?  In an interview with “PBS Newshour” on Aug. 28, President Obama said that the administration had concluded that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons and would repsond in some way, but did not specify any U.S. decision on possible airstrikes. David Nakamura explains: Obama has said the use of chemical weapons would represent a “red line,” and administration officials are reportedly leaning toward a limited military response that would include bombings of strategic Syrian targets, but not the chemical weapon stockpiles that are thought to be hidden throughout the country. 
Administration officials have said that the goal would not be to remove Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power but to deliver a strong message that the international community will not abide the use of chemical agents. 
  Does Congress need to approve airstrikes before they happen?  The White House has not indicated that the administration would seek Congress’ approval before taking military action. Members of Congress from both parties have written and co-signed letters asking Obama to seek congressional approval prior to airstrikes. House Speaker John Boehner has also asked Obama to consult with Congress about possible military action. David Nakamura explains: On Wednesday, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) sent a letter to Obama demanding that he personally “make the case to the American people and Congress for how potential military action will secure American national security interests.” 
Obama briefed Boehner during a phone call Thursday afternoon, according to Boehner’s spokesman Brendan Buck. The speaker pressed Obama on the concerns outlined in his letter, Buck said, adding that “it is clear that further dialogue and consultation with Congress, as well as communication with the American public, will be needed.” 
  So is this the first time chemical weapons have been used?  No. Chemical weapons have been used in the past but are a rarity. This incident would be the first major use of chemical weapons by a government against its own people in decades. Ernesto Londono explains: If the weapons were deployed by the Syrian government, as Western officials allege, it would represent the first major chemical weapons attack by a nation against its own citizens since Saddam Hussein gassed Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988, an act so barbaric it galvanized the movement for a world free of chemical weapons. 
  What is the expected timeline of possible military action? U.S. allies Britain and France have said they want to delay military action until they have the results of the U.N. inspections. U.N.

Anthony Faiola reports: “It would be unthinkable to proceed if there was overwhelming opposition in the [U.N.] Security Council,” Cameron told Parliament. 
At the same time, the prime minister offered an impassioned argument for authorizing military action. He said evidence clearly indicates that the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for the deadly attack and declared that the West has an obligation to deter a possible repeat of “one of the most abhorrent uses of chemical weapons in a century.” 
  The British government also released a report Thursday that explained, “Military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting further such attacks would be necessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable.” France | Faiola reports that France also seeks to delay military action: French officials also are calling for a delay in action until U.N. inspectors conclude their report. “Before acting, we need proof,” said Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, a minister and government spokeswoman, according to Bloomberg News. 
  Russia | Will Engulnd reports that Russia is accusing the West of jumping the gun on Syria. A British resolution in the U.N. Security Council condemning the Syrian government for using chemical weapons is premature given that the inspectors in Syria have not yet reported back on their findings, Russia’s first deputy foreign minister, Vladimir Titov, said in remarks quoted by the Interfax news agency. 
  China | William Van writes that China is urging the United States to exercise restraint. “China calls on all parties to exercise restraint and calm,” said China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi. He said a political solution was “the only realistic way out on the Syrian issue.” 
Wang’s statement, posted on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Web site, was accompanied by a chorus of harsher editorials in China’s state-controlled media, accusing Western powers of rushing to judgment and using chemical weapons as an excuse to cover up less righteous motives. 
  Iran | Iranian officials have warned against U.S.-led military intervention in Syria and alluded to possible counterattacks on Israel. Jason Rezaian explains: Iranian officials on Wednesday warned against a possible U.S.-led military strike on Syria in the wake of an alleged chemical weapons attack there last week. 
While some Iranian lawmakers implied that any foreign military intervention in Syria would result in counterattacks on Israel, the Islamic republic’s top leaders say their priority is averting a larger war in the Middle East. 
  Israel | While the U.S. and its allies are debating military action, nervous Israelis are rushing for gas masks. William Booth and Ruth Eglash report from Jerusalem: A shortage of gas masks caused a mini-melee among panicky moms pushing strollers here Wednesday, as Israelis prepared for possible U.S. airstrikes against Syria that could trigger retaliatory attacks in Israel. 
  How are people in Syria responding to all of this?  Residents of Damascus are anxiously awaiting a military strike. Loveday Morris and Ahmed Ramadan report from Beirut: While potential options for military intervention were debated in the West, Damascenes did what little they could to prepare. The streets of the city were unusually quiet as residents said many had taken the day off work or joined thousands who have fled for neighboring Lebanon. 
 ","The United States is preparing to lead a possible military strike on Syria following allegations of a chemical weapon attack near Damascus last week that killed scores. Here are answers to seven questions about the situation in Syria, global reaction and where we go from here. What is the United States going to do?  In an interview with “PBS Newshour” on Aug. 28, President Obama said that the administration had concluded that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons and would repsond in some way, but did not specify any U.S. decision on possible airstrikes. David Nakamura explains: Obama has said the use of chemical weapons would represent a “red line,” and administration officials are reportedly leaning toward a limited military response that would include bombings of strategic Syrian targets, but not the chemical weapon stockpiles that are thought to be hidden throughout the country. 
Administration officials have said that the goal would not be to remove Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power but to deliver a strong message that the international community will not abide the use of chemical agents. 
  Does Congress need to approve airstrikes before they happen?  The White House has not indicated that the administration would seek Congress’ approval before taking military action. Members of Congress from both parties have written and co-signed letters asking Obama to seek congressional approval prior to airstrikes. House Speaker John Boehner has also asked Obama to consult with Congress about possible military action. David Nakamura explains: On Wednesday, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) sent a letter to Obama demanding that he personally “make the case to the American people and Congress for how potential military action will secure American national security interests.” 
Obama briefed Boehner during a phone call Thursday afternoon, according to Boehner’s spokesman Brendan Buck. The speaker pressed Obama on the concerns outlined in his letter, Buck said, adding that “it is clear that further dialogue and consultation with Congress, as well as communication with the American public, will be needed.” 
  So is this the first time chemical weapons have been used?  No. Chemical weapons have been used in the past but are a rarity. This incident would be the first major use of chemical weapons by a government against its own people in decades. Ernesto Londono explains: If the weapons were deployed by the Syrian government, as Western officials allege, it would represent the first major chemical weapons attack by a nation against its own citizens since Saddam Hussein gassed Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988, an act so barbaric it galvanized the movement for a world free of chemical weapons. 
  What is the expected timeline of possible military action? U.S. allies Britain and France have said they want to delay military action until they have the results of the U.N. inspections. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said that the United Nations team would leave Syria on Saturday and brief him immediately. It is expected that the U.N. Security Council will be briefed on the findings before any airstrike takes place. What are possible targets of U.S. airstrikes?  On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said, “We are prepared.

1,"VIENNA — The United States and Iran moved into a new era of international relations Saturday, with the implementation of a landmark agreement on Iran’s nuclear program on a drama-filled day that also saw the release of imprisoned Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and four other Americans. U.S. and European officials lifted the harshest economic sanctions against Tehran after the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog certified that the Islamic republic had fully complied with promises to curtail key parts of its nuclear program. Hours before diplomats in the Austrian capital hailed the official activation of the nuclear deal, Iran confirmed the release of Rezaian and the other American detainees, set free in exchange for U.S. clemency offered to seven Iranians charged or imprisoned for sanctions violations and the dismissal of outstanding charges against 14 Iranians outside the United States. Rezaian and two other released Americans were flown out of Tehran on Sunday, after a delay. They were expected to go to Switzerland, then to a U.S. military facility in Germany to be examined by medical personnel. One of the Americans, Nosratollah ­Khosravi-Roodsari, did not fly out with the others, U.S. officials said. “We can confirm that our detained U.S. citizens have been released and that those who wished to depart Iran have left,” a senior administration official said. “We have no further information to share at this time and would ask that everyone respect the privacy of these individuals and their families.” The coordinated moves cemented a major diplomatic victory for the Obama administration, which won significant nuclear concessions from Iran in an effort to defuse an international crisis that threatened to spark a new Middle East war. The agreement also frees Iran from crippling economic sanctions and opens the way for ending decades of diplomatic and economic isolation. “This evening, we are really reminded once again of diplomacy’s power to tackle significant challenges,” Secretary of State John F. Kerry said after the implementation was announced. “We have approached this challenge with the firm belief that exhausting diplomacy before choosing war is an imperative. And we believe that today marks the benefits of that choice.” But the agreement also contains significant political risk for a White House that is staking its legacy on Iran’s willingness to comply with unprecedented curbs and extensive monitoring of its nuclear program. The pact — which has been repeatedly condemned by the Israeli government as well as by members of Congress from both parties — drew fresh attacks Saturday from Republican presidential contenders, some of whom blasted the deal as a sellout to Iran’s clerical rulers. The nuclear pact calls on Iran to dismantle key nuclear equipment in a deal designed to ensure that Iranian officials could never accumulate enough fissile material to build a nuclear bomb. The agreement also requires unprecedented inspections and monitoring covering all aspects of Iran’s nuclear program, from uranium mining to research facilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif echoed Kerry’s remarks, saying on Twitter that “diplomacy requires patience, but we all know that it sure beats the alternatives.” Implementation of the deal, Zarif said, meant that “it’s now time for all — especially Muslim nations — to join hands and rid the world of violent extremism. Iran is ready.” The release of prisoners had not been officially part of negotiations between Iran and the six world powers: the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. But Kerry frequently raised the plight of imprisoned U.S. citizens during last year’s nuclear talks. The Obama administration had come under heavy criticism for concluding the nuclear accord without winning the release of American detainees, including Rezaian, 39, whose 544-day detention is the longest ever by a Western journalist in Iran. White House officials confirmed that the swap was clinched during months of secret talks that gained momentum in the days before the nuclear pact was formally implemented. “Friends and colleagues at The Washington Post are elated by the wonderful news that Jason Rezaian has been released from Evin Prison and has safely left the country with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi,” said Frederick J. Ryan Jr., publisher of The Post. “We are enormously grateful to all who played a role in securing his release. Our deep appreciation also goes to the many government leaders, journalists, human rights advocates and others around the world who have spoken out on Jason’s behalf and against the harsh confinement that was so wrongly imposed upon him,” he said. “Now a free man, Jason will be reunited with his family, including his brother Ali, his most effective and tireless advocate. We look forward to the joyous occasion of welcoming him back to the Washington Post newsroom,” Ryan said. Iran’s judiciary announced the release in Tehran as part of an exchange. The United States is releasing seven people charged with violating sanctions against Iran, U.S. and Iranian officials said. A senior U.S. official said the “Iranians wanted a goodwill gesture” in response to the release of the Americans. A list of Iranians submitted to U.S. authorities was “whittled down” to exclude any crimes related to violence or terrorism, said the official, one of several who spoke on the condition of anonymity under administration ground rules. Another official said the exchange was a “one-time arrangement because it was an opportunity to bring Americans home” and should not be considered something that would “encourage this behavior in the future” by Iran. The officials did not tie the release directly to the nuclear talks and said they had not wanted the detained Americans to be “used as leverage” in the negotiations. But, they said, completion of the nuclear deal last July greatly accelerated talks about the prisoners. In addition to Rezaian, the Americans freed Saturday included Saeed Abedini, 35, of Boise, Idaho; Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, 32, of Flint, Mich.; and Khosravi-Roodsari, U.S. and Iranian officials said. A fifth American, identified as language student Matt Trevithick, was also released Saturday but was not part of the exchange deal. Trevithick’s parents said in a statement that he had been held for 40 days in Evin Prison. A senior U.S. official said Trevithick, 30, has already left Iran. Abedini is a Christian pastor who had been imprisoned since July 2012 for organizing home churches. Hekmati is a former Marine who spent more than four years in prison on spying charges following his arrest in August 2011 during a visit to see his grandmother. The detention of Khosravi-Roodsari had not been previously publicized. Iranian state television identified him as a businessman. Little else was known about him. A senior administration official said of Trevithick, “We wanted him, obviously, to be a direct part of this, and made clear to Iranians that [his release] would be an appropriate humanitarian gesture.” The exchange quickly became political fodder in the United States among Republicans vying for the GOP presidential nomination. Republican front-runner Donald Trump said it was “a total disgrace” that the release of the Americans took so long. “This should have been done three, four years ago, when the [nuclear] deal was struck. Before the deal was made­ . . . they should have said, ‘We want our prisoners back,’ ” Trump said at a rally in New Hampshire. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said in a television interview Saturday: “We’d be very happy for the families of the Americans who are going to be home and for those Americans, but I’d also want to hear what the other side of the deal is, if this president is releasing more terrorists from Guantanamo to go back and reenter the war on terror. . . . We shouldn’t have to swap prisoners. These folks were taken illegally in violation of international law, and they should have been released without condition.” Rezaian’s ordeal damaged his health, drew protests from media and human rights groups, and hampered efforts to improve relations between Washington and Tehran. It also exposed fault lines and infighting in Iran’s opaque political system, where Rezaian and other detained Americans appeared to become pawns in a larger internal struggle between hard-liners and reformists seeking to improve ties with the West. Rezaian was tried last year behind closed doors on vague charges of espionage and other alleged offenses and was sentenced to an unspecified prison term. His 2014 arrest and subsequent trial and conviction in Iran’s secretive Revolutionary Court system — on charges that were never publicly disclosed or substantiated — appeared to reflect a power play by hard-liners fiercely loyal to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, against more moderate reformist elements under President Hassan Rouhani. The hard-liners control Iran’s security forces, intelligence apparatus, judiciary and most other levers of power, while Rouhani — though answerable to Khamenei — has been given relatively free rein to manage Iran’s foreign affairs and improve its economy. In recent weeks, Iran took significant steps to meet its obligations under the deal. Increased U.S.-Iranian cooperation appeared to be on display Wednesday when Iran released 10 U.S. sailors within a day after they were seized by Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps naval forces in the Persian Gulf. The Americans were on two small riverine boats that strayed into Iranian waters. Against this backdrop, the signs of rapprochement raised hopes for a resolution in Rezaian’s case. Rezaian was arrested along with his wife when security forces raided their home July 22, 2014. Yeganeh Salehi, 31, a journalist who worked for the Abu Dhabi newspaper the National, was released on bail in October, but Rezaian languished in Evin Prison for months without trial or even specific charges. Rezaian holds both U.S. and Iranian citizenship. But Iran, which does not recognize dual nationality, barred any U.S. role in the case, including consular visits by Swiss diplomats representing U.S. interests. Diplomatic relations between Washington and Tehran were severed in 1980 during the Iranian hostage crisis. The last of four Revolutionary Court sessions was held in August, but it was not until October that a court spokesman announced a conviction — without providing any details. In November, the court said Rezaian was sentenced to a prison term, again with no elaboration. In the meantime, Iranian officials floated the idea of a prisoner swap with the United States. Rouhani even suggested that Tehran could free Rezaian and at least two other Iranian American prisoners if Washington reciprocated by releasing 19 Iranian citizens convicted in the United States of circumventing sanctions. As if to buttress that proposal, state-run news media in Iran then reported that Rezaian was accused of “spying on Iran’s nuclear programs” and giving the U.S. government information on people and companies evading sanctions. Branigin, DeYoung and Warrick reported from Washington. Ellen Nakashima, Julie Tate and Ariana Cha contributed to this report.

0,"The family of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, convicted in an Iranian court over the weekend of charges that included espionage, decried his trial and the verdict, as did journalists around the world. [Iranian TV says Post correspondent Jason Rezaian convicted] ""Today's announcement by the Iranian government that a ruling has been issued regarding the case of my brother, Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, is unfortunately just another sad chapter in his 14-month illegal imprisonment and opaque trial process,"" Jason's brother, Ali Rezaian, said in a statement. ""It follows an unconscionable pattern by Iranian authorities of silence, obfuscation, delay and a total lack of adherence to international law, as well as Iranian law. The Iranian government has never provided any proof of the trumped-up espionage and other charges against Jason, so today's vague statement on a purported verdict, while certainly disappointing to our family, is not surprising."" Rezaian was arrested along with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, when security forces raided their home last year. He went on trial in May. More from Ali Rezaian's statement: ""While the status of any verdict in his case remains unclear, there is much about Jason we know for certain. Jason was simply a journalist doing his job and following all the rules when he was wrongly arrested and imprisoned in Tehran's infamous Evin prison. He is an innocent man that has been kept under harsh conditions to the detriment of his health and well-being for nearly 450 days. There is worldwide condemnation for the Iranian government's unlawful detention of Jason and calls from across the globe for his immediate release. We remain hopeful that Jason will soon be released and reunited with this family."" Martin Baron, executive editor of the Post, called the verdict an ""outrageous injustice."" ""Iran has behaved unconscionably throughout this case, but never more so than with this indefensible decision by a Revolutionary Court to convict an innocent journalist of serious crimes after a proceeding that unfolded in secret, with no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing. For now, no sentence has been announced."" Edward Snowden, the U.S. contractor who fled to Russia after leaking documents on government surveillance programs, called the conviction shocking and said it ""must not stand."" State Department spokesman John Kirby said that — although news reports on Rezaian's conviction were out — there was no ""official confirmation of a verdict on specific charges or any further information."" Anthony Bourdain, host of CNN's ""Parts Unknown,"" had Rezaian and Salehi on his show when he was in Tehran. John Hughes, president of the National Press Club, called Rezaian's trial a sham and said he ""must be set free."" ""Iran has tried to make its point with this conviction that it can do whatever it wants in its legal system. Now he must be released and returned to his family. He has done nothing wrong. Iran knows this. Shame on them."" Journalists, many who tweeted using the hashtag #freejason, condemned the decision. ""Convicting Rezaian, testing missiles, troops into Syria,"" David Rothkopf of Foreign Policy tweeted. ""Those who thought deal would change Iran ... well, not so much."" ""@AP says that an Iranian court has convicted Jason Rezaian,"" Foreign Policy's Middle East editor David Kenner said. ""Farce."" [New statement from Martin Baron on The Post’s Jason Rezaian] Some decried the murkiness of the conviction, about which few details were immediately available.

[Iranian TV says Post correspondent Jason Rezaian convicted] ""Today's announcement by the Iranian government that a ruling has been issued regarding the case of my brother, Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, is unfortunately just another sad chapter in his 14-month illegal imprisonment and opaque trial process,"" Jason's brother, Ali Rezaian, said in a statement. ""It follows an unconscionable pattern by Iranian authorities of silence, obfuscation, delay and a total lack of adherence to international law, as well as Iranian law. The Iranian government has never provided any proof of the trumped-up espionage and other charges against Jason, so today's vague statement on a purported verdict, while certainly disappointing to our family, is not surprising."" Rezaian was arrested along with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, when security forces raided their home last year. He went on trial in May. More from Ali Rezaian's statement: ""While the status of any verdict in his case remains unclear, there is much about Jason we know for certain. Jason was simply a journalist doing his job and following all the rules when he was wrongly arrested and imprisoned in Tehran's infamous Evin prison. He is an innocent man that has been kept under harsh conditions to the detriment of his health and well-being for nearly 450 days. There is worldwide condemnation for the Iranian government's unlawful detention of Jason and calls from across the globe for his immediate release. We remain hopeful that Jason will soon be released and reunited with this family."" Martin Baron, executive editor of the Post, called the verdict an ""outrageous injustice."" ""Iran has behaved unconscionably throughout this case, but never more so than with this indefensible decision by a Revolutionary Court to convict an innocent journalist of serious crimes after a proceeding that unfolded in secret, with no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing. For now, no sentence has been announced."" Edward Snowden, the U.S. contractor who fled to Russia after leaking documents on government surveillance programs, called the conviction shocking and said it ""must not stand."" State Department spokesman John Kirby said that — although news reports on Rezaian's conviction were out — there was no ""official confirmation of a verdict on specific charges or any further information."" Anthony Bourdain, host of CNN's ""Parts Unknown,"" had Rezaian and Salehi on his show when he was in Tehran. John Hughes, president of the National Press Club, called Rezaian's trial a sham and said he ""must be set free."" ""Iran has tried to make its point with this conviction that it can do whatever it wants in its legal system. Now he must be released and returned to his family. He has done nothing wrong. Iran knows this. Shame on them."" Journalists, many who tweeted using the hashtag #freejason, condemned the decision. ""Convicting Rezaian, testing missiles, troops into Syria,"" David Rothkopf of Foreign Policy tweeted. ""Those who thought deal would change Iran ... well, not so much."" ""@AP says that an Iranian court has convicted Jason Rezaian,"" Foreign Policy's Middle East editor David Kenner said. ""Farce.""
